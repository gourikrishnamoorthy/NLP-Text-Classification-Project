Creation,euzput,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,Let's explain: Compound probabilities as they relate to back mutations,"A [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/ffrep0z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) between myself and DarwinZDF42 explored the relationship between probabilities and back mutations. He was insistent that a back mutation was roughly equal in probability to the original, and in so doing he aims to suggest that they are a significant factor to consider which ameliorates the problem of deleterious mutations in the genome. This could not be further from the truth, and I'll try to succinctly explain why using a simple math example.  


Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.

Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.   


Now we can do some very simple math to find out which is more likely-- getting two different mutations, or getting a back mutation of the first mutation in our second mutation.  


The first of the two mutations is not specified--it is random and it could be anything. So the probability of the first mutation is 1. All values equally likely.  


Now for the second mutation. If it is NOT a back mutation, then that means we have only one value which is disallowed: the value that would produce a back mutation. Since the first mutation took one possible value away from us, that leaves us 29 remaining possibilities. That is a likelihood of 29/30.  


Since for compound probabilities we multiply, then the likelihood of getting two mutations and NOT having the second reverse the first would be (1) \* (29/30). We have a high probability of not reversing the first mutation. Notice how the level of certainty that we will NOT get a back mutation only goes up and up the larger the number of possibilities becomes.  


Contrariwise, if we want to see the likelihood of getting two mutations and having the second one reverse the first one ( a back mutation ), we just multiply our two compound probabilities once more, this time inverting the number. We landed on one of the 30 possible choices with mutation #1, and so for the second mutation we have only one possible mutation out of 30 that would result in a back mutation. That's 1/30.   


I hope this simple explanation will suffice to explain why back mutations are so unlikely. In our oversimplified example of a tiny genome of 10 base pairs (compared to 3 billion), the difference in probability for getting a back mutation is the difference of 29/30 versus 1/30 or .967 compared to .033.",57,1580181625,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/
Creation,eupqxz,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,Let's pick apart DarwinZDF42's grand theory of mutations - his answer to Genetic Entropy,"Our friend and neighbor DarwinZDF42 is well known for trashing Dr. John Sanford and his ideas about Genetic Entropy furiously and often. You know you're over the target when you're taking flak!  


Most of what he's written on this topic in the past has been smoke and mirrors, unfortunately. But now, at my request, he has been kind enough to lay his cards on the table openly and explain HIS grand theory of mutational accumulation.  


I want to home in on a few of the most important and salient points he made.  


&gt; There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur. 

This statement plainly runs contrary to science. In reality, the vast majority of all possible mutations are deleterious. The only real variable is *how* deleterious.   


**""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007;Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""**

[**https://www.ge**netics.org/content/204/3/1225](https://www.genetics.org/content/204/3/1225)

Dillon, M. and Cooper, V., The Fitness Effects of Spontaneous Mutations Nearly Unseen by Selection in a Bacterium with Multiple Chromosomes,

GENETICS November 1, 2016 vol. 204 no. 3 1225-1238

**""In summary, the vast majority of mutations are deleterious. This is one of the most well-established principles of evolutionary genetics, supported by both molecular and quantitative-genetic data.""**

Keightley P.D., and Lynch, M., Toward a realistic model of mutations affecting fitness, Evolution, 57(3):683–5, 2003.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations. 

This possibility is so rare and unlikely as to be completely negligible when considering our fitness distribution. Back mutations are like having lighting strike at the same spot twice, since mutations are random and the genome is very, very large.  


Think about this: the human genome contains [3 billion base pairs](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ). What he is saying is that once you change one of these for the worse (most mutations are very small), then it's technically possible that another mutation could come along and hit the same spot and put it back to where it was before.  


Well, yeah, that *could* happen, but it's so vastly unlikely as to be negligible. That explains why this is such a rare phenomenon. In some cases, it may even represent evidence of genomic repair mechanisms that are not yet well understood ([in other words, it may not be random at all](https://creation.com/at-last-a-good-mutation))!  


&gt; The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact. 

DarwinZDF42 isn't clear on why epistasis is supposed to help his case. The fact that mutations interact actually makes the whole problem worse for various reasons. For one thing, synergistic epistasis means they work together. This means that the damage caused by multiple deleterious mutations becomes not just additive, but exponential, as the mutations are worse in combination than they would be apart!  


And then you have antagonistic epistasis, where they work against each other. This makes beneficial mutations *less helpful*, since sometimes a beneficial mutation ceases being beneficial when combined with another beneficial mutation! This is particularly bad considering how rare these types of mutations are to begin with.   


Dr. John Sanford has dealt at length with the problem of epistasis, both in his book and this [exhaustive numerical simulation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0013). Epistasis is simply no way out of the entropy problem.  


&gt; Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated. 

Here he shows that he still does not really understand the problem of genetic entropy. The idea is not that most mutations are unselectable until they reach a certain threshold. Where he got this from I don't know. The idea is that most mutations are unselectable, period. They just keep on damaging things and natural selection keeps on failing to notice them because they are too small.  


**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

&amp;#x200B;

**""In terms of evolutionary dynamics, however, mutations whose effects are very small ... are expected to be dominated by drift rather than selection.""**

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094782](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094782)

The threshold is not at the level of the individual, as even Kimura himself understood. The threshold is at the level of the **population as a whole**. These mutations are happening constantly in every member of the population! Each human being has about 100 new mutations compared to their parents. Selection only works relative to other members of the population, but if everybody is degenerating at roughly the same gradual rate, then selection is powerless to stop this. Do you see DarwinZDF42's attempt at a sleight of hand here?  


I anticipated this a while back when I wrote the following article, published in Creation magazine:  
 **Genetic Entropy: The Silent Killer,** ***Creation*** **41(4):48–50, 2019** 

  
It's not yet published to the website, but I'll quote a short excerpt here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Forced to acknowledge that NS is blind to nearly-neutral mutations, a common evolutionist response is, ‘Once the accumulating damage from the mutations becomes significant, NS will start to remove them.’ But this fails to understand the problem. Natural selection can only weed out individual mutations as they happen. Once mutations have accumulated enough to be a real, noticeable problem, they are then a problem in the entire population, not just in an individual here or there. The whole population cannot be ‘selected away’—except by going extinct!",88,1580140688,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/

I wrote years ago aidea, cool idea but poorly written, a essay called ""POST FLOOD MARSUPIAL MIGRATION EXPLAINED"" by Robert Byers. Just google.

In it I explain that marsupials did not in a group travel to Australia/S america etc and all other creatures refused to travel those ways but instead all creatures filled the earth quickly as God commanded without exception. Therefore the marsupial traits of reproduction or a few antomical details mutually held were just picked upon migration to those areas. The great evidence for this being the OBVIOUS same bodyplan/shape of marsupials with other critters elsewhere. There were marsupial lions, wolves, mice, moles etc etc. The pouch thing was a trivial detail and wrong to classify them by those trivial details. most of organized creationism still does say marsupials were on the ark and joined hands on the march to Aussietopia. An absurdity if one thinks about but they can't imagine how bodyplans could change under envirormental influence. likewise I show that in the fossil record there were other groups of creatures said also to not be related despite perfect bodyplan forms.

Creation,ethnl0,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.Creation,,The RNA World Hypothesis,"The RNA World Hypothesis: The Failure of Modern Origin-of-Life Theories

The RNA world hypothesis is the most developed origin-of-life theories so far, and it tries to explain how information in DNA, metabolism, and life itself originated. However, this post will show the utter failure of this theory to actually explain the origin of life.

The main premise of this theory is that, before the first living cells originated, the prebiotic world was composed of RNA and, later, RNA viruses. As RNA has been seen to self-replicate in some cases, and ribozymes, or catalytic enzymes like polymerases made of RNA, have been shown to exist, it is assumed that RNA could take the place of both DNA and proteins.

Once the first ribozyme polymerase (able to copy other RNA strands) originated, then strands could replicate, and the laws of natural selection and mutation could take over from there. As more and more complex ribozymes began to originate, and simple lipid cell membranes took them into their cavities, then simple metabolism could evolve. After this, ribonucleoproteins such as ribosomes could take over, and finally, simple cellular life could evolve.

The first hurdle that this theory comes to is the chemical evolution of nucleobases (A, U, G, and C). These are the molecules that encode information in DNA and cause ribozymes to work. Although some scientists suggest that specific nucleobases, such as adenine (A) [can be made by natural processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077245/), others accept that [nucleobases are unlikely to be created naturally](https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4396). Even to make a 0.5% concentration of adenine take unrealistically high concentrations of HCN that likely did not exist in early oceans. In our cells, there is a complex sequence of specific, metabolic proteins to make nucleobases. Also, the reaction that makes nucleobases from HCN makes many undesirable products that would interfere with RNA production.

Also, nucleobases have [very short half-lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20907/). At the temperatures of hydrothermal vents (more than 100 degrees Celsius), cytosine has a half-life of only 19 days, which means that the origin of life would have to have take place within only several years. I can’t stress enough how unlikely this would be.

The second hurdle the theory comes to is the making of ribose sugar. Ribose is the first component of the backbone of RNA (and the R in RNA). There is already a natural process that makes this sugar called the [formose reaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) which begins with formaldehyde. This has even been observed to take place at the temperatures and pressures of hydrothermal vents. The only problem with this is that [it cannot take place in the presence of nitrogenous compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453009), such as the ones that are formed from the production of nucleobases, This is because nitrogenous compounds would chemically react with the formaldehyde that is needed to start the reaction.

So, proponents of the RNA world theory need to explain how ribose could be made apart from the nucleobases, then come in contact with them in a high enough concentration to provoke a *thermodynamically uphill reaction*.

This brings us to the theory’s third hurdle, which is the making of nucleotides. These are the fundamental units of RNA, that are made from a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate ion. To form this, there would need to be a high concentration of phosphate. However, because phosphate is an ion, it is generally trapped in stable minerals. Any free PO^-3 will be quickly ‘snapped up’ by free calcium ions in the ocean. Though [some origin-of-life researchers think this could be solved with sulfur](https://cosmosmagazine.com/chemistry/life-without-phosphate-mystery-solved), there is no known analogue to RNA with anything other than phosphate.

Another problem with this is that the combination of nucleobases, ribose, and phosphate is a *thermodynamically uphill* reaction. To make nucleotides would require an outside source of energy and an extremely high concentration of each of these things, which is unlikely for the reasons previously mentioned.

Also, you need to make sure that the right nitrogen atom from the nucleobase bonds with the right carbon atom on the ribose sugar. In studies, only [8% of bonds were in the right place](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar50083a002), showing that even if the molecules did combine to form a nucleotide, 92% of them would be wrong, so any RNA strand formed from these would be extremely unlikely to work.

The final challenge to this theory, and the most problematic, is the actual forming of ribozymes. Even assuming that a significant concentration of nucleotides were formed, there are only a few sequences that actually produce an enzyme, so we run into the same problem as specified information in DNA.

Natural selection and copying could only begin after the first ribozyme polymerase was formed. [The shortest effective one yet is called 24-3](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9786), and it needs a specific sequence of bases 188 nucleotides in length to work. The chance of this forming randomly is one in 4^188, or approximately one in 10^113. Even assuming that the concentration was enough to produce a new RNA sequence every second, the chance of this forming in a million years is still one in 10^99. Given that, at best, life is given a billion years in evolutionary time to form, you can be sure that the RNA world literally would never form “in a billion years”.

They gave some arguments against Genetic Entropy, many of which I believe are even fatal to the theory. These are their arguments, since I know many of you don’t want to read the entire post:

Most mutations are neutral, because deleterious and beneficial mutations only happen in protein-coding genes (this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact). The ones that are deleterious only happen to a small percentage of genes at a time, because there are so many genes in the genome. Since the entire genome isn’t being degraded at once, the wild-type which still exists in the population will survive due to the probabilities of genetic drift. And even if some genes escape genetic drift, once they degrade enough they will be selected against. This means that almost all deleterious mutations are eventually removed from the gene pool by drift.

And: Sanford’s H1N1 study that is said to prove genetic entropy is bad because he simply relabels the virulence axis as fitness, whereas virulence and fitness are completely different things. Any other study said to prove genetic entropy must be misunderstood, because many studies have been done, even on organisms that are supposed to be susceptible to entropy. This shows that mutational meltdown cannot be induced in any modern organisms.

Finally: Any genetic entropy seen today is either due to the effect of humans on other animals, or due to the removal of selective pressures on the human gene pool.

I have since eaten what I can only assume is an unhealthy amount of these delicious fruits.  If you haven't had one, you owe it to yourself to get to your local Asian market and get one..

Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starches to simpler sugars. Only living organisms can produce amylase. Animals produce only alpha-amylase. Plants, bacteria, and fungi produce both beta- and alpha- amylases. Like all proteins, the presence of amylase in food depends on if it is permanently denatured by high enough temperatures or extremes in pH. Interestingly, amylases can be classified into high/intermediate/low thermostability groups, depending on whether they become inactivated at a certain temperature. Taking this into consideration, saliva would definitely have alpha-amylase. Bread and biscuits may have alpha or beta amylase (depending on baking temperatures/pH, if amylase was added at all, and if it comes from a grain).  

If it lives,  it contains amylase.

It means, 'To the Man', and is a deflection *from* whatever the topic is, *to* the opponent.   ..ANYTHING  that puts the focus on the premise MAKER, rather than the premise.

Let's say you post a topic: 
*'Mutation and time have no mechanism for increasing complexity.'*

Here are typical ad hominem responses:

You don't understand! 
You need to read a book!
You are ignorant, and need education!
Why do you deny this settled science?
Liar!
You are religious!
You believe xxx!
You are proselytizing! 
Your motivation is to convert people!
You're a troll!
Spammer!
You refuse!
You ignore!
Your behavior is bad!

ANYTHING that shifts the attention from the FACTS and REASONING of the topic, to some personal attribute or accusation toward the person, is ad hominem.   It is not just cussing someone out,  or an insult laden tirade, it is anything 'to the man', that deflects from the topic.

It has become so common, in the modern discourse,  that it is redefined as a 'rational response' for anything that is disagreed with.  And it is such a critical element of the 'debate' climate, that just pointing out ad hominem will elicit howls of indignation, and doubling down of more ad hominem! 

*You don't even know what ad hom is!
Complainer!
Pointing out ad hom IS ad hom!
You're rude and contentious!*

It has become so mainstream that pointing it out will get you banned, and/or start a dogpile of attacks toward the hapless dupe who dares to expose such an essential weapon in the Militant Evolutionist's arsenal.

In the example above, a RATIONAL, topical response would be to address the facts and reasoning of time and mutation,  as a mechanism for increasing complexity...  without multiple references as to how stupid, uneducated, blind, lying, and illogical the premise maker is.  But in most public forums, especially in the origins debate, that does not happen.   Rarely will you get ANY response that is not steeped in ad hominem,  even when they deny it.

Ad hominem is a poor substitute for reason. But it is the favorite substitute, in the origins debate. It is ..evidence..  imo, of the impotence of science, facts, and reasoning behind the belief in common ancestry.  It REVEALS ignorance, Indoctrination, desperation, intolerance,  and irrationality. It is not a tool of a logical, scientific minded person. It is a fallacy, for someone without facts or reason.

ANY open, public discussion will reveal ad hominem as the most used and common fallacy in the origins debate.",20,1579524916,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ercumb/fallacies_in_the_origins_debate_ad_hominem/
Creation,eqv6m8,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Fallacies in the Origins Debate: Gish Gallop!,"This is a peculiar kind of fallacy,  combining poison the well, ad hominem, and dismissal all together in a cutesy deflection.

It is specifically used in origins debate, to dismiss points made by creationists. Some origins forums even use the term in their rules.

What is it?  It was coined by Eugenie Scott, a common ancestry defender, atheist, and vocal opponent of creationism.

From her article in the the talk.origins faq, on How to debate a creationist:  
*""I think they recognize that they have a lot to lose in any other than the ""Gish Gallop"" format. Tough luck. I can't see any reason why evolutionists should make it easier for them to rally their troops.*  

*If after all of this, you still think you want to debate a creationist, then let me give you some suggestions. First, don't bother defending evolution. Evolution is state of the art science, taught at every decent college and university in this country, including Brigham Young, Notre Dame, and Baylor. So why should you defend it? Tell your audience that there is plenty of information on evolution in the library, in university courses, and in scores of science journals. Creation ""science"" is the new kid on the block. Let's see if it fits the criteria of science, and secondly, if its claims and predictions stand up to scrutiny.*  

*And then show the audience how creation science is a bust. Don't bother trying to explain something as complicated as evolution, although during your rebuttal you can straighten the audience out on the creationist's stupider claims.""*  

She coined the phrase to dismiss the presentations of Duane Gish, an early promoter of creationism from the last century.  He would list multiple points in a debate format, and the complaint is that the evolutionist was overwhelmed with points, unable to give a cogent response to any.

From wiki:  
*The Gish gallop is a technique used during debating that focuses on overwhelming an opponent with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength of the arguments. The term was coined by Eugenie Scott and named after the creationist Duane Gish.*

I personally met Duane Gish, and attended several debates, when academia still allowed that sort of thing (they use censorship,  now..).  He did have a wealth of scientific material and knowledge,  and conveyed it with sound logic.  I see the 'Gish Gallop!' accusation as an unfair and demeaning deflection, with no rational basis.  Here is why:

1. The debate formats are the real complaint.  Duane Gish would present as much facts and arguments as possible, in the allotted time.  The evolutionist debater would (allegedly) feel unable to rebut so many points in the shorter rebuttal time allotment.
2. Rather than deal with the ARGUMENTS and FACTS, the evolutionist debater found it much easier to dismiss it all, as a 'Gish Gallop!'  It is an argument of dismissal. 
3. The irony i see is in the hypocrisy among 'Gish Gallop!' accusers, who often employ a similar tactic of flooding a 'debate' with irrelevant cut and pastes &amp; off topic deflections.
4. Not every point can be made in a bumper  sticker soundbite. To dismiss everything, and complain of being overwhelmed by arguments,  is an admission that the rebuttal is impotent in it's response.

Duane Gish died in 2013, at 92 years of age.  The deflective smear that bears his name is a testament to his convincing, rational, and scientific arguments, that elicited terror and dismissal from his opponents.

A personal note:
I became a creationist after attending debates with Duane Gish and Henry Morris, at a midwestern university in 1974.  Coming from a diverse scientific background in physics,  chemistry, and mathematics,  i was impressed with the facts and arguments that these debaters displayed.  I continued in origins, even joining the 'debate' on talk.origins in the 90s.  When i am accused of 'Gish Gallop!' (and anyone who engages in this debate will be),  i am reminded  of the warmth, wit, humor, and crushing rationality of this great father of modern scientific creationism.  I wear his name as a badge of honor..",9,1579433213,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eqv6m8/fallacies_in_the_origins_debate_gish_gallop/
Creation,eqpzlu,SaggysHealthAlt,Science-Denying Creationist,t2_4h4ws52t,self.Creation,,I wrote a small research paper on a simple proof for a Young Earth meant for laymen. Feel free to critique or the work so I can update it with better information. (I will not respond to anything submitted in r/debateevolution so please respond here),"***Abstract: Carbon 14 dates from numerous samples around the United States suggest a death within the last 95,000 years. Coal formation has been proven to occur at an alarmingly different pace from the secular narrative of hundreds of millions of years, as the evidence shows it can occur in less than a single year. Eyewitness testimony suggests that a massive flood is the culprit for the existence of recently buried excessive amounts of plant life fossilized into the coal beds we witness today.***

**I would like to respond to the assumption that coal took hundreds of millions of years to form. First, this has to do with C14 dating. So if you do not know what that is, here is a science lesson. Carbon 14 is an isotope, or an unstable atom, which is also called radiocarbon. This is created in the Earth’s atmosphere after sun rays react with nitrogen 14 that is already in the atmosphere. The reaction forms carbon 14 which is eventually absorbed into the plants around us on the Earth. These plants are eventually eaten by animals, so the C14 in the plant transfers to the animal. We as humans eat animals and plants so the C14 transfers to us. This means you and I are a little radioactive from the radiocarbon inside us. After we die, we obviously no longer eat, so the C14 begins to decay back into nitrogen 14, where it started.** 

**If we want to know the age of when something died, we bring it to a multi million dollar machine called the accelerator mass spectrometre, so we can backtrack the decay to the original amount of C14 that was in the subject before it died. Since we rely on unprovable assumptions such as determining the unknown amount of carbon 14 that was in the subject before it died, we get answers that are hundreds of years to tens of thousands of years off from the true age. We have real examples of this flaw in action by attempting to date known age material which resulted in an age that was far off from the real age.** 

**Fortunately we can agree on one thing. C14 should completely decay back to nitrogen in any plant or animal after a period of 95,000 years after the subject has died, so anything with observable carbon still in it shows that the subject is less than 95,000 years old. However, an eight-year project known as the RATE project which operated from 1997 to 2005 sought out to prove if radiocarbon and radiometric dating were accurate methods to determine the age of dead organisms or rocks. During this research project they were sent ten samples of coal from different layers in the Earth’s crust from different states from the United States department of energy. The RATE project sent the coal samples to a laboratory with the accelerator mass spectrometre and then analyzed the results. The coal came from far underground in areas that seculars consider to be anywhere from 50 million to 300 million years old, so the RATE project was hit with surprise when the coal samples returned with carbon 14 ages, which should not have been possible if the coal was over 95,000 years old. The ages given for each of the samples were relatively similar, which means all these samples came from coal beds that formed during the same time, under 95,000 years ago! This has been considered hard hitting evidence against the coal being millions of years old.** 

**However, there is a popular claim that the coal took hundreds of millions of years to form, so the results given by the laboratory was considered to be contaminated, even though there is no proof that any of these were ever contaminated. So how did all of this coal form so quickly under 95,000 years? Turns out, we have known the solution since the 1980s. Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois in 1983 first discovered that coal took less severe circumstances than originally thought to form after they made a type of artificial coal from naturally occurring materials. In 1985 they were able to make coal completely indistinguishable from natural coal in the ground under a single year by once again, only using naturally occurring material that would have the same effect on the coal found in the ground today. So we have evidence that the coal is under 95,000 years old and can be formed under a single year. This completely disrupts the notion that the geological column is hundreds of millions of years old.** 

**The final piece of this puzzle would be why is the coal beneath us in the first place? We know that the coal is young so must have formed rapidly, what could have caused it? We have an answer from actual eyewitness testimony. Around the world there are over 200 accounts from over 200 cultures that describe that there was once a world of long-living people that were wiped out with a catastrophic flood by divine power. For example, the Hawaiian flood legend says that a man named Nu-u built a large boat to save his family from a flood. His boat eventually landed safely on the mountain called Mount Kea, in which afterwards he sacrificed pigs and coconuts to the moon. In the flood legend, this creator descended from a rainbow to reveal himself as the one who saved mankind.**

**Based on successful scientific probabilities and the historically accurate events given afterwards, the flood account from the Biblical book of Genesis is considered the true account, especially when compared to the obvious fallibility of some of the coexisting records, such as the Akkadian flood legend, in which the boat dimensions described would kill everything inside during a worldwide flood.**

**In the flood account given in Genesis, a place called the “Fountains of the Great Deep” were broken up by God, which resulted in igniting the Great Flood which occurred afterward, as scientific consensus of Creation Scientists have concluded that the “Fountains of the Great Deep” are actually the fault lines. A rapid breaking up of these lines would result in massive continental shifting that would cause countless tidal waves and tsunamis to destroy and kill anything that was not on the divinely protected Ark, which carried the family and animals that were spared by The God who sent the flood. The synchronized reshaping of the Earth and destruction of countless forests and jungles on the Antediluvian planet resulted in the now destroyed plant life to be crushed under the sediments laid down after the deluge. The chronology given to date this event was roughly four and a half thousand years ago. This eyewitness testimony gives a clear indication unto why the coal carbon dates to only be a few thousand years old and why the coal is there in the first place.** 

**There is no reason to suggest that the Earth and the geologic column resulted after millions of years of age. This is because we have observed carbon 14 dates of a recent death, observable and testable science that coal can be formed rapidly under a single year, and on top of that, supported by an eyewitness account concludes that the coal in the geologic column of the Earth is a recent formation.**

Creation,eqfw6i,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Theistic Evolution: Science or Heresy?,"It is my observation that theistic evolution is the most common belief in America,  and i suspect, most of western civilization. It is an attempt to blend, or hybridize, the pop belief of abiogenesis and common ancestry,  with the inner, felt sense of a universe with a Higher Power.

But it only mixes bad science with bad theology, to arrive at a flawed view of reality.

There are many things you can conclude, if you assume God used abiogenesis and common ancestry to bring man into being:

**Theological**  
1. Man was not created as a complete being, with a soul. 
2. Death and suffering were the means God used, to 'create' man.  
3. Mankind is not equal, as there would be different levels of advancement among the evolving human tribes.  
4. The biblical account of man's creation and subsequent fall, bringing death into the world, is false.  
5. Morality is relative.. as man evolved, so did his instincts about morals. Early man could have brutal animal instincts, but they might change.  
6. God is fickle and changing.. there are no absolutes.  

**Social**
1. The more highly evolved, among the human collective, should manage and control the lower forms.  
2. Aspiring to evolve the Perfect Man is a logical step, in the evolution of man.  
3. Eliminating inferior stock is a necessary step, in any selective breeding process.  

*Scriptural conflicts with theistic evolution*: 

Acts17:24“The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; 26and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, 27that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; 28for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children.’

John1:1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not [a]comprehend it.

Genesis1:1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

Acts4:18So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. 20For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” 21So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done. 22For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed. 23And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. 24So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: **“Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them**..

Deut32:6Is this the way you repay the Lord,
you foolish and unwise people?
Is he not your Father, your Creator,
who made you and formed you?

Rom1:25They exchanged God’s truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator

Other logical problems with theistic evolution:  

1. If you premise an All Powerful Being, able to create a universe from nothing, why limit Him to naturalistic processes, that cannot even be established as valid scientific mechanisms?   Neither abiogenesis nor common descent has any scientific evidence.  They are conflicting RELIGIOUS beliefs, that have their root in atheistic naturalism. 

2. Attempting to 'spiritualize' the biblical creation account just emasculates it, as a historical event.   Dream and allegory render any biblical or historical event as meaningless and illusory. 

3. The prophets and biblical writers bore false witness, and were liars, relaying events that did not happen. 

Theistic evolution is a lame, irrational attempt to blend State sponsored Indoctrination of atheistic naturalism,  to the inner sense of God.  It tries to hybridize bad science with bad theology, and arrives at a useless, corrupt view of both.  It denies the Ability of God, and ignores the deception and duplicity of man.  It is a deadly poison, that leads people away from their Creator,  to a man made delusion.

Creation,eqfcup,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Speciation,"The primary condition for speciation is reproductive isolation. That is the main 'definition' of a species, that they do not reproduce with other different species. The horse has a genetic link to other horse descendants. These all indicate a narrowing of the genetic material.. a 'devolution' if you will. A donkey came from the same parent species as the horse &amp; zebra, but they are not able to reproduce viable offspring.. they CAN reproduce, but the progeny is sterile.. like the mule. But instead of this indicating an EXPANSION of trait availability, the facts are the exact opposite. It was a narrowing of the gene pool that isolated the horse, donkey, &amp; zebra. All of those animals descended from the same parent species.. we can trace that. But instead of opening up new traits of variability, they lost them. The zebra traits don't come up in donkeys anymore. And new 'species' are not being produced. What we see with the horse genetic line is a branching into a dead end. The variability is lost, as the progeny do not have the variety to pick from in their parent's dna.

You can explain the tree branches somewhat with descent. But you still don't have the mechanism that enables the leaps between the family/genus/species. As science, the 'amoeba to man' theory is full of holes, yet it is taught as though it is proven fact. The observable, repeatable FACTS are that breeding &amp; natural selection NARROW the genetic availability, until the species reaches equilibrium &amp; loses variability. That is why a brown rabbit is seldom (never?) born in the snowshoe rabbit species anymore. It is why chihuahuas do not produce an occasional wolf. That variability is lost, &amp; the breed is limited to the narrow band of variability. The very science of breeding is contrary to the premise of evolution: that new genetic material is constantly being produced &amp; increasing the complexity &amp; variability within a species. We observe the exact opposite. We repeat the exact opposite.

Even if some 'new' trait is discovered while breeding, now we know it was there.. hiding in the massive dna strands. It might take thousands or millions of generations for it to pop up, but when it does, this did not mean a new trait made itself, just that the hidden gene took a while to hit the jackpot. It is like pulling on a slot machine in vegas.. if you pull it enough times, eventually the sequence will come up that hits the combination you want. That is all breeding &amp; natural selection is, except they get to narrow the variability &amp; reduce the 'losing' combinations. Slot machines don't let you do that.

Why do species go extinct? Because they lose the variability needed to adapt to the changing environment. They don't create genes to survive if conditions change. If there is some variability already in them that increases their survival rate, then that trait will become more prominent. But if they don't have that trait, they die off. That is observable reality, not that species create new genetic information to adapt.

Modern genetics is one of the biggest enemies of the old 'theory' of evolution. Eventually, the facts will overwhelm the beliefs, &amp; the scientific establishment will come up with a new pop theory of origins. But they still are working this one for now. It is everywhere.. tv, national parks, museums, schools.. anywhere science is mentioned, evolution is tacked on, to prop it up as a belief. But real science does not support the theory. All of reality screams, 'NO!'

I'm sure there is more.  Individually,  each might be dismissed as an anomaly of human peculiarity.   But combined, they present a compelling conclusion of a Creator, for our origins and existence. 

So the next time you hear, '*There is no evidence for a Creator!!*', realize that is bluff and denial, not objective analysis of reality.",1,1579258097,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/epytun/evidence_for_the_creator_summary/
Creation,epyn45,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Philosophy of Origins,"I see 2 basic options for Origins:

*1. All matter &amp; life was created by an unknown being or beings: Intelligent Design.*  

*2. All matter &amp; life happened by accident, via unknown natural processes: Atheistic Naturalism.*  

Intelligent design includes creationism, alien seeding, &amp; any other theories that require the outside involvement of an intelligent being or beings. Atheistic Naturalism says that life started by natural processes, &amp; has evolved by other natural processes to the state we observe today., *without* a Creator.

Now, there are hybrid theories that combine the two. Some believe that intelligent design 'started' the process, &amp; natural processes have evolved life to where it is today. But there are still basically these 2 possibilities of our origins. And if you could prove the naturalistic view, there would be no need for any supernatural explanation, as the naturalistic one would suffice. And of course the flip side would also be true. If you could prove the existence of a being or beings who have the power to create a universe, any natural explanations would only be the methods they used.

We try to use science &amp; logic to decide which of these is the more likely, or what the evidence suggests, but nothing really works. Science cannot answer this. We cannot see or define any natural process that could have done it, so we are left ONLY with belief in either theory. Neither are subject to the scientific method.. they can't be repeated or observed. But neither has any provable evidence. Both theories are logically impossible. LIFE is impossible. The entire universe is impossible, yet here we are.

Of all the fundamental questions of life, Origins is the MOST BASIC of the questions, &amp; the answer to this one affects all the others.

IF we are here by atheistic naturalism:

1. There is no purpose to our existence. 'Why' is meaningless.  
2. There are no rules. Morality &amp; law are inventions of our own minds.  
3. There is no destiny. You die &amp; cease to exist. As you were for eternity past, so you will be for eternity future.  

IF we are here by Supernatural Design:

1. There might be a purpose. Why would such a Being do this?  
2. There might be rules, from the Creator's perspective. Perhaps there are consequences to our words &amp; deeds.  
3. There might be life after death. We may have souls, &amp; live beyond what we see here.  

As you can see, there are completely different answers to fundamental questions, depending on the answer to the very first one: *How?*  Wise men &amp; philosophers have spent millennia grappling with the possibilities, but humanity is at no more of a consensus than when we started.

That is why a person's view of Origins is the foundation upon which their entire world view is built upon. Most people are content to have a disjointed, hodge podge of irrational thought, faulty assumptions, and wrong answers to base their philosophy of life upon. But that is because the MOST BASIC QUESTION, our origins, is unknown by any of our natural senses. There are other factors: mental, emotional, or spiritual..  that are not part of our natural sensory perceptions that figure in. But from a scientific point of view, those are not subject to scientific scrutiny, &amp; do not count as empirical evidence.

There is no empirical answer to our origins. There are no natural laws, or scientific explanations that can even make a decent guess as to HOW we came about. We are here. But HOW we came about remains a mystery, unanswerable by human reason &amp; senses. If there is an answer to this question, reason &amp; science cannot answer it.  We can only fit the evidence into plausible models, to see if it works, logically. 

Unfortunately, the beliefs about origins are not clearly seen by many. Some believe that evolution &amp; natural processes are proven fact, &amp; that the naturalist theory is scientifically 'settled'. They will zealously &amp; dogmatically assert evolution as '*proven scientific fact!', when it is not even a good theory. Most of our public institutions support this unscientific concept, &amp; evolution is taught as fact in schools, national parks, nature shows, &amp; practically all human institutions. It is the status quo of origins, but like others before, it should be scrutinized &amp; submit to the scientific method.  Critical thinking,  skepticism, and Questioning Authority are the best tools for discovery.",0,1579256722,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/epyn45/philosophy_of_origins/

I have a bit of a different take, but this is actually the same method i used to grasp a better understanding of god. However you don't start with the qualities about the creator. First you must set up what the observations we have of the world in general mean pertaining to such an idea.

1. **All things in nature are complex**, highly ordered, and generally beautiful. The universe carries set laws of nature, mathematics, logic, etc.

2. **The world is running down**, falling apart, degrading, corrupted, full of evil. And also from a more modern perspective generally building up towards some grand historical event, maybe a world war, which may end up ending all of humanity. 

3. **All men are inherently flawed**, yet have an innate sense of moral law we use to judge good and evil which carries even to the most secluded peoples.

4. **All living things die**, and there is a unique difference between a living and dead body not only relating to bodily functions.

5. **Another kind of reality exists.** Every culture that has ever existed has carried stories of supernatural, otherworldly, and the mystical to an extent that at least some of it must be based in reality. Dreams are another kind of alternate reality.

6. **Belief is powerful**, a driving force throughout history, and motivation and depression, medical shock, charismatic leaders and placebo effects testify to this

7. **Relationships are important and necessary**, not only between living things but all of creation relies in some part on another, from animal and human ecosystems, star and planet formations, chemical bonds; nothing is ever still and nothing is ever alone.

8. **Humans are special beyond all of creation**, with language, sentient consciousness, technology, philosophy, etc.

9. **There are limits to everything in existence**, and trying to go past the limits we have in place will only hurt us, whether it be excessive eating, excessive lying, etc.

10. **All things come from something of higher complexity**. You can't get something from nothing.

Just from these 10 principles, you can understand God as Christianity does.  
From all of this, you can first understand that we come from something more complex than ourselves, which since we are limited in nature must go past that, and is supernatural in nature. This kind of ""Creator-force"" as you can call it at this state, if it is unlimited and supernatural, must be outside of the universe. 
This creator force just by making us, especially since we are clearly above creation, has a kind of relationship with us, and since this creator is unlimited, so are all of its qualities. An infinite relationship means infinite love, goodness, truth, justice, and all of the traditional concepts of god. This creator force, being infinite, cannot be divided or immuted, and mustn't carry an infinitely regressing chain of creators. There is but one, and thus God is the better term at this state of thinking.

Now, if this idea of god were to just have love, goodness, truth, etc. as external and created concepts, this would mean that he didn't have them before the universe, meaning he wouldn't have made us in the first place. So what this means is that God must be the very concept, essence, and being of love, truth, and goodness. Every time love or truth is present, it is a reflection of god, which is another way of saying we are in his image.  

Since there is an objective moral law we all understand, there must be punishment for that law. But as God is the essence of Good, then God doesn't seem to just be writing a law to judge us with, but rather he *is* the law. We are not judged in the sense of a courtroom, but rather we are judged in whether we choose to adhere to god or not - he dwells in our hearts and we can choose to set up the temple for him or not. As God is pure love, truth, and goodness, then that would mean that where he is not is hate, lies, and evil. Essentially, the obverse of god is hell. So this means that people are not tortured by a judge, jury, and executioner god, but rather we choose to alienate the thing which is pure love and happiness and in doing so he lovingly lets us go to the one place where by definition he is not - hell. We doom ourselves in selfish pride.

Now knowing all things will die, this seems to be a dividing line between now and the next reality. Belief and relationships carry an importance and power that extends beyond, since god as infinite relationship and love is living within us, we can use faith and love of our own making in order to open ourselves more to him. In a sense, by imitating god, we can become ""gods"" of our own, somewhat like a father and son relationship. We are able to grasp the infinite even from our finite place. In this, we can realize that, especially just to create us, God must have knowledge, thought, and being, and thus all of these infinite. More than love, God is *life*.

Now thinking back, if God is the essence of love, whom did he love before anything was ever made? And if God is outside of creation how can he be within us? The answer now becomes one that goes beyond this kind of logic, as we must look to the gospel which explains it. Before creating anything, god was able to love because he was of trinitarian nature, and he lives within us because he is at once outside of creation, and yet everywhere and fillest all things. Now we know god is all loving, all knowing, and the essence of life itself, and yet all men die. God is all good, yet men and the world are corrupted in evil. We are limited in nature, and unable to fix ourselves, and so must rely on god for everything - He is the life we live, the love we have, the air we breathe. But that is not even enough, and so in Jesus Christ men no longer die, and no longer must be addicted and entangled in evil. Jesus not only fulfills these aspects of God, but fixes the paradox of a divinely ruling God, and yet since he is good, a humble God. 

Many ""paradoxes"" exist of god which are really just misunderstandings. Two of these are fate v.s. free will, and Good works v.s. Faith. If God is sovereign, then we are fated to heaven or hell, and yet this becomes robotic. If we are only able to choose whether to accept Gods love, then it diminishes Gods role. The answer is that we work together with God as two wills become one, like a fork in the road with a guide telling us which path to the village, we could still always go the other way and become lost. But if we trust the guide we were not forced and yet did not do so entirely of our own will. Now Good works are said to be like filthy rags in Gods eyes, and not even the devil is saved by faith, yet both of these are said to save us. There is yet a balance inbetween, which is love. These two paradoxes have especially confused many christians, but it does not disprove at all the notion of God, for every supposed paradox is just a testament to the infinite complexity which God is.

Creation,empetb,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,What is The Creator Like?,"Inspired by the Blind Men and the Elephant poem that i referred to yesterday, i thought a thread where we relate OUR perceptions of The Creator might be of interest.

This is a PERCEPTUAL and scientific examination, not a query for religious dogma.  We observe the material world.  We interact with it.  What can we conclude about the Creator from these observations?

This is a logical companion to belief in creationism. We see the physical evidence,  and conclude, 'Creator!'  So what does the physical evidence tell us about this Creator?

I'll start.

1. The Creator is hidden and mysterious.  We are unable to perceive God with our physical senses. He is obscured from us for some reason, and even our spiritual perceptors seem fuzzy or broken  altogether.  We see the evidence of His Existence,  and the results of His creative power, but we cannot see Him.

2. The Creator is infinite. To create an infinite universe, The Creator would have to be infinite, Himself.

Independent of the Bible, the physical evidence we have in hand combined with accepted laws of physics and chemistry strongly suggests the Fossil Record is much younger than millions of years old.  However, based on accepted science and data we do not yet have a convincing empirical and theoretical case that universe is young.  There are serious anomalies with the Big Bang, so much so that variable speed of light theories have become fashionable!  The mainstream will invoke variable speed of light to save a failing theory (like the Big Bang), but then they'll claim variable speed of light is crank science if YEC/YCC (Young Cosmos Creationists) invoke variable speed of light.  Ah, the hypocrisy!  Nevertheless, I wouldn't say we have a slam dunk case in terms of evidence outside the Bible that the universe is young.

Anyway, I teach Creationism and Apologetics in a mega church where there are YECs, OECs, and Theistic Darwinists.  I don't think Christian brothers who are members should be expelled or treated as if they were wife-beaters or heretics for having a different view of Genesis.  That is also the church policy, and the most senior pastors of the church have historically been YECs.

We could totally avoid discussion the issue in church, which I think would be worse than not talking about it all!  Having a discussion, a debate, even a public disagreement is far better than pretending there aren't sharp disagreements over the issue of origins.  I'd rather have non-unity over the issue in the church and have open and visible debates and discussion where the youth can hear all sides of the case, rather than letting the youth hear ONLY the Darwinist or Old Earth side when they go to university.

With that said, I'd like to thank Marek and Cody for a civil discussion about viewpoints which we have strong disagreement over.  As I do in my church, if someone professes Jesus as Lord and Savior, I treat them as brothers.

Creation,embdx1,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,"The Blind Men and the Elephant, revisited","*THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT*
John Godfrey Saxe

IT was six men of Indostan. 
To learning much inclined,  
Who went to see the Elephant. 
(Though all of them were blind),  
That each by observation. 
Might satisfy his mind.  

The First approached the Elephant,  
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me!—but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried: ""Ho!—what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 't is mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out his eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'T is clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: ""E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!

So, oft in theologic wars
The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
Not one of them has seen!

This is a wonderful poem, imo, that only needs a slight update for the modern religious climate.

There were actually 7 blind men, not 6. His perceptions were left out, by Mr. Saxe, but that was just a cultural oversight, i am sure. I will add the 7th man, to make the poem more contemporary and relevant.

*The last, extending empty hands, 
Disdainfully, he hissed,  
'You fools!', said he, 'it's obvious,  
Your brains are in a twist!

Creation,em8vr5,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Personal Experience,"Millions of people, over the millennia,  have claimed some kind of metaphysical experience or contact with a spiritual dimension. Many call this 'God', with dogmatic assurance.

Due to the perceptive abilities of humans, and their propensity for MISperception, these descriptions and/or experiences do not always align.  But 'something' or 'Someone', happened to these people.  There are too many instances,  over thousands of years,  spanning all regions, cultures, and race, to dismiss all of them as 'wishful thinking', or delusion.

The old Hindu parable, about the blind men and the elephant is a word picture of human (mis!)perceptions.

But let us examine the arguments that wishful thinking, delusion, or fear are the 'real reasons!' that people believe in The Creator. 

**Belief in The Creator:**  

*Wishful Thinking*  
This life can be hard.  No argument there. Some, wishing to avoid the emptiness, difficulty, and purposelessness of their existence might fabricate an afterlife, where the streets are paved with gold, and where milk and honey flows freely.  

*Delusion* 
Human beings are manipulators.  Some find pleasure and/or monetary gain by manipulating others with fantastic tales. Fearful, lost, confused, and bewildered people are easily taken in by the smooth talking manipulations of these charlatans.  

*Fear*  
Unable to cope with the reality of a purely material universe,  with no purpose or meaning, some (most?) people are driven by fear to believe in a Creator and an afterlife.  

These are common arguments why people choose to believe in God, and any personal evidence/experience is dismissed as a delusion. But if these are valid arguments as to 'why?' people believe 'IN GOD', can they not also be be reasons to believe IN atheistic naturalism? 

**Belief in godless naturalism:**  

*Wishful Thinking*  
Unwilling to face the prospect of accountability to their Creator, and the possibility of an afterlife and/or soul, some people fabricate a godless universe,  where there are no consequences to our thoughts,  words, or actions.  

*Delusion*  
These same human manipulators can deceive with an ideological agenda of godless naturalism,  for the same control/monetary gain motivations.

*Fear*  
Terrified of the prospect of an omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipresent Creator, and the possibility of consequences for our thoughts, words, and actions, humans concoct fantastic imaginations to escape the dread and angst that broods in their innermost being.  Atheistic naturalism is one such fantasy.

So any arguments as to why a person might believe in The Creator can apply to belief in atheistic naturalism as well..  perhaps more so.  Many of the believers in God have claimed a personal experience with the supernatural.. something that believers in atheistic naturalism cannot claim.  They have personal skepticism and dismissal of other's experiences ONLY. 

The obvious, observable reality that millions of people, over thousands of years, have claimed to experience 'something' supernatural, is evidence for that reality.  Taken together with all the other evidence, a conclusion of a Creator is compelling..  overwhelming, really.",5,1578572433,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/em8vr5/evidence_for_the_creator_personal_experience/

The stats 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22572/
Kinesin hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of approximately 80 molecules per second. Thus, given the step size of 80 Å per molecule of ATP, kinesin moves along a microtubule at a speed of 6400 Å per second. This rate is considerably slower than the maximum rate for myosin, which moves relative to actin at 80,000 Å per second. Recall, however, that myosin movement depends on the independent action of hundreds of different head domains working along the same actin filament, whereas the movement of kinesin is driven by the processive action of kinesin head groups working in pairs. Muscle myosin operates to maximize the speed of the motion, whereas kinesin functions to achieve steady, but slower, transport in one direction along a filament.""

Myosin

These data suggest that kinesin has an organization very similar to that of myosin even though there are no obvious sequence similarities between the two molecules.

""Kinesin and Myosin are motor proteins. Motor proteins are molecular motors that move on the surface of a suitable substrate. The image can be likened to a train moving over a railway track except that Kinesin and Myosin are two different trains requiring two different types of tracks. The movement of these motor molecules is powered by the breakdown of the universal energy molecule called as ATP.

It was noted by the author of the first paper that there were blatantly obvious similarities between the two systems of transportation,  even though there were no sequence suggestive similarities..

The prevailing trend in current models of early eukaryotic cell evolution is the proposal of stepwise acquisition of cellular complexity with particular extant eukaryotic lineages being identified as derived from intermediary and primitive phases of early eukaryotic evolution (reviewed in [1]). This idea is contradicted by the results presented here, which demonstrate that, at least for the kinesin-driven cytoskeleton, the LCEA 
(The mythical Last Universal Eukaryotic Ancestor)
already possessed a highly complex cellular form before giving rise to any of the sampled extant eukaryotic groups. This proto-eukaryotic cell was surprisingly highly developed in terms of kinesin motor types - containing the majority of families now found in eukaryotes.""

""the history of kinesins is in many cases a history of paralog loss from an ancestral form which possessed a motor repertoire more complex than many extant organisms.""

Creation,elspqh,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,The apostle Paul disavows death before sin (Old earth Christian views refuted simply),"One of the central tenets of old-earth Christian theists (progressive creationists &amp; theistic evolutionists) is the belief that when the Bible teaches that ""the wages of sin is death"", it is referring **only** to spiritual death, not physical death. People holding these views must interpret all references to death being the result of sin in this fashion: spiritual, not physical. They must hold that physical death is an integral and original part of God's creation.  


Nobody in the church, as far as I know, held to this view prior to the modern era when old earth views became prevalent in secular academic circles. In this way, it looks very much as if it were a reactionary response to these ideas ( a compromise ), rather than anything organic that flows from the natural interpretation of Scripture itself. **This alone is not sufficient to refute the idea**, but it certainly is a giant red flag. One would think that God would empower the church, filled with the Holy Spirit, to rightly interpret His word in this fundamental area without the help of scoffers from outside the church like Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, et al. One would not expect such a drastic reversal in doctrine to come about only thousands of years later, if indeed this is what the Bible has taught all along!  


But we need not rely exclusively on such a weak inductive argument, because the Bible outright refutes the idea that spiritual death is what is referred to when Adam sinned. How do we know?   


The apostle Paul outright states in Romans 8:10:  


"" But if Christ is in you, **although the body is dead because of sin**, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. ""  


All throughout the book of Romans Paul explains in various ways that death is a result of sin. In an earlier place, Paul wrote:  


"" Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned— ""  


Old earthers try to explain this away by saying that this refers only to spiritual ""death"" (separation from God), not to the death of the body. But if that's the case, why did Christ need to come and die physically? It makes no sense. The whole reason Christ came was to ""fulfill the righteous requirement of the Law"". The Bible says ""the wages of sin is death"". If that refers to spiritual death only, then Jesus Christ died for no reason on the physical Cross.  


But Paul makes it clear beyond all question in Romans 8:10. The BODY IS DEAD BECAUSE OF SIN. Old Earth Christians: adjust your views to be in line with clear Biblical teaching.

Creation,elrqwy,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Extinction,"Extinction is evidence of The Creator.

The wide diversity within each family/type/clade/kind reflects the parent stock being full, and then slowly losing diversity, via genomic entropy. 

Felidae,  for example, HAD much more diversity in the past, and the big cats are dwindling and going extinct, not increasing in diversity and traits, like common ancestry predicts.

https://m.ranker.com/list/list-of-extinct-big-cats/ranker-science

*One of the biggest concerns conservationists have these days is the ever-decreasing population of big cats across the planet. Their concerns are certainly warranted as a large number of big cats have gone extinct since the animals first began appearing some two million years ago. While most people are familiar with the likes of the famed sabre-toothed cats, there are recent examples of tigers, the Barbary lion, and other familiar animals that have disappeared in the 20th century.

Starting with the most recently extinct animals, this list of extinct big cats includes many that went extinct thousands of years ago, but there are a few examples of animals that disappeared in the 1900s. Protecting the remaining lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, and others is imperative if we want to keep lists like this one of extinct cats as short as possible.*

**Observation:**

The variability within the felidae family has decreased, and there are fewer traits in that family than in times past.  Many cat varieties have gone extinct, in the last 200 years, and more before that.

**Prediction of Models:**

*Creationism:*  
The ancestral felid contained all the variability, from current and extinct cats. Over time, traits can be lost, as isolation and adaptation 'selects' the winners and losers.

*Common Ancestry:*  
The ancestral felid would be simpler, with fewer traits, and would have increased in complexity and variability over time.

The prediction of increasing complexity, added traits, and wider diversity is not observed.  There is no mechanism to do this and it has never been observed.  It is a belief that scientific observation does not support.

There was MORE diversity in times past, than now.  Felidae is DEVOLVING, not adding traits and increasing in complexity. We observe genetic entropy and extinction, for organisms that do not have the traits to adapt to environmental conditions. 

The observable reality of MORE diversity in the various families, devolving over time..  at times to extinction..  is evidence of a creation event, and conflicts with the belief in common ancestry.",5,1578484470,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/elrqwy/evidence_for_the_creator_extinction/
Creation,elkf9b,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Two logical issues with evolution ...,"_Here are two things that I just thought about vis-a-vis evolution.  In the past I'd post in /debateevolution, but I find it overly hostile , so now I post  there less and  here more._

First, in terms of evolution and adaptation, I don't see how evolution can create **stable complex ecosystems.** Consider the interactions between zebra, impala, lion (assuming that the lion likes to eat the other two). There is a huge environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion. Now we've all seen evolution do amazing things, like evolve hearts and lungs, so making an impala be fast enough (or skillful enough) to avoid capture should not be too hard. Now the lion can also evolve. It loves to eat zebra which are not particularly fast. Again, it wouldn't take much, compared to the convergent evolution of echolocation, for evolution to make the lion slightly better at catching zebra. So the lions then eats all the zebra. All zebra are now gone. It can't catch the implala so then it starves. All lion are now gone. All we have are impala.  The point of this is that it's very easy for minor changes to disrupt complex ecosystems and result in very simple ones. Evolution would tend to create simple ecosystems, not the complex ones that we see now. They are more likely to be created by an intelligence that works out everything to be in balance - with a number of negative feedback stabilization loops too.

Secondly, this [post] led me to consider DNA's error checking and repair mechanisms. How is it, that evolution which depends on random mutations, would evolve mechanisms that try to prevent any mutations from occuring at all? The theory of evolution cannot exist without mutations driving change, so why and how would random mutations end up creating complex nanomachines that try to eliminate all mutations. This doesn't make sense to me.

Creation,ela3xw,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Ideological consequences of Origins Belief,"I have been criticised (on reddit? Say it ain't so!), for examining the *consequential, ideological* implication for belief in common ancestry.  I will provide my reasons for examining the historical, ideological, and political *consequences* for belief in origins, and show how it is NOT a tangential, off topic deflection, but is foundational to other beliefs and conclusions that affect all of humanity. 

Origins is the spearhead, that drives and compels subsequent beliefs. 

If the moderators think those kinds of analyses are inappropriate here, i will honor their decision.

1. Beliefs/ideology do not appear in a vacuum. There are streams of thought that can be traced, in the human experience,  that reveal the sources and implications of foundational beliefs. 
2. Origins is THE FOUNDATIONAL BELIEF for almost everything else.  It reflects a core opinion about the nature of the universe.  **Morality, equality, natural Law**, and other critical beliefs that affect the human animal DIRECTLY, find their basis in the belief in origins. 
3. Interrelated, correlated ideological beliefs can be parsed for individual examination,  but the correlations can also be analyzed for their consequence and significance to human ideology AND their implications. 
4. To pretend origins is just about a dry scientific theory is to miss the ideological war that has been raging for millennia. Darwinism is just a recent (in the timeline of human history) expression of that battle for the soul.

One example, then i will abide by the mod's decision.

**Joseph Stalin** was one of the most significant historical figures in the 20th century. He was instrumental in defeating Hitler, and expanded the influence of communism in his time. Here are some facts about Joseph Stalin:
1. He began as a student in a theological seminary.
2. He became an atheist after reading Origin of Species, by Darwin.
3. He became a devoted communist, and was inspired by Marx.
4. He was responsible for 20 - 25 million deaths, during his reign.
5. He engaged in armed robbery, to support the Bolshevik cause.
6. He impregnated a 13 yr old girl, while exiled in Siberia, c. 1914.

It is impossible to ignore the connection between Stalin's actions, and the core ideology that drove him. Much of the genocide that drove Stalin was to help 'create' the New Soviet Man.. a highly evolved superhuman, much like Hitler's goal for the Aryan nation.

In 1940, a book was published in Moscow entitled “Landmarks in the Life of Stalin.” In it we read:

'*At a very early age, while still a pupil in the ecclesiastical school, Comrade Stalin developed a critical mind and revolutionary sentiments. He began to read Darwin and became an atheist.  G. Glurdjidze, a boyhood friend of Stalin’s, relates:  
“I began to speak of God. Joseph heard me out, and after a moment’s silence, said:  
“‘You know, they are fooling us, there is no God. …’“

I was astonished at these words. I had never heard anything like it before.“‘How can you say such things, Soso?’ I exclaimed.

“‘I’ll lend you a book to read; it will show you that the world and all living things are quite different from what you imagine, and all this talk about God is sheer nonsense,’ Joseph said.

“‘What book is that?’ I enquired.

“‘Darwin. You must read it,’ Joseph impressed on me.”

Another quote, from a contemporary Russian:
Seventy years ago communists easily (and, as it turned out, for a long time) seized power in Russia. Without hesitation they undertook to build a new society, hitherto unprecedented in the history of mankind, and announced the construction of Communism throughout the whole world to be their final goal.
In this society there was to be no private property, it was to be a-religious: denying God, denying the existence of the immortal soul and recognizing only the material aspect of life as real. The society was to be free of ethnic affiliations, and communists were to have unlimited power over that society.
Unprecedented methods were used to build this unprecedented society. It was decided to create a new man. This man was to be free from ethnic affiliations, see no sense in private property, be always ready to sacrifice himself for the benefit of society, have no doubts that he originated from an ape or something like it (certainly from a beast) and that nothing will remain of him after his death. In other words, he was to be a one-hundred percent materialist and atheist and must know that the meaning of life is in the person's usefulness to society and the supreme goal is in a better, wealthy and happy life of future generations. Recognizing this, he would necessarily be happy.
It was obvious to initiators of the new society and creators of the new man that several existing classes of people would delay the implementation of this task. So, it was decided to destroy millions of these people ""as a class ,"" i.e., to kill them. To ""destroy as a class"" is not just a reckless cynical phrase; in fact, it is a guide to practical action. This was done in Russia, and in this way began construction of the new society in every country as soon as the communists seized power*. ~Sergei Khodorovich, 1987

The New Man, as a goal of the controlling elite, is widely referenced in the writings of the Marx/Darwin based ideologies.  Most of the notable despots in the 20th century were driven to help evolution create a New Man. Pol pot, Mao, Chavez, Stalin, Hitler, and almost all Marxist based ideologies included the Darwinist theme of favoring desired traits, and breeding.. helping evolution.. breed a New Man.

Maybe the consequences of that ideology did not affect some, but it did affect millions of others.  It would be naive to think that amoral naturalism has no consequence or influence on the socio/political sphere of the human experience.   On the contrary,  it is the foundation for those influences .",4,1578394879,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ela3xw/ideological_consequences_of_origins_belief/

**Though Experiments:**

Suppose that God does not exist, and you know that God does not exist.  Given the evidence in biology, geology, etc. is all the same, would you conclude that barimonolgy, universal common descent, or a third option is the best account of evolutionary relationships?

Suppose that you have a strong belief that God does not exist, regardless of the fact-of-the-matter.  Would you conclude that barimonolgy, universal common descent, or a third option is the best account of evolutionary relationships?  If a third option, is barimonology or universal common descent more likely just comparing those two?  

Suppose that you suspend judgement on the existence of God, and will suspend judgement regardless of your prefered phylogeny.

So far the findings have been unusual - all the major sites I have looked at are a mixture of continental, freshwater and marine life.  This is unusual because I expected to find this only with fossils from near the Cretaceous Tertiary boundary (ie the point close to the part where dinosaurs died out) however, they seem to be everywhere in all fossil sites. 

The biggest problem I've run into was citation.  Wikipeida has a listing of all the fossils that were found in the major fossil sites, but, while Wikipedia is a great starting point for research, I don't think I could get away with using Wikipedia as a source.  Epically when writing something that most people won't want to believe.  Sci-hub has been a lifesaver in this regard - so I guess I'm officially  pirate now.   

I wanted feedback on exactly what information I should include in these papers so far I decided on the following: 

1. Geologic era (all sites are from the cretaceous but recording what part of the cretaceous)
2. Geographic location (to check proximity to the Mexico meteor which is said to have killed the dinosaurs)
3. Freshwater and saltwater fossils found 
4. continental fossils found 

Any tips of other information I should be looking at that would be useful?  

Further what's the best way to organize this information?  I was thinking of creating a database that way it would be easy to have the computer compile everything and quickly analyze the data. I was thinking of python classes, something along the lines of 

```

class fossil_site:
  def __init__(self, name, era, mixed)
    self.name = name
    self.era = era
    self.mixed = Value
    self.water_exist = value 
    self.marine_exist =Value
    self.freshwater_exist = Value
    self.constinental_exist =Value
    self.marine = []
    self.freshwater = []
    self.unkn_water = []
    self.continental = []
  def __bool__(self)
    return self.mixed != 0  
    self.water_exist = != 0  
    self.marine_exist = != 0  
    self.freshwater_exist = != 0  
    self.constinental_exist = != 0  

```

The values would have to include the names and a citation - so I guess it would have to be a list of tuples, which is already getting pretty complicated.  Anyone have any suggestions for an easier way to compile this information in a way that can be easily retrieved and compared?


Also is anyone interested in helping given that looking through 110 fossil sites is going to take a while, if you're interested, le me know and I'll pass along the list of fossil sites and we can work in tandem using GitHub or something",2,1578372824,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/el6l4b/dinosaur_marine_overlap_self_study_request_for/
Creation,el3e7p,onecowstampede,,t2_2wnbytl0,self.Creation,,DNA,"The information 

DNA is a string of four different subunits linked together chemically. Cellular DNA actually exists as two strands that run in opposite directions and then twist together, as if twisting a ladder around a central pole. These four subunits are usually abbreviated by the first letter of their chemical name, so just use A, G, C, and T.
DNA molecules can link together literally millions of these subunits. But in cellular DNA these strings of subunits do not exist in isolation. They are paired together with subunits of the other string, because DNA is double-stranded. An A always pairs with a T and a G always pairs with a C. So if you know the sequence of one strand, you will know the sequence of the other strand.
On top of all that, each “letter” of the code is like a letter of the English alphabet. The English alphabet uses twenty-six letters to make limitless words. A word can be made up of as few as one letter or as many as over a dozen letters. But in the genetic code, these chemical letters A, G, C, and T are grouped into “words” made up of only three letters. These three-letter words are referred to as codons. Sixty-one of the sixty-four possible three-letter codons code for one of the twenty amino acids found in living cells. The other three codons are “stop” messages.
This means that the sequence of the DNA letters determines the amino acid sequence of proteins. The sequence of amino acids in proteins is largely responsible for the three-dimensional shape of the protein, which determines its function in great part. So, encoded in the sequence of DNA molecules are the digital instructions to code for proteins, the workhorses of any cell. 
[The molecular machines functioning on the energy generated by ATP]
We use letters to form words like DNA uses nucleotide subunits to form codons. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid. We use words to compose sentences. The sequence of codons forms a gene, and the sequence of amino acids forms proteins. We use sentences to form paragraphs, which are then grouped into articles or chapters of a book. Groups of genes and other DNA elements form chromosomes. When books and magazines are brought together, we call this a library. When chromosomes are assembled into the nucleus of a cell, we call this a genome.
You could represent the parallels in the following table:
Letters=NucleotidesWords=Codons (amino acids)Sentences=Genes (proteins)Books=ChromosomesLibrary=Genome
What I’m trying to demonstrate is that the genetic code is a language. We use linguistic words to describe what happens to DNA. DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is like a dialect of DNA. The mRNA is then translated into protein, a totally different language.
This is not just a clever use of analogous terms. These linguistic terms accurately describe what is actually happening. The genetic code is an informational code or a language;  in digital form.

But its not just information,  not just code, not  just sequence.

Neat, right?

So what is the supposed evolutionary relationship of the ATPsynthase..
How is this one spun as evidence for common descent?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154653/
""we mapped the distribution of nine bioenergetic modes on a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences from 272 species representing the full diversity of prokaryotic lineages. This highlights the patchy distribution of many pathways across different lineages, and suggests either up to 26 independent origins or 17 horizontal gene transfer events""

I would consider all of those potentials, saltational events. 
(Pronounced mir•a•cle mĭr′ə-kəl)
*ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)
Y'know..Indistinguishable from a thanos finger snap..

But, for the sake of argument,  consider the 17 horizontal gene transfers

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2531898?dopt=Abstract
Note the repeat:
""it was not possible to derive the exact evolutionary relationship among the primary kingdoms..""

They then go on to say that if ( 17 of)  these events did happen ""x"" would be the likely order... assuming common descent as a premise...

But what is horizontal gene transfer? Has it ever been directly observed or is its essence only inferred  to try and justify why identical sequences (identical molecular structures) are found everywhere throughout the domains of life..
Wiki has this to say..

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer_in_evolution

""HGT happens very infrequently – at the individual organism level, it is highly improbable for any such event to take place. However, on the grander scale of evolutionary history, these events occur with some regularity.""

*Facepalm*

 ""On one hand, this forces biologists *to abandon the use of individual genes as good markers for the history of life*. ..
(Italicized Emphasis mine)
On the other hand, this provides an almost unexploited large source of information about the past...""

Wait. Wut???? 
Did we just stumble on the biological equivalent of dark matter? How is it both the evidence for common descent and the nullification of phylogenetic inference? 

Magic thinking, perhaps? Or is the phrase mental gymnastics more apt.. 

I'll stop here,  for now.

Creation,eke27m,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Phony Science!,"Here are a few of the Fake Science Beliefs of the day:  
1. **Global Warming**. This is actually the poster child for Fake Science. It meets all the criteria: agenda driven, ridicule for any critics, ad hominem, contrived data, mandated belief, &amp; relentless indoctrination.  
2. **A woman can do what she pleases with her body**. This ignores the scientific evidence of a unique, individual human being growing inside the woman, which is the mammalian way of reproduction. The new person is no longer 'a part of the woman's body', but a new life, growing inside her. It is fake science to claim it is a 'blob of tissue', or other euphemisms.  
3. **Common Ancestry is settled science, &amp; is proven to be the origin of man!** This is flawed in every way, &amp; is also Fake Science. There is NO evidence that this is even possible, much less that it DID happen. It is merely an indoctrinated belief.  
4. **Guns kill people**! Statistics are given, from juggled data sets, &amp; deceptive studies, to try to demonize the firearm, which is also a great deterrent for evildoers. But only the negatives are presented, to try to promote a false perception, &amp; to promote a phony narrative.  
5. **White people are evil**! The race obsessed, divisive left is constantly revising history, promoting false narratives of 'white privilege,' 'black lives matter', &amp; other hysteria based racist memes. It is not supported by facts or reality, but is a phony narrative, used to instigate violence, sedition, &amp; division in society.  
6. **A nation should have open borders**. This is historically &amp; logistically false &amp; impossible. A nation that has any attraction to immigration must have some kind of orderly system for immigrants. Open borders only create chaos, crime, &amp; overload the system. The reasoning &amp; arguments for it are completely irrational, fallacious, &amp; based on deceptive data.  
7. **Need money?  Print some!** This is the absurd belief that monetary policy should be based on decree, rather than production. But all fiat money does is devalue, as inflation eats up the wealth of the working man, &amp; transfers it to the ruling elite.  
8. **Govt can enable everyone to live off of everybody else**! This is the 'Great Fiction' that Bastiat wrote of, &amp; ignores the more basic problems of production of food &amp; other necessities, which 'govt' cannot produce. Only working people create the necessities of life.  
9. **America is evil**!  :O .. America is the only successful experiment in self rule, in the history of man. Those who hate it as a system usually suggest some kind of marxist, collectivist solution, which has a terrible record for the common man, of rights, opportunity, prosperity, or anything else.  
10. **Choose your Identity!**  This ignores scientific reality. It pretends that biological reality is somehow a choice, or an option you can make at any time in your life. But it ignores the genetic &amp; biological reality of gender, species, age, or traits.  
11. **Love Trumps Hate**. This is a favorite slogan of the progressive left, which they demonstrate by rioting, burning cars, &amp; committing acts of violence on those who disagree with them. It is merely Orwellian 'New speak', which redefines reality with opposite terms.  
12. **Islam is the religion of peace**. This is also demonstrated, almost daily, with suicide bombers, attacks on civilians, &amp; terrorist attacks, with the left constantly defending them while attacking other beliefs as 'bigoted'.  

It is a juggernaut of cultural change, brought on by the progressive religion, with their roots in Marxist and Darwinist principles, and promoted exclusively by the left wing propaganda machine. It is accelerating, and I do not believe that a dwindling, dying breed of traditional Americans, can stop it.

In my lifetime i have witnessed this cultural transformation in many areas:

1. Drugs are cool. Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  
2. Free love. AKA, sexual immorality. Inconsequential sex, for fun, with no repercussions. To enable that, we need:  
3. Abortion on demand. Kill the baby, so you can live the dream of inconsequential sex.  
4. Normalize homosexuality. Like many other values in America, this went from being despised, aberrant behavior to hip and trendy.  
5. Militant greenies. 'Save Mother Earth from the evil capitalists!' ..and to do that:  
6. Socialism is cool! A Marxist, collectivist utopia would solve everything!  

Before I was born, the anti Creator movement was already underway. I was indoctrinated into atheistic naturalism, which is at the core of progressivism. 

**It was the amoral basis of atheistic naturalism that opened the pandora's box for all the other 'transformation!' changes**.

Why, in a nation allegedly dedicated to NON ESTABLISHMENT  of religion, would the institutions of govt dedicate themselves to exclusive Indoctrination of a religio/philosophical belief?

For decades, the courts and legislatures have worked tirelessly to ban any suggestion of a Creator,  and promote EXCLUSIVELY,  the belief in atheistic naturalism. State run schools,  aka, Indoctrination centers, ban any mention of a Creator,  except as fodder for ridicule and mocking.  Only atheistic naturalism,  and their core beliefs, are taught and presented as 'settled science!', until the hapless indoctrinees nod like bobbleheads, and bow in humble obeisance to the decrees of the High Priests of Atheism

*The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions*.  ~Noam Chomsky

A fascinating historical study is the progressive hijacking of the judicial and legislative branches to mandate their agenda, and to censor any opposition.

The teaching of universal common  ancestry is one such example.

At the turn of the 19th century, progressivism was taking off, as an ideological worldview. The theory of universal common descent was an integral part of this worldview, and provided the naturalistic basis needed.

Dewey, Wilson, Sanger, Roosevelt, and many other progressives sought to bring the superstitious, backward nation into the 20th century, where their goal of a collectivist utopia could be realized. Marx and Darwin were constantly referenced, by the early progressives.

But the Christian convictions were strong, in middle America, and they could not get their agenda of exclusive control of religious/philosophical concepts in those areas. The cities and coasts were easy, and progressive ideology became the standard in academia.

Most laws, regarding topics of educational instruction, were minimal.. It was left to locales to set curriculum, and religious instruction was common. Prayers were often offered to God, and biblical themes were commonly taught.

Note the following judicial timeline.  It clearly shows the slow transition from a God centered, traditional American values ideology, into a naturalistic one, where any alternate expressions of philosophical belief are banned. ..under the guise of 'science!'

*1925- the state of Tennessee passes a law banning the teaching of evolution in public school. It went to court, in what has been called the 'Scopes monkey trial'. Many other states followed suit, banning the teaching of evolution. The tennessee law was upheld initially.

1967 – Tennessee repeals the Butler Act, the law that banned the teaching of evolution in public schools.

1968 – In Epperson v. Arkansas, the Supreme Court strikes down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.

1973 – Tennessee passes a law requiring that public schools give equal emphasis to ""the Genesis account in the Bible"" along with other theories about the origins of man.  The 'Equal Time' law.

1975 – Tennessee's ""equal time"" law is declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.

1982 — In McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, a U.S. district judge strikes down an Arkansas law that required public schools to give ""balanced treatment"" to evolution and creationism whenever either was taught.

1987 – In Edwards v. Aguillard, the Supreme Court rules that a Louisiana law requiring public schools to give ""balanced treatment"" to creationism and evolution is unconstitutional.

1990 - In Webster v. New Lenox School District, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that a school district may prohibit a teacher from teaching creation science.

1994, in Peloza v. Capistrano School District, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court finding that a teacher's First Amendment right to free exercise of religion is not violated by a school district's requirement that evolution be taught in biology classes.

2005 - in Selman et al. v. Cobb County School District et al., U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled that a evolution warning label required in Cobb County textbooks violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The disclaimer stickers stated, ""This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.""*

Notice the dates. In 1925, the pinnacle of the progressive movement, they used the courts to demand an equal voice for teaching origins, &amp; a naturalistic view of the universe. Then, there is a long period of silence from the courts, as the world war raged, &amp; God was appealed to &amp; acknowledged in every aspect of US culture.  Prayers were publicly offered 'for the boys', and the nation had an appearance of deep spirituality and piety.  Less than a decade after WW2,  they put 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. 'In God we trust' was the official motto, put on money, &amp; adopted in 1956, the waning years of this short interruption in progressive domination.

Remember the commie witch hunts? It was a feeble attempt to rid American culture of anti American, destructive influences, &amp; is now hailed by progressives everywhere (who are more sympathetic to the communists, the target of the hunts) as 'hate crime', &amp; bigotry.

But by the 70's, darwinian theory had become dominant, &amp; it now was not content to be given equal footing with a supernatural view of origins &amp; the universe, but demanded a monopoly.. they were to become the ONLY view allowed by the courts, in the state run indoctrination centers, aka public schools.

*WMAP observations also support an add-on to the big bang framework to account for the earliest moments of the universe. Called ""inflation,"" the theory says that the universe underwent a dramatic early period of expansion, growing by more than a trillion trillion-fold in less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. Tiny fluctuations were generated during this expansion that eventually grew to form galaxies.*

So, a period of 'inflation', where the laws of physics were set aside for '*less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second'!*, occured, it is suggested. The entire universe exploded in an instant, filling millions of light years of space, allowing light and other waves continuity, so they can be seen, now, without having to wait billions of years for them to get here.

But by what standard do you arbitrarily assign '13.77 billion years!', as the age of the universe, if you posit an inflation of 'less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second', to expand it to its current condition? It could have been just millions, or even thousands.. why arbitrarily choose '13.77 billions!', when there is NO WAY of knowing how far back this 'inflation' took place?

*'Tiny fluctuations grew to form galaxies!'*

 Really?  Can you not see the fantastic speculation going on here, dogmatically declared as 'science!'?

And just HOW did this inflation allegedly happen, suspending all known natural laws? Trillions fold expansion in trillionths of a second? The acceleration to do this would vaporize any matter.  And then it stops, suddenly, overcoming all inertia in this imaginary fantasy of godless origins?  This phenomenon cannot be observed, repeated, or any mechanism explained. It is a physical impossibility, yet is glibly declared as 'settled science!', and eager bobbleheads eat it up like candy.

It's presented as solid and proven in the popular press but I'm regularly reading scientists complaining about how there is not enough evidence behind it.

I realize that a lot of people here think dating and eons like the cretaceous are fiction, nevertheless if cretaceous fossils keep turning up mixed with marine fossils, and the impact hypothesis becomes weakened I think that would make a strong scientific case for a global flood wiping out the dinosaurs.

I need help on astronomy/starlight.,"Next month i'm having a 1hour 20min debate with an Evolutionist in front of a small audience (maybe a dozen people). 5 minutes opening speech for each side, then a 20 minute slideshow/speech for each side, a 25 minute rapid fire debate time, and then closing statements.

The debate is about Young Earth/Old Earth as a whole, so anything is permitted. My main focus is on geology and archeology, while my opponent is focused on distant starlight.

He already knows about the anisotropic synchrony convention and will attempt to combat it with redshifts. He will also go into other astronomical ways to 'support' the old Earth. Problem here is that i'm not well understood in astronomy/starlight. My opponent is always one step ahead of me.

My request for help is in bullet points:

•What pieces of astronomy support a Young Earth?
•How does redshifts fit with the ASC?
•Where did moon craters come from, if it was not the result of millions of years of astroid hits?

Thanks in advance. I'm eager for this debate.",37,1578020640,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ej95dq/im_having_a_real_life_debate_next_month_i_need/

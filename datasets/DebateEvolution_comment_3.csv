t1_ffv1zah,t3_eurawo,"I went to a elementary-high school that taught YEC. I didn’t know essentially anything about evolution until I got to college. Our biology textbooks even presented everything in a “Christian” light meaning they framed everything from the reference of creation. Things like “cells are so complex but perfect there is no way it could have all come together over billions of years.” However, after years of being essentially indoctrinated and being presented what seemed like very weak refutations of evolution, I was skeptical towards my later years. When I got to college and started taking biology classes, evolution just made sense. In comparison to the outlandish arguments I had heard for creation all my life, evolution is just simple. It makes perfect sense with the data. Those creationist arguments I had seen over and over fell apart very quickly. It’s only since joining this sub have I seen how strongly the YEC community does not/chooses not to understand the basic principles of evolution. It seems to me many deliberately choose not to understand, as seen with PDP throwing out Darwin’s whole argument based upon the definitions of neutral and fitness. They present such weak straw men it’s really just incredible.",1580255256

t1_ffuz3fd,t3_eurawo,"Actually I find it the one classification level that is denied by most people where “Old World Monkey” might give you information on colobus monkeys and cercopiths more often than it will admit that technically all Catarrines are Old World Monkeys, a sister group to the Platyrrines which everyone will agree are monkeys. When trying to set them apart from apes they’ll produce something like this: https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/what-is-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes or this: https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes

So basically if it’s a monkey that falls into the category of human, chimpanzee, siamang, gibbon, bonobo, gorilla, or orangutan then it’s not a monkey. That’s their basic argument when you break it down. Lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers are primates but not monkeys. 

It’s easier to illustrate with phylogenetic relationships.

All living primates have a rhinarium like most mammals still have (a wet nose) which includes the aye-aye, loris, galago, and lemur or they have a dry nose like us. Those with a dry nose are called Haplorhines. Of the dry nosed primates we have tarsiers and simians - you’re one of the other. The simians are either platyrrines which are the New World Monkeys and the Catarrines - this group *would be Old World Monkey* universally but that’s where the problem arises as the sister group to New World Monkeys is split between Apes and Old World Monkeys by those who won’t admit we are monkeys too. The Old World Monkeys that are not apes are things like baboons, macaques, colobus monkeys, langur monkeys, vervets and so forth. 

For “monkey” to have any useful meaning for a single group of animals we’re talking about one of two choices. The baboons and macaques are not monkeys or apes are too. Instead they tend to create two groups of monkeys with apes being more closely related to one of these groups than the two monkey groups are related to each other. The ancestor of all Catarrines looked like a monkey and animals like Aegyptopithecus were ape-like monkeys showing a clear trend towards becoming an ape and Proconsul was a monkey-like ape being about no more ape-like at first glance than the Barbary apes and langur monkeys which are a couple tailless non-ape monkeys. The most noticeable trait that sets us apart is the lack of a tail, but apes also have greater shoulder rotation and can hang from their arms from branches where most other monkeys walk on top of the branches or use a prehensile tail. We also have larger monkey brains than the other monkeys wound up with so this is also pointed at as well. It’s more about what we have that other monkeys don’t have or a trait *most but not all* monkeys have in common that we don’t share - even though the ancestor of the entirety of Catarrines was a monkey it diverged from the population that gave rise to monkeys in America and the ancestor of both groups, was itself a monkey, but a lot more lemur-like without the the defining traits that lemurs acquired since that split like such as the tooth comb - lorises are on our side of that split but Eosimius is a small monkey that might be a better representation of a common monkey ancestor for both groups and another animal called darwinius is likely the same thing for the branch leading to lemurs. This is what I was referring to as these two groups show many similarities but something more like purgatorias or another group similar would be more like the universal primate ancestor. I don’t need to really tell you about all of these evolutionary relationships, though, because my main point is that the ancestor of platyrrines and Catarrines is something we’d classify as a monkey, the ancestor of apes and cercopiths, too, we’d consider a monkey, and even Aegyptopithecus and similar animals leading to apes still had many of the defining characteristics of living monkeys and a whole lot less of the characteristics of living apes that gradually built up leading to us through animals like Proconsul, Nikalipithecus, and Sahelanthropus or similar looking groups so that what once was a monkey should still be a monkey, where evolution accepting apes-as-monkey deniers will suggest that, though apes derived from monkeys, they’re no longer monkeys anymore and such an idea is counter to how evolution works. You can’t outgrow your ancestry and for two groups to be actually the same thing (like monkeys) all of the in between groups and divergent lineages all the way back to and including the common ancestor would also have to be a monkey but monkeys could originate at that point as monkeys diverged from other dry nosed primates. Excluding Catarrines from being monkeys solves this problem differently to where the shared ancestor of both groups, wasn’t yet a monkey and neither were the descendants until they diverged from Catarrines and with prehensile tails and other traits they could be distinguished from all non-monkey primates more clearly having unique traits not found in our ancestry - and with this alternative “monkeys” from the old world are not monkeys either no matter the similarities they share with the monkeys from America.",1580253973
t1_ffuy4y1,t3_eurawo,"&gt;the tragedy of it all is that creationists are actively trying to argue that god's majestic creation is fatally, hopelessly flawed in implementation

Spot on. The entire YEC view is a complete turn off. I used to adhere to it because I like science, and thought I could prove my faith with science. 

What did I find? Strawmen. Misrepresentations of the data. Self-deception in their work where they convince themselves that they ""don't challenge the empirical data, only the evolutionist interpretation"", even though work by the same authors had them saying, outright, [""That data has to be flawed somehow. Their methodology is seeing things that aren't actually there. It can't represent something real, because if it is, then we can't explain it.""](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/green-river-formation)

Frankly the YEC idea of creation makes the entire thing feel like a joke. Time and time again they propose miracles not even mentioned in the bible just because, if such miracles didn't occur, they can't save their model (looking at you, RATE). It's such a pathetic setup, and behaves so poorly, I can't see why anyone would bother. To me it seems way better to just stick to ""The bible said it, end of discussion"" and admit you don't know what to make of the data, rather than twisting it so horribly. But I guess people are supposed to accept it all, wholesale, no matter how blatantly flawed, because ""muh cruel animal death"" or something. Personally, I'll take a couple of theological challenges over absolute disgusting misrepresentation and flat out denial of the empirical data.",1580253834
t1_fftm7xl,t3_eurawo,"&gt; True in the closing statement, almost true when it comes to monkeys.

Nice info!

I recall someone from a country where the word ""monkey"" customarily includes great apes, interchangeable. Knowing they are technically wrong does not matter.

There is also [Captain Simian &amp; the Space Monkeys (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQVm48moTMM) blurring the distinction, to reconcile, even though it's only a cartoon. The audience wants/wanted to be one of the Space Monkeys, proud to be one too. In a case like that it's hard to ruin the fun by disqualifying them by saying they are not a monkey, then turn the channel. 

Science writing requires precision while for cartoons monkey is close enough for the creators and audience. It's too outside of science to matter to research, but exceptions do exist elsewhere. I was allowing for this type of situation.",1580252107

t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"I'm looking at his current math and I'm not sure if they even set up the probabilities correctly (never mind the conclusions/strawman attached to it). Here's what PDP is mathing:   


&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs  with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any  one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now  let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate  of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 1/27 = 2/810  
&gt;  
&gt;(First  mutation has a probability of 2 choices out of a possible set of 30  choices. Second mutation has only one choice out of a remaining 27  possible (9 remaining bases with 3 choices each)).  
&gt;  
&gt;One of them only?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 26/27 = 52/810  


The issue with the above math is that it assumes a search space of all possible base pairs across our hypothetical genome at each state. That's not actually what the problem is asking for, it is asking for the probability of mutation at 1 locus and then asking what is the probability that the locus mutates again to a specific allele (the ancestral). The PDP math shows all possible allele mutations across the genome and not the likelihood of mutation occurring at single locus.

See if this makes sense:

1)  Mutation rate of 2 base pairs (bp) per generation, with a 100% probability of occurring.

2) 10 nucleotides in our genome of interest with no mutation bias

3) The probability that a nucleotide changes at any locus is 1/10 + 1/9 = 0.21 (because we are assuming that a single locus only mutates once per generation).

4)  The probability that a locus changes once is 0.21 (we don't actually care what the nucleotide changes to, so we don't multiple by 1/3)

5) The probability that an already mutated locus changes back to the original locus is then 0.21 \* 1/3 = 0.07 or 7% for the posterior probability. For the prior it is 0.21\*0.21\*1/3 = 0.0148 \~ 0.015 or 1.5%.",1580244445
t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"He really is just a lost cause. He doesn’t agree with your definition of neutral as having no effect on fitness. He just quotes out of context the same two papers as “proof” that the population geneticist community thinks there are no such things as neutral mutations. He refuses to do the simple math because your starting definitions are “wrong.” It’s incredible because that wasn’t even why he thought you were wrong initially, just that you did the math wrong. I really don’t get this guy. I’ve only had one discussion with him and gave up after two responses because he was frustrating me so badly. He needs to stop using Kimura and Eyre-Walker/Keightley as his “irrefutable proof.” Scientists do not rely on two papers used out of context when constructing a thesis/hypothesis/whatever, and they certainly do not rely on two papers used out of context to challenge a well established theory. It’s honestly disgraceful to science in general and scientists everywhere. If he is going to try and challenge a theory, he needs to do a full literature review worthy of being published in a peer reviewed journal, and literature reviews are no easy task. They have hundreds of sources and are often times longer than 30-40 pages. They take months to draft and much longer with the review process.

&gt;&gt;Its worth pointing out that as you saturate viable mutations, your chance of back mutations increases.

&gt;&gt;No, it totally, absolutely is true. The independent probabilities are equal. The first mutation is only a given after it has occurred.

In fact, there are many new selection hypotheses that replaced natural selection and are still being underdetermined by the evidence.

It's a matter of tailoring the data to fit the theory, now, as long as you follow the natural selection template, you can make ""jack sparrow is king of the pirates"" entirely compatible with the theory.

I just find it odd that no evolutionist considers this a problem and instead resorts to personal attacks.

t1_fft6v71,t3_eurawo,"The dishonesty continues:

&gt;Here is one of the entries in our very long discussion, written by DarwinZDF42:

&gt;&gt;Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A after that first mutation happens. In the second instance, the first mutation has already happened. Its probability is 1. So we're considering the two events independently, and the probabilities are approximately equal. With me?

&gt;This is a complete misdirection when talking about back mutations, because we are NOT talking about independent probabilities. The first mutation, being a given, has a probability of 1 (as he has said), but the back mutation has a probability of 1/30 (in his example). He concluded their probabilities are roughly equal, but you tell me: is 30/30 roughly equal to 1/30?

How many times do I have to say it? I'm comparing the probability *of the first mutation, before it happens*, with the probability of the back mutation, *after the first occurs.*

t1_fft1yuz,t3_eurawo,"Because the evidence is of mutations that occur that result in fitness, death, or are effectively neutral with most of them having little to no noticeable effect on survival. The claim of genetic entropy is that perfect genomes degrade over time - all mutations are deleterious and that’s not what we find. Mutations that result in three potential outcomes not only change the allele frequency over time but result in multiple lineages accumulating different mutations so that if these differences piled up for long enough the populations would continue to diverge - the process by which speciation occurs. The idea that organisms evolve with guidance or some end result also doesn’t hold up when the lineages are evolving in all directions as you’d expect from a blind process. And, finally, if natural selection was allowed to purify the gene pool the observed results trend towards the more beneficial mutations as the detrimental ones are slowly weeded out of the gene pool. In this experiment the gene pool was kept consistent and all of the organisms in each population were treated equally being provided everything they need to survive where in nature they’d compete for these resources and the ones not as good at it would eventually just die without passing on their broken genetics. 

Everything is as predicted and described by evolutionary theory, nothing about this is possible if the mutations never occurred or if they were all driven towards the same goal and when beneficial mutations do arise making populations more fit for survival than their ancestors it is a blatant contradiction to the idea that this can’t happen. Yet it continues to happen even when natural selection is effectively removed from the equation.",1580215346

Backup shuttles? Backup solid state boosters? Backup astronauts on board?

Or is it possible you didn't think this through?

If you're going to play the snide semantics game, then I can too, but that seems thoroughly counterproductive to discussion. I am trying to be nice: the least you can do is refrain from being a dick about it.

The shuttle was moreover designed to go to places where if shit broke, NOBODY WAS COMING TO FIX IT. Very, very special case.

That is not how we typically design things, because in most cases, we have engineers handy to come fix stuff. Desktop computers are not designed to be self-reliant, self-repairing independent installations. Saying ""lol backup ur data"" has nothing to do with this. Personal user data is irrelevant to this question. 

Whether there is user data or not, if the HD with the OS on a computer goes boom, *the computer is fucked*. We do not design computers to innately handle internal hard disk failure, even though we know it totally happens. We COULD, obviously, but there is no need. Far easier to just go buy another HD, or another computer. 

Life does not have this luxury, and nor is life designed.

Now let's get back on topic: if you cannot say (without context) which sequence has more information, or even determine which is mutated, then you *cannot* say mutations always reduce information.

Secondly, since back mutations can occur, you also cannot say mutations always reduce information (because the back mutation will increase 'information' by whatever arbitrary unit you chose).

Could you address THESE points rather than attempting to digress?

(by the way, the handbrake is for holding the car stationary once stopped, the footbrake is for actually stopping. I feel I should point this out.

t1_ffr7eyw,t3_etjksh,"&gt; Redundancy is not an important feature in any complex machine we build: if the hard disk on my computer dies, my computer is fucked.

You need to read this: [zen and the art of IT backup](https://gist.github.com/nooges/817e5f4afa7be612863a7270222c36ff). If your data is not backed up, essentially, you do not have any data. Computer redundancy: RAID is good, but now we can also sync thing to the cloud, there are also companies like Acronis that specialize in data backup.  I hope this help and you can start backing up your data. Otherwise you might as well just throw your hard disk away now, because it will fail sooner or later.

Have you considered that we have a hand brake AND a foot brake in a car, two completely separate braking systems (one better than the other)?

&gt; Generally if we need something to be robust, we just make it simpler, so broken bits are easier to replace.

Well, not simpler. The space shuttle was one of the most complex pieces of machinery ever created. It had multiple backups of everything (life support, also multiple computers that checked each other for errors). But it was designed to be modular so that bits are easier to replace.

&gt;A [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/ffrep0z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) between myself and DarwinZDF42 explored the relationship between probabilities and back mutations. He was insistent that a back mutation was roughly equal in probability to the original, and in so doing he aims to suggest that they are a significant factor to consider which ameliorates the problem of deleterious mutations in the genome. This could not be further from the truth, and I'll try to succinctly explain why using a simple math example.

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.

&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?

&gt;1/30 \* 1/30 = 1/900

&gt;One of them only?

&gt;1/30 \* 29/30 = 29/900

&gt;You can see that new mutations are highly more probable than back mutations.

&gt;**EDIT: I changed this post because I decided that my original formulation was unintentionally misleading, since back-mutations happen from one generation to the next, not within the confines of a single generation of mutations.**

&gt;Please feel free to comment with any corrections if you have any.

&amp;nbsp;

This *still* isn't addressing the point I made. I'm talking about a *single* mutation occurring, and then the *single* back mutation occurring. The probability of the first mutation occurring is equal to the probability of the back mutation, given that that the first mutation has already occurred.

They are quite similar even when we compare the coding regions of humans and dogs, cats, pigs, and cows as well, but the similarity drops to about 84%. This is the type of pattern we find in the genetics such that by just comparing that and the same genes located in the same locations including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses that shows clear points of divergence from a common ancestor.

As expected, we find that when comparing our own genetics to those of chimpanzees is there not only 98.8% similarity comparing the coding genes and 96% when we compare the entire genome but we also find the same genes in the same locations with the most significant differences found in the intergenous regions and in the chromosome fusion. Of course, there are several mutations within the coding regions as well that set us apart like 400 million differences across 3 billion base pairs which, though only a 1.2% difference is still a lot more than you’d fine in a single generation or even 6000 years, for example.",1580183351
t3_eurawo,t3_eurawo,"[Still at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/), still doesn't understand probabilities, now making a *different* argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

Y'all see this shit?

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;Now we can do some very simple math to find out which is more likely-- getting two different mutations, or getting a back mutation of the first mutation in our second mutation.

&gt;The first of the two mutations is not specified--it is random and it could be anything. So the probability of the first mutation is 1. All values equally likely.

&gt;Now for the second mutation. If it is NOT a back mutation, then that means we have only one value which is disallowed: the value that would produce a back mutation. Since the first mutation took one possible value away from us, that leaves us 29 remaining possibilities. That is a likelihood of 29/30.

&gt;Since for compound probabilities we multiply, then the likelihood of getting two mutations and NOT having the second reverse the first would be (1) * (29/30). We have a high probability of not reversing the first mutation. Notice how the level of certainty that we will NOT get a back mutation only goes up and up the larger the number of possibilities becomes.

&gt;Contrariwise, if we want to see the likelihood of getting two mutations and having the second one reverse the first one ( a back mutation ), we just multiply our two compound probabilities once more, this time inverting the number. We landed on one of the 30 possible choices with mutation #1, and so for the second mutation we have only one possible mutation out of 30 that would result in a back mutation. That's 1/30.

&gt;I hope this simple explanation will suffice to explain why back mutations are so unlikely. In our oversimplified example of a tiny genome of 10 base pairs (compared to 3 billion), the difference in probability for getting a back mutation is the difference of 29/30 versus 1/30 or .967 compared to .033.

Compare that to what I wrote before:

&gt;Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. Assuming all are equally likely (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30.

&gt;With me so far? Great.

&gt;So the first A mutates to G.

&gt;Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates back to A? 

(I left the obvious answer - 1/30 - unstated.)

The point is *not* that the back mutation is as likely as *all of the other mutations*. The point is that the back mutation is as likely as *the original mutation was before that first mutation occurred*. 

&amp;nbsp;

And a few hours ago, Paul got that that was what I was saying, but thought I had the math wrong:

&gt;The probability of getting both those mutations together is 1/30 * 1/30, which is 1/900.

&amp;nbsp;

But now, the story has changed, and he's saying I made a claim that I never made. 

I'm trying to set an example and be really nice to people, even when I think they're being shady. But this is some bullshit. Paul is a liar, straight up.

I already have.  Your argument is pointless because your premise is flawed.

&gt;Not a single theory can be said to be true

Theories are, in general, the best explanations we have for a given phenomenon. It truly logical sense, they are the **least strong** explanation we have.  That said, I challenge you to find anything wrong with the theory of evolution, keeping in mind that there is nothing within the theory that says that it must occur slowly.

t1_ffruo8l,t3_eurawo,"In the MA experiments, they assess fitness in ""steps"" usually with each generation or a subset of generations.

Each step assumes a number of mutations on the basis of previously established mutation rates in the organism.   


When sequencing became cheaper and easier, like in the Dillon paper that PDP often quotes, whole-genome sequencing was done in addition to the fitness evaluation. The proportion of neutral mutations in sequenced MA's (even with all the ridiculous non-natural caveats) is still higher than deleterious mutations. In Keightley's early works, like this 2002/2003 paper, MA experiments are looking at amino-acid changing/altering mutations. As Keightley correctly summarizes in the DFE paper for 2007, the majority of mutations across the genome are neutral.",1580167544

To clarify:

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range

Reproductive fitness of each lineage was assessed by the number of fruits per plant and the number of seeds per fruit, the latter obtained as an average over four fruits. No sequencing was performed to look across all mutations occurring per generation; rather, phenotype was used to infer the fitness of the mutation type. This means it is impossible to show/count the number of neutral mutations via this experiment since the mutations must necessarily affect phenotype to be observed--which neutral mutations don't do. Further, the phenotype being measured may not account for the entire genome, but rather only the genes/portions that are responsible for fruit/seed bearing.   


Since the phenotype between generation changes, the mutations are necessarily affecting the amino-acids/coding-regions in some way. Therefore, Keightley correctly refers to them as amino-acid mutations.

No doubt this is leading up to the common, boring creationist tactic of claiming ""faith in science"", which is one of the most pernicious and enduring forms of theistic equivocation. Confidence in careful procedures and collection of evidence is not the same as your unevidenced faith in the supernatural. One is objective, the other is not. One bases its conclusions upon evidence, while you will never have your conclusion changed on the basis of evidence, as it was never determined by that means to begin with.

It’s an ironic argument, because the claim of the existence of an atheist metaphysics is itself based on an assumption that not only does empirical knowledge require faith, but it claims to explain everything. However, naturalism necessarily does exactly the opposite, leaving a potentially infinite space under the domain of the unknown. The very nature of our quest to expand our sphere of knowledge, the knowledge paradigm itself, forces us to accept and make peace with the unknown, for it will always be with us.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think theHating is trying to distinguish between what is fact and what is for all practical purposes fact.

&gt; These explanations do not fit all the facts, and so they become revised, battles rage on and the indefensible is defended with utter contempt for what science ought to be about.

I would disagree with the idea that at this present moment explanations we have for evolution do not fit the evidence we have it. I haven't been presented with any evidence that contradicts any of today's Theory of Evolution's principles (the theory is basically a crystallization of the observations anyways), but evolution has been adjusted in the past and will probably be in the future, like with the broad acceptance of punctuated equilibrium.

Similarly, every biologist I've interacted with is ""sure"" what causes evolution, to the same extent of the above (We've seen mutation happen. We've seen natural selection, artificial selection, population bottlenecks), in that ""sure"" is a position of extremely high confidence that still leaves room for the potential of falsification or an additional selection method discovery.

&gt;&gt; The first toss already happened. It's in the past. The probability is one.

&gt;&gt;If I asked ""what's the probability of, in the future, a mutation occurring, *followed by* its back mutation"", you'd be on track. But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, *given that a mutation has already occurred*, what is the probability of the back mutation occurring?

&gt;DarwinZDF42  
Where we stand in time is irrelevant. The probability of two tails in a row is always going to be 1/4, regardless of whether we are in the middle of flipping or whether we have not yet flipped.

This is incredible. I'm finished with this exchange, so Paul can respond however, because he's so far off base and obviously not going to magically start understanding how probability works. 

For everyone else:

I have a coin, and I ask ""what's the probability that I get tails twice in a row?""

The answer is .25; 0.5 for the first toss, 0.5 for the second, they are independent, so you multiply the separate probabilities to get the combined probability. 

I flip the first coin. Tails. 

Now I ask ""what's the probability of a second tails?""

The answer is 0.5. I already did the first toss. It came up tails. That probability is now 1, because that event has already occurred in the past. And the probability of tails on the second toss is 0.5.

&amp;nbsp;

It works the same for mutations. The probability of two mutations at any one site is extremely low. But if a mutation happens, the probability of the back mutation is approximately the same as the original mutation that already occurred.

b) GE supporters believe that MA  experiments adequately represent natural evolutionary phenomena and that  the results favor the GE hypothesis. Here’s why that is untrue:

1. MA experiments **do not allow natural selection to happen**, meaning that the deleterious mutations cannot be selected out from the populations.
2. Bacterial strains used in MA experiments have certain DNA repair genes (such as mutS) **disabled so that MORE mutations occur** i.e.—not natural
3. The coding regions in these species represent **HUGE portions of their total genome 80-90% versus 10-20% noncoding**. The human genome is about 1% coding.
4. The **majority of mutations are not deleterious**  \[as shown in these experiments and in direct opposition to GE premises  stated earlier\] and that only rarely occurring mutations cause the  fitness declination observed in these studies.

No. The only reason I pointed that out is to inform you that there is at least one definition of ""information"" which is absolutely incompatible with Creationist usage of the word, so you really should *define your friggin' terms*.

&gt; You think that you need some clarity to tell if Creationists are referring to white noise or not when they use the term ""information""?

No. I think there are a number of different definitions of ""information"". I think that if someone wants to make a *scientific argument* about evolution which depends on ""information"", it really does behoove that someone to *explain which definition of ""information"" they're using*.

&gt;Anyone who uses the word ""information"" when discussing something with you…

See above re: ""scientific argument"". In the context of everyday life, I'm generally happy not to raise a fuss over the specifics of ""information"". But in the context of a discussion of science, yeah, I do want terms to be defined. When I'm talking to someone who shares my understanding of science, I tend to assume that they accept the standard mainstream definitions used in standard mainstream science; when I'm talking to a Creationist—a Young-Earth Creationist in particular—I *cannot* necessarily assume that they accept standard mainstream definitions, so asking for definitions may be required from time to time.

On to your questions.

&gt;1. Does DNA contain information?

In my view, no. It doesn't contain *any* ""information"". DNA is a molecule, and its constituent parts just go bopping around in strict accordance to the laws of chemistry and physics. In my view, people who make noise about ""information"" in DNA are employing figurative language that isn't an accurate description of the *actual* state of affairs, generally for the purpose of explaining things in a manner more easily comprehensible than if they stuck strictly to 100% accuracy.

By analogy, it's *philosophically possible* to explain the operation of a car engine *wholly and entirely* in terms of the interactions of the atoms/molecules of the fuel and engine, right? But such an explanation would be *extremely* bulky/awkward, and would, most likely, fail to be useful as an *explanation* of how that engine works.

&gt;2. Is DNA a code or perhaps a language?

Code: Define ""code"". If ""code"" is a means of transferring information from one mind to another using a protocol which prevents other minds from intercepting and comprehending that information along the way, then no, DNA is *not* a ""code"". If ""code"" is something else, then maybe?

Language: No. If it were a language, whatever message it's conveying could be translated into English. And yet, nobody seems to have any interest in making any efforts to translate DNA into English. If it were a language, the message it's conveying would have been transmitted from one mind, with the intent of being received by one or more other minds. And yet, nobody seems to have any idea of who's sending the alleged ""message"" that's conveyed by DNA, nor does anyone seem to have any interest in figuring out who the intended receiver of said alleged ""message"" might be.",1580159042

It's not and if you're not going to read or attempt to understand  what is actually being studied here then we should end the conversation.  The 2002 Keightley and Lynch paper, entitled ""TOWARD A REALISTIC MODEL  OF MUTATIONS AFFECTING FITNESS,"" is a response paper to a mutational  accumulation experiment done by  Shaw et al.--this is that whole 'peer  review' process going on. The ""other"" scientists claimed that their MA  experiment yielded 50% **ADVANTAGEOUS** mutations--which  every model of evolution denies is possible, including Neutral Theory.  MA experiments artificially prevent natural selection from occurring by  controlling mating, population size, and providing unlimited  food/resources. The entire paper is referring to mutations in coding  regions as is the Shaw et al. experiment. Quotes from the paper that you  ignored:

""However, in all taxa examined so far, average values of C are in  excess of 0.7 (e.g., Ohta 1995; Eyre-Walker et al. 2002), implying that  the majority of **amino-acid altering mutations** are deleterious.""

""There is nothing obviously unusual with respect to A. thaliana in  this regard. Wright et al. (2002) and S. Wright (pers. comm.) have  recently investigated constraint in **the protein-coding genes of two species**  of Arabi- dopsis, A. lyrata (an outcrosser) and A. thaliana (a natural  inbreeder), using an outgroup to infer lineage-specific constraint.  Estimates for C are 0.88 in both species, despite their different  systems of mating; C is likely to underestimate the fraction of **amino-acid mutations** that are deleterious due to fixation of advantageous **amino-acid mutations** and **purifying selection acting at synonymous sites** (Eyre-Walker et al. 2002).""

It is not only true, it is *demonstrably* true.

&gt;  it's a truth of language and doesn't require evidence for it to be true.

That's a nonsense statement.  The truth is what the facts are.  The facts are that evolution occurs, we have seen it, tested it, repeated it, and have an over-abundance of evidence that shows it.  

&gt; it most certainly does not fit all the facts.

It does, because that is a conclusion reached as a *result* of the facts.  Again, you're trying to do science backwards by picking something and attempting to fit the facts to it.  That's a common creationist tactic.

&gt; can you name an organism that isn't fit? 

Look at every population that has ever gone extinct.  That's 99% of every population that has ever existed.

&gt;  Some populations tend to undergo little to no change at all even as they are reproducing for 100s millions of years.

That's irrelevant.  If they have sufficient fitness to remain in their environmental niche, and no significant pressure on them, then their morphology may not change much; certain morphological forms seem to be at fitness plateaus or peaks for specific environments, and have independently evolved numerous times over the ages.  Sharks and crocodiles are prime examples of this.  However, if you took an early example of the population and a late one, or a modern and prehistoric shark, for example, you'd see significant genetic differences, as well as other changes in soft tissue, organ structure, immune system, and many other areas that don't translate well to the fossils that we see today.

t1_ffrcga1,t3_etledc,"From /u/pauldouglasprice 

&gt;u/DarwinZDF42 I can literally remember having this same mental block when I was learning about this in high school. How can the probability be different when you're flipping the same coin? How does the first flip influence the probability of getting the same result any number of times in a row? The way I got past this block was to realize that we are not considering them independently at all. We are asking the question, what is the probability of these two independent events both happening? You would never expect to keep flipping a coin over and over and get the same result each time, even though that is technically possible and even though the probability (1/2) is the same each time. It's multiplicative. Each time you flip, the odds of flipping it again to get the same result go down by an order of magnitude.

&gt;This is also why we find it highly strange to see that lightning has struck the same place twice. Because lighting can strike anywhere, and there are lots of places for it to strike. This is why back mutations are negligible. And that's one reason why you'll never reach this imaginary equilibrium you keep talking about.

Still not getting it. 

Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. *Assuming all are equally likely* (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30. 

With me so far? Great.

So the first A mutates to G. 

Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates *back* to A?

Or this: https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201648

Seems like when you look at the actual data it supports common ancestry between all domains and nothing even remotely related to a dependency tree. I mean there are some well preserved genes, but in one of those links they point out the huge variability within the DNA of all living organisms so they use ribosomal RNA to provide a phylogeny while the other compares while genomes anyway to provide much of the same picture but argues for a closer evolutionary divergence between the two prokaryotic domains. And they both support the idea that eukaryotes are based mostly on the genetics of Archaea but have also incorporated bacterial symbionts that have since became organelles. 

Then of course once we get to eukaryotes the evolutionary progression leading to us and most other lineages is shared here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMLnubJLPuw0dzD0AvAHAotW

And when we are talking about just animals with bones, here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9o6KRlci4eBBreHKyuGwHSwhmSfpxwqv

And then of course there is the overall genetic similarity and patterns of similarity (epigenetics) on top of just the overall similarity percentages like us and chimpanzees having the same genes in the same location and the same gene regulation and the same endogenous retroviruses and the same pseudogenes broken because of the same mutation so that the majority of our differences are found in the non-coding regions where we are only 96% identical comparing all of the differences to the genome like 610 deletions in the Alu regions, duplicated genes, broken genes in us that still work in them, and a chromosome fusion. By comparing the genes functional in both lineages we have something like 3 billion base pairs and only 400 million differences among them which is still a lot but this amounts to a 1.2% difference. Where it matters most we are 98.8% identical to chimpanzees where both of our lineages are 98.2-98.4% identical to gorillas showing that chimpanzees are more like us than either of us are like gorillas. And once you can overcome the idea of us being separately created from the other apes it isn’t much of a problem for how all of this can be traced all the way back to the findings in both of the links I provided. And if that wasn’t enough, we also have extinct transitional forms from Sahelanthropus dated to the point of our divergence from the line leading to chimpanzees and bonobos to Orrorin to Ardipithecus showing a trend towards more dedicated bipedalism which continues in Australopithecus until the boundary between them and our genus is fuzzy because of Australopithecus sediba, Homo naledi, Homo habilis, and Kenyanthropus platyops as well as a recently discovered transitional form that may actually be the actual transition leading to our genus despite all of these others being on the edge of what it takes to be classified as either of these two genera. And once firmly within the genus Homo the trend towards becoming humans is followed up by erectus, heidelbergensis, and rhodesiensis as well as a few others in between like antecessor. 

Dependency trees don’t really hold up or explain why we have these clear evolutionary transitions or all of this genetic evidence for common ancestry even among genes that apparently no longer serve the same function because of a shared mutation.

Humans can’t live long enough to see the full life-cycle of a star, but we can still piece together how that happens from looking at a multitude of examples. There are plenty of things we can never know without a time machine but that doesn’t make our answers unjustified.

&gt; But whether or not our understanding is true is apparently a question not worth answering to you people 🤔

So is your purpose here to complain about how epistemology? Then go to a philosophy sub. Science is the best tentative model we got, all that matters is the amount of evidence and justification for a model. Raising complaints based on some rather poor understandings of the technical minutia, is not the sort of thing that would bring us to “whoa Dude” moments. 

I do care about how “True” our truth is, but what your doing is closer to crying about how evolution is going to be in the same spot as when Newtonian mechanics was replaced by Einstein’s model and therefore everything modern evolution/Newton know was completely wrong and useless. 

But here’s the good news, Newton’s math is still useful for anything not in orbit or going near light speed, and from *everything* we can *currently* tell, evolution at worse will be the same.",1580156269

That is not the contention here.",1580156259
t1_ffjrdoe,t3_etx720,"\&gt; So their argument is essentially that genes we have are dependent on other genes that no longer do a whole lot but take up space? Or are they arguing that multiple lineages had to be fully formed in order to survive or, even better, that cell biology necessarily proves an all at once creation?   


You've missed the point entirely.   Whats the point of writing a rebuttal to something you  don't even now anything about?  disagree or agree you should first make sure you understand what you are debating against.  A quick intro is here  


[https://evolutionnews.org/2018/07/bio-complexity-presents-a-better-model-than-common-ancestry-for-explaining-the-pattern-of-nature/](https://evolutionnews.org/2018/07/bio-complexity-presents-a-better-model-than-common-ancestry-for-explaining-the-pattern-of-nature/)  


\&gt; Even if any of these flawed cases against evolution and common ancestry were accurate it still wouldn’t refute the observable genetic similarities that logically shouldn’t exist at all if the designer was intelligent or had the ability to create what evolution couldn’t explain like crocoducks and feathered horses. 

Actually if correct  it would show that they should logically exist.  I don't think it would  destroy all forms of evolution but it would devastate the unguided versions of it and would fit nicely into Intelligent design.

The dependency graph draws from Computer science and has little to do with ""an all at once creation"" (whatever that is supposed to mean).  Its based on the principles of libraries and dependency injection where  two programs  can share code without ""descent"".    


&gt; If there was really something that demanded a creator that would be something but all they ever have happens to be consistent with evolutionary theory 

Intelligent Design advocates already have that in the laws and constants of the Universe which evolutionary theory doesn't even remotely address (or any other scientific theory  for that matter). Atheist disagree but without much to proffer (which is  why  theism still rules  the world's population).  


&gt; Of course, genetic entropy would only show the limitations of the designer unable to make organisms that are able to evolve and persist without going extinct in less than ten thousand years because of molecular decay. 

Not much of a genetic entropy fan but generally that rebuttal is  weak.  I can create robots to last for a given time  and then decay in function without any limitations.  I don't have to create everlasting robots when doing so does not suit my purposes. Its even a worse  rebuttal to theistic viewpoints where there are natural consequences for  violations of moral law.  


\&gt; Edit: I was looking over there for this dependency graph but while there I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/esd0em/the_moons_origin_is_a_mystery_to_those_who_dont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). The problem is worse than I thought when planetary formation and collision events is where they turn to when they fail at cosmology, biology, chemistry and physics in general.   


whose the ""they""? As far as I know no one at r/creation has anything to do with  the ""dependency graph"".

t1_ffrbz4j,t3_entwuz,"Well, this is kind of what I was thinking at first as well, but alas, it is not true. It is actually quite obviously false if you think about it.

To clarify, I'm not saying that populations of stuff do not change, just that there isnt a single theory that can account for all it's mechanisms.

The definition you're giving me here is false for two obvious reasons:

1) it's a truth of language and doesn't require evidence for it to be true.

2) it most certainly does not fit all the facts.

""Bears with teeth get all the fish""

""Bigger tigers get all the ladies""

However, as it permeates the main theme of my original post, this is not always the case.

t1_ffr11a7,t3_etledc,"From /u/pauldouglasprice :

&gt;Update: DarwinZDF42 doubles down on his bad math concerning back mutations, failing basic probability theory (of the kind I learned in high school):

&gt;&gt;Then Paul objects to bit on back mutations - when A--&gt;B happens, then later B--&gt;A happens. He says that's too rare to consider. On net, such mutations will have approximately equal probability as the original mutations. It's not strictly equal, but close enough for a model as rough as this, considering just the number of possible mutations on each side of the ledger.

&gt;When you want to calculate the probability of the same thing randomly happening twice, you have to **multiply the probabilities**. They are not the *same probability*, or even similar. It is vastly less probable to see the same mutation happen in the same place twice, randomly, than to have it happen there only once. Stay far away from Vegas!

&amp;nbsp;

Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A *after that first mutation happens*. In the second instance, *the first mutation has already happened*. It's probability is 1. 

Like I said, this is not strictly true universally. (ssDNA viruses, for example, have a C--&gt;T bias, where C deaminates to T much more rapidly than T changes back to C. But that's a special case.) In general, the forward and reverse substitution rates are close enough that they can be considered equal. Google ""general time reversible model"". 

BTW, are you gonna dispute my math or just take wild potshots like this? If you want to show that I'm wrong, just answer these questions:

Does the relative frequency of *possible* deleterious mutations change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

Does the relative frequency of *possible* beneficial mutations change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

Does the selection coefficient change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

These mutations can be functionally neutral, deleterious, or beneficial and still be termed ""effectively neutral"" depending on the population size.  


A small selection coefficient near zero does not impact fitness--if it did, natural selection could act on it. This is a functionally neutral mutation as it depends on how NS ""perceives"" the mutation and not the size of the population. Functional definitions of neutral, beneficial, and deleterious describe what natural selection does to the mutation i.e.--fitness conferred contingent upon the environment.

t1_ffr2md0,t3_etjksh,"&gt; No, absolutely not. No one can tell. 

Which seems to puncture the entire ""mutations destroy information"" argument completely.

Basically, if you cannot say (without context) which sequence has more information, or even determine which is mutated, then you cannot say mutations always reduce information.

Secondly, since back mutations can occur, you also cannot say mutations always reduce information (because the back mutation will increase 'information' by whatever arbitrary unit you chose).

I absolutely appreciate your honesty here, and you are tackling this with a suitably open mind: you have all the pieces, you just need to put them together.

Note: Redundancy is *not* an important feature in any complex machine we build: if the hard disk on my computer dies, my computer is fucked. We really don't build things to be massively redundant, *especially* complex things. We want them to work at maximum efficiency, not maximum robustness.

Generally if we need something to be robust, we just make it simpler, so broken bits are easier to replace.

Biology works to different constraints: robustness is all, and efficiency is an entirely secondary concern. Mutations occur, and they can be bad. A codon alphabet that reduces the impact of those mutations is more robust than one that doesn't, and of course, it also had to evolve (interestingly, the codon alphabet all life uses is actually only mediocre on the 'optimality' scale: there are better codon charts, but ours is trapped in a local minimum).

There are many theories to explain evolution.

They are fine explanations, but none of them are true.

So I have asked around and landed here, is there a single theory that could reasonably be called ""THE theory of evolution"" and not be utterly vacuous.

So far, many have tried to assert many a theory to be THE theory, and all have failed to encapsulate the raw power of evolution.

My contention is shared by many a respected philosopher, including respected biologists.

I was asked this many times and I have obliged when a link has been provided. One bloke didn't care that I actually read it and asked him what he thought about Ernst Mayr's contentions.

Its always the same with you people; you assume, attack, and nothing is ever moderated because you enjoy life under the veneer of scientific respectability.

Im not asking for under-determined assets of evolution, I'm asking if there exists one asset that can reasonably be called THE theory.  It's a bit of a nuanced plea, and during every step I have acknowledged how I could be wrong.

Although the evolutionistssss here, always hammering on about looking at the evidence, don't wish to accept that the theory (what ever it is today) is likely going to be rejected and reformed again and again because it contains nothing scientific.  What you have is some post hoc categorical knowledge that, indeed, change has occurred, and happens now.  What you, gould, lawrence, dawkins, google, and everyone else here DO NOT have, is a perfect, true theory.

Essentially every single typical creation apologetics point is totally wrong when they say ""Random chance can't do that type of thing"". From the perspective of someone who is thinking deeply about evolution and trying to understand it, it looks as if **evolution is far too** ***orderly***. 

To expound on that more metaphorically than I did in the original post: sometimes to get a higher level of order you simply have to ""add on"" to your current theory (normal science, if you're into Kuhn).

&gt; One of these nucleotide sequences has a mutation. Devoid of any additional context, can you tell me which sequence is mutated, and whether that mutation has ""reduced"" the amount of information or not?

No, absolutely not. No one can tell. So it's not just the coding for amino acids that determines mutations, it's then end result as the protein. Which then makes it harder, because the protein functions in the context of the cell. A folded polypeptide in outer space -- well, no one can tell if it's been mutated to be worse or better than the original polypeptide.

&gt; Does a mutation 'destroy' information when it replaces one codon with another identical codon? 

Actually, aside from redundancy, which is an important design feature in any complex machine that we build, different codons change the speed in which the mRNA is transcribed, and this causes minor subsequent changes in the protein folding later.

Notice that Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. correctly refer to these mutations as *operational rather than functional*. This is specifically because this definition operates on precept of population size--which PDP either doesn't understand or doesn't acknowledge. They are also specifically referring to mutations in protein-coding regions of the genome--which is only 1% of all nucleotide in humans. If PDP or anyone else wants to continue reading the paper, Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. correctly contrast non-coding regions and then summarize the total effects of mutations across both coding and non-coding regions:  


“Unfortunately, accurate measurement of the **effects of single mutations is possible only when they have fairly large effects on fitness** (say &gt;1%; that is, a mutation that increases or decreases viability or fertility by more than 1%)” (ibid.)

“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**” (ibid.)

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.” (ibid.)

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95%  and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively  neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50%  of mutations are deleterious.**” (ibid.)

  
It's extremely clear Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. (2007) correctly state that the vast majority of mutations across the entire genome are neutral. Additionally, it's a trivial exercise to characterize mutations from the vast sequencing data that we have today and all data (even in highly contrived accumulation experiments) demonstrate that the majority of mutations do not impact fitness whatsoever. PDP wants to quote mine these publications and suggest that mutations which do not impact fitness of the organism *do indeed* impact fitness in a deleterious manner. He does this by continuously quote mining papers and then fails/refuses to show any evidence for this conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

In his post, PDP refers to the Dillon, M. and Cooper, V. (2016) paper: ""The Fitness Effects of Spontaneous Mutations  Nearly Unseen by Selection in a Bacterium with Multiple Chromosomes."" He tries to quote mine this paper again (which I have provided several responses which are ignored), but hilariously this paper actually demonstrates exactly what /u/DarwinZDF42 was talking about. They show an example of a deleterious mutation in two environments that is neutral is another environment:   


""The most consistently deleterious mutational event involved loss of the 0.164-Mb plasmid, which reduced fitness in TSOY and M9MM but not M9MM+CAA."" (ibid.)

""Although all distributions have a mode of near s = 0 and contain mostly lineages with deleterious or neutral fitness, we show that the distribution of effects across lineages is distinct for each environment (see Figure 2). One important difference is that M9MM contains four lineages that are significantly more fit than the ancestor, and unlike in TSOY and M9MM+CAA, lineages whose selection coefficients are not significantly different from 0 in M9MM are no more likely to be negative than they are to be positive (Chi-square test; x2 =0,d.f. =1, P =1) (see Figure 2). This suggests that fewer spontaneous mutations are deleterious for fitness in M9MM, possibly because a greater proportion of genes are unused when metabolizing only a single carbon substrate.""

There are a lot of issues with the use of 'information', and the lack of a concrete definition from the scientific community largely stems from the fact that it is, with respect to nucleotide sequence, very, very difficult to define. Moreover, the effect of *changes* in nucleotide sequence are similarly hard to define or quantify, and in many cases the result of a change is context specific.

It is thus...frustrating when creationists claim that ""all mutations destroy information"" or words to that effect: making that claim presupposes that you can quantify information sufficiently to be able to determine that. I shall illustrate the problems with this position thusly:

AAGCAGCCTGGCCCAGCTCCTGGACTGACCACTGTCAGAGCCCGTAACTATACTGAAT

AAGCAGCCTGGCCCAGCTCCTGGACTGACCACTGTCAGAGCCCGTAAGTATACTGAAT

One of these nucleotide sequences has a mutation. Devoid of any additional context, can you tell me which sequence is mutated, and whether that mutation has ""reduced"" the amount of information or not? 

Now, thus far every creationist that I have posed similar questions to has prevaricated or wandered down some idle thoughtstream about 'specified information' and how you can't say without more specified detail, all of which has led me to conclude, as we all basically suspect, that there is no clear creationist definition of *information* with respect to nucleotide sequence, and that ""all mutations destroy information"" is simply a PRATT that accords nicely with the claim that evolution can't happen, and that also doesn't require too much nuanced thought. 

In summary, yes: nucleotide sequence can absolutely hold information. With a given prearranged schema, we can even use it to store digital data.

With respect to actual genomic information, this becomes far, far less clear. 

1) most nucleotide sequence is non-coding, and most non-coding DNA is also repeat sequence, retroviruses or Alus. Sixteen kilobases of ATGG is, admittedly, a very highly ordered stretch of sequence, but it's also non-coding garbage sequence, and its length can easily be explained by slippage expansion during replication. Is it information? Maybe. Does it do anything? No. Does the fact that it doesn't do anything affect whether it counts as information or not? Well, that's the question, isn't it?

2) Coding sequence probably is the closest you could argue to being 'information' without needing to provide extra clarification, but even here it isn't straightforward: most coding sequence is highly redundant: there are 61 non-stop codons, and only 20 canonical aminos. Some aminos are rare codons, but for others there are as many as 6 different ways to encode them. In many cases the last nucleotide is completely irrelevant. Does a mutation 'destroy' information when it replaces one codon with another identical codon? Furthermore, since TAA, TAG and TGA are the stop codons, any stretch of non-coding nucleotide sequence with a low TA content is likely to contain a significant number of open reading frames. Simple addition of a transcription start site (by mutation) would allow those to be expressed, and some might be useful (antifreeze genes have arisen this way). Does this represent a loss of information?

3) Even coding sequence is not the whole story: most enzymes are ""three or four essential amino acids, and three hundred filler aminos"": outside of the active site, most enzymes can be monkeyed about substantially without affecting activity. Does a mutation that alters a non-important hydrophobic amino acid to another non-important hydrophobic amino acid represent a loss of information? If you like, proteins are closer to the old ""you can read words if the first and last letters are right and the rest are present in the wrong order"" trick: seteencns etssieallny anlooguas to tihs. 

With the added facet that as the only criterion is ""does it work"" (here, can you understand it), there is in fact no 'correct' spelling, only various functional spellings. How do you measure gains or losses in information in such a scenario?

4) Finally, every mutation that occurs can revert. If the argument is that all mutations result in information loss, this implies that A to C is a loss, while C back to A is ALSO a loss, somehow returning to the original state but losing info both times (I have had creationists genuinely try to argue this, so it's worth noting).

In summary, ""DNA CONTAINS INFORMATION"" is not terribly controversial. We all accept this, and evolutionarily it is pretty easy to see how it would arise.

""DNA CONTAINS INFORMATION, AND THUS WAS WRITTEN BY A CREATOR AND IS DESTROYED BY MUTATIONS"" is much more controversial, and requires a much more specific definition of information such that it can be empirically discerned from the more mutation-tolerant evolutionarily generated stuff above.",1580148436

t3_eurawo,t3_eurawo,"The weird thing I found is that his paper does support part of the idea, but not all of the concept of genetic entropy for several reasons:

1. Even if most mutations missed by natural selection were spontaneous and damaging to the original genes, many benefits arose from gene deletions. Our large brain is possible because of them.

2. If ever these genes actually became deleterious for survival they are removed from the gene pool allowing other less damaging mutations to persist

3. Beneficial mutations occur

So basically we have genes stop functioning more often than they gain additional functions where the rates are bad enough to notice 2-12 deletions that don’t immediately result in death and only around 0.5% of the time do they add functionality. When it comes to natural selection it only matters when the threshold is crossed, which the author said rarely happens in this case so that in the evolutionary sense most mutations are neutral when it comes to survival.

The summary of this is that spontaneous mutations tend to damage genes than to add functionality to them, though new functionality can arise at a really low rate but even then there are rarely ever any mutations that result in death or infertility so that all survivable mutations spread through the population and evolution progresses via the same mindless process it always has. Without death caused by these mutations, the relatively low chance of acquiring a beneficial mutation becomes inevitable given enough time and whenever additional mutations make these mutations actually deleterious for survival they result in an evolutionary dead end. The result of this down the line is evolution by natural selection where rare chance mutations eventually outcompete the slightly more common damaging ones. 

This was explained better by PhD holding scientists, but this is my take on it.",1580148344

&gt;Neutral: Does not affect fitness.

He says:

&gt; Effectively neutral mutations DO affect fitness

But he ignores the definition of ""fitness"" three lines down:

&gt;Fitness: Reproductive success.

So all his huffing and puffing about effectively neutral comes back to not liking the actual definition of neutral, because, [he admits](https://creation.com/fitness), doesn't work for creationists:

&gt;Only when we insist that the terms of the debate be fair and accurate will we have any chance to clearly communicate the truth of creation and the bankruptcy of Darwinism to the world at large.

So this opening bit is a pointless rehashing of *that* old argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next he takes issue with the argument that the fitness effects of mutations can change. 

I mean, I don't know what to say here. It's not up for debate. You can go on all day about how *most* mutations are deleterious. Fine. Those effects change based on the genetic and ecological context. They are not absolute.

&amp;nbsp;

Then Paul objects to bit on back mutations - when A--&gt;B happens, then later B--&gt;A happens. He says that's too rare to consider. On net, such mutations will have approximately equal probability as the original mutations. It's not strictly equal, but close enough for a model as rough as this, considering just the number of possible mutations on each side of the ledger.  

Same for epistasis. Paul says it's too rare to consider. Fine. The models in the OP don't incorporate it. The assumptions I used are extremely favorable to creationists. Paul, did you even look at the math?

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, he objects to this statement...

&gt;Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated.

...on the grounds that this misrepresents how ""genetic entropy"" works. He says the selection differential stays zero, indefinitely. 

This is *literally impossible* if there is a fitness cost to mutations accumulating, at some point. Unless everyone in the population has *exactly* the same mutations, genotypes, and epigenotypes (not *number* of mutations, but *exact same mutations*) OR they all start off equal (nope) and nobody suffers any fitness cost (required for ""genetic entropy""), there will be differences in fitness, which means some subset of genotypes will have a fitness cost, i.e. a non-zero selection differential. 

&amp;nbsp;

So those are Paul's objections. 

&amp;nbsp;

You know what I'm not seeing here? Paul disputing my numbers. My little models are *extremely* favorable to creationists. 99% deleterious, yet completely unselectable, and only 0.1% beneficial, with deleterious mutations accumulating linearly. Every one of those parameters is unrealistically favorable to creationists. I mean come on. Paul objects *conceptually* to my argument, but he is not doing so *mathematically*. If I'm wrong, I want someone to *show their work*. My mutation rate coefficients in that last model are -0.002 and 0.001. If that's wrong, *what are the correct numbers*? Show *mathematically*, given *your* ratio of b/n/d mutations, that there *isn't* an equilibrium point. That deleterious mutations *do* accumulate infinitely.

Effectively neutral mutations DO affect fitness, but that effect is too small (individually!) to overcome the random effects of drift or 'noise'. It's too weak a signal.

Besides this, however, I want to home in on a few of the most important and salient points he made.

&gt;There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur.

This statement plainly runs contrary to science. In reality, the vast majority of all possible mutations are deleterious. The only real variable is *how* deleterious.

**""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007;Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations.

This possibility is so rare and unlikely as to be completely negligible when considering our fitness distribution. Back mutations are like having lighting strike at the same spot twice, since mutations are random and the genome is very, very large.

Think about this: the human genome contains [3 billion base pairs](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ). What he is saying is that once you change one of these for the worse (most mutations are very small), then it's technically possible that another mutation could come along and hit the same spot and put it back to where it was before.

Well, yeah, that *could* happen, but it's so vastly unlikely as to be negligible. That explains why this is such a rare phenomenon. In some cases, it may even represent evidence of genomic repair mechanisms that are not yet well understood ([in other words, it may not be random at all](https://creation.com/at-last-a-good-mutation))!

&gt;The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact.

DarwinZDF42 isn't clear on why epistasis is supposed to help his case. The fact that mutations interact actually makes the whole problem worse for various reasons. For one thing, synergistic epistasis means they work together. This means that the damage caused by multiple deleterious mutations becomes not just additive, but exponential, as the mutations are worse in combination than they would be apart!

And then you have antagonistic epistasis, where they work against each other. This makes beneficial mutations *less helpful*, since sometimes a beneficial mutation ceases being beneficial when combined with another beneficial mutation! This is particularly bad considering how rare these types of mutations are to begin with.

Dr. John Sanford has dealt at length with the problem of epistasis, both in his book and this [exhaustive numerical simulation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0013). Epistasis is simply no way out of the entropy problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated.

Here he shows that he still does not really understand the problem of genetic entropy. The idea is not that most mutations are unselectable until they reach a certain threshold. Where he got this from I don't know. The idea is that most mutations are unselectable, period. And it isn't technically because they have a selection differential of 0, but because that differential is so small that it is drowned out by other factors. They just keep on damaging things and natural selection keeps on failing to notice them because they are too small.

**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

**""In terms of evolutionary dynamics, however, mutations whose effects are very small ... are expected to be dominated by drift rather than selection.""**

The threshold is not at the level of the individual, as even Kimura himself understood. The threshold is at the level of the **population as a whole**. These mutations are happening constantly in every member of the population! Each human being has about 100 new mutations compared to their parents. Selection only works relative to other members of the population, but if everybody is degenerating at roughly the same gradual rate, then selection is powerless to stop this. Do you see DarwinZDF42's attempt at a sleight of hand here?

I anticipated this a while back when I wrote the following article, published in Creation magazine:

**Genetic Entropy: The Silent Killer,** ***Creation*** **41(4):48–50, 2019**

It's not yet published to the website, but I'll quote a short excerpt here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Forced to acknowledge that NS is blind to nearly-neutral mutations, a common evolutionist response is, ‘Once the accumulating damage from the mutations becomes significant, NS will start to remove them.’ But this fails to understand the problem. Natural selection can only weed out individual mutations as they happen. Once mutations have accumulated enough to be a real, noticeable problem, they are then a problem in the entire population, not just in an individual here or there. The whole population cannot be ‘selected away’—except by going extinct!",1580146165

Principle X is a corollary of the idea that the reason life is so diverse is because it changes.

Okay, and you've told me about principle Y, and a generalization under principle Y is just a reasonably concluded to fit under the idea.

My point is that, while these are all fine explanations, they do not capture the everything, they are not stand-alone hypotheses, and in many ways, they contradict eachother.

t1_ffqroot,t3_etjksh,"Of course I understand the intuitive notion of information with which creationists come to this kind of debate, but intuitions aren't a substitute for scientific definitions. I suspect that that intuition, like our every-day use of ""information"", is far too teleological to be of objective use in this context.

Specifically, the problem arises when creationists come to debates like this, confidently wielding the I-word, with nothing more in mind than the famous [Stewart definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it). You illustrate this perfectly by referring to the use of the word in casual speech. Now I don't think *you* are trolling. But I think you might make more of an effort to understand why this is not acceptable to us. It means that a creationist can say ""information is a problem for evolution"" and then, *whatever* empirical evidence we offer in return, can just retort ""nah that's not what I *meant* by information"".

Under such circumstances debate is impossible. So,

- If you want to say, in the colloquial sense, that DNA contains information, or that that's a useful metaphor to understand what DNA does, that's fine and I'll agree with you.

- If you want to say ""DNA contains information"" and then somehow operationalise that fact to define empirical predictions in the creation/evolution debate, I want to know *exactly* what you mean. It doesn't matter what it is - Shannon information, Kolmogorov complexity, whatever - as long as it's objective.

The two situations are not comparable. Reacting to them differently is *not* inconsistency on my part.

Similarly, in response to your second question, those are both metaphors for what DNA does that make sense on many levels, yes. Some of the (wrongly named) [Hockettsian design features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockett%27s_design_features) of natural human language, like duality of patterning and arbitrariness, have an analogue in the genetic code. Which is why, normally, I'd have no problem with expression like *genetic code*, unless - *unless* - you're going to start using this metaphor to transfer *other* properties of one system, like intelligence, to the other (leaving aside for the moment the second problem, viz. that Hockett's design features aren't designed in the first place). That's when you're mistaking a convenient metaphor for a system with the same fundamental properties, and consequently that's when I'll start asking for a higher degree of rigour in your use of terms.

Again, no inconsistency there, and certainly no wilful attempt to misunderstand you.",1580144805
t1_ffjqe7a,t3_etx720,"The Ewert paper? It's worse than that.

They're mostly tracking 'gene families' as defined by poorly-annotated genomes (so a 'gene family' of arbitrarily picked genes that are shared between an ocelot and a lancelet might exclude a very ocelot-like relative because the genome for that is poorly annotated. I went over this with nomenmeum via PM a while back (original text I wrote mostly quoted below):

 

&gt;It is...not a great paper. It is not written terribly, which is a plus, but the methodology has several major flaws which should perhaps be addressed (and which would likely have been spotted during peer review).  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Conceptually, trying to suggest genomes are arranged like javascript dependencies is...just weird. There are a ton of different ways to 'design' software architectures, so focusing on javascript is oddly specific (given the supplementary data files are all .json files, I suspect Ewert just likes working within a java environment). A lot of object-oriented programming architectures actually use very nested-tree-like arrangements: an 'object' with a ton of universally-applicable code, various classes descended from that object, each of which inherits that code but adds modifications, and ongoing nested trees of subclasses extending from those respective lineages, overwriting ancestral inheritances if necessary. It's a remarkably powerful and very parsimonious approach. If I were to posit a designer, that would be the design approach that seemed to best fit the data (but then that would also imply descent).  
&gt;  
&gt;2) The choice of datasets is odd: HOGENOM, for instance, is a dataset specifically aimed at comparative genomics between prokaryote lineages. It contains 1233 prokaryote organisms, but only 37 mammals. The metazoa included in that dataset are for outlier comparative analysis (i.e. ""here is a gene family that seems quite divergent between prokaryote lines, but HEEEEY: here's how different it is to metazoa""). Using that database exclusively for the metazoan component seems baffling, given that either of the other two produced by that group [https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-S6-S3](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-S6-S3) (hovergen or homolens) would have been far, far more apposite.  
&gt;  
&gt;The same criticisms could be levelled at the other dataset choices. If you use datasets with mixed-bag organisms from a variety of widely-spaced clades, you will get odd results. Garbage in, garbage out. This tells you not much about biology, but a lot about the integrity or understanding of the author.  
&gt;  
&gt;3) EvolSim: it's nice he used this, but it also has to be taken in context with the above observation. Evolsim generates nested gene trees of descent, and generates COMPLETE nested trees of descent (i.e. all the descendants are related to an ancestral species, and all that ancestral species' descendants are present). This is nothing like the biological datasets used. A more appropriate methodology would be to run evolsim until it generated a hundred thousand or so descendant species, and then to pick 50 or so at random, thus sampling from widely divergent clades. A converse test (which would have been really nice too) would have been to apply his biological analysis to a dataset of closely-related animals (ideally, ones that even creationists accept are related, like cats or horses).  
&gt;  
&gt;3) Gene families: I have never read such a nebulous and ill-defined variable as 'gene families' are in this paper. He seems to switch between genes and gene families as if they are interchangable (they're not), and it is entirely unclear what the author has defined as a family or whether that definition has been applied to all datasets equivalently. The implication is that he has made a case-by-case assignation approach for each dataset, without attempting to place this assignation within a rational biological framework. He also *specifically* states that he is disregarding sequence information, which is astonishingly bold and also utterly unforgivable. Humans, gorillas and E.coli all have cytochrome C, but comparison of sequence would show that human and gorilla CytC genes are near-identical, while E.coli is massively different. Without a consistent application of 'gene family', grounded in biological reality, the comparisons he makes are largely meaningless.  
&gt;  
&gt;4) Modules, dataset annotation and supplementary data: this is a biggie, so bear with me. The concept of 'modules' is an interesting one, but again presented devoid of biological context: the figure suggesting ""echolocation"" could be a module is very, very simplistic, and the suggestion that echolocation involves a family of genes unique to both bats and dolphins is actively wrong. Some background reading [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02057-0](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02057-0) [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12511](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12511)  
&gt;  
&gt;The convergent evolution in this instance is the finding that a few genes, specifically concerned with hearing, that have a few specific sites that confer greatly enhanced sensitivity to high frequencies, and that those sites have been independently found by multiple lineages of echolocating mammals. Firstly this shows that mutations can absolutely add functionality to genes (hearing higher frequencies should count as a gain, right?), secondly it shows that these mutations can be empirically identified and distinguished from other, non-function altering mutations (which accumulate in *all* lineages, both echo- and non-echo locating, in a pattern consistent with inheritance), and thirdly, *all of these genes are present in both echolocating and non-echolocating lineages*, which means the sequence-independent family system employed by Ewert *wouldn't even spot this*. Humans have prestin. Dogs have prestin. Bats have prestin. Whales have prestin. *Zebrafish* have prestin. In layman's terms, most biological innovations are modifications of stuff that is already there, NOT addition of unique functional modules.  
&gt;  
&gt;What, then, ARE these modules he proposes? Well, we don't know, because all he lists are things like ""10 gene families are unique to dogs and cows"". He doesn't tell us what those gene families are, not whether the members of that 10-family 'module' suggest any functional interaction. What that 'module' is, basically, is '10 random genes that couldn't be located in the other (limited) metazoan datasets studied'. Probably (again, he doesn't provide any detail). This is bad, bad bad bad, and also suspicious. I don't know whether it's because he doesn't know enough biology to consider this, or because he doesn't want to show it (because 'mixed bag of random genes').  
&gt;  
&gt;And here's the rub: most of these datasets are incomplete. We can sequence genomes, and we can do it well. We usually do so by fragmenting the DNA into millions of short pieces, sequencing them all, and then stitching them back together by alignment. This works really well, but not perfectly, and it also tells you nothing about the functional context of the sequence. Genes within that sequence can be identified computationally (with reasonable success), manually (usually by groups interested in that specific gene, looking for homologues), or by comparison with already identified genes in other organisms. There will almost ALWAYS be some genes in each genome that simply haven't been found (yet). If I were to compare the chicken genome, the mouse genome and the zebrafish genome, I would expect at least a hundred genes to be present in two but not three of the genomes, purely through incomplete annotation. When you consider that these species have some 20000 genes (by implication, 19900 of which are found in all three genomes), this spurious significance vanishes into sampling noise. If I compared mus musculus, mus macedonicus and mus famulus, I would ALSO expect to find around a hundred genes shared by two but not three of the genomes, and I hope we both agree that all three of those are unarguably related (they are all mice). Because he doesn't provide any information as to the 'gene families' that are not shared, it is impossible to query his claims. He even claims (thanks to Hogenom, the dataset that, again, is aimed at prokaryotes) that Zebrafish and Zebrafinches have nineteen unique shared gene families. Aside from being impossible to check (and thus most probably incorrect), this is demonstrably nonsense biologically. What on earth would such a module DO? Is he proposing those 19 gene families are responsible for 'zebra-ness'? Why are those 19 gene families not also shared with ACTUAL zebras?

t1_ffqm6r3,t3_es00mw,"No humans and chimpanzees have the same number of chromosomes (technically) but in humans two of them are fused end to end.

Repeating yourself when you’re wrong about the 84% is dishonest. I’ve shown you with multiple links and in my own response to you that comparing gene sequences that give a phenotypical difference the difference barely over 1%. By comparing everything like pseudogenes, endogenous retroviruses, gene duplication and the fusion of two  chromosomes into one there is a 96% similarity. I’m not even sure where you got the 84% figure from because you didn’t provide any sources. 

When looking for myself I found sources showing that mice are between 85 and 90% the same as us comparing just the coding genes that provide the phenotypical differences but when comparing the entire genome like pseudogenes, gene regulation, genes shifting from one chromosome to another, and events altering the number of total chromosomes the differences climb all the way to 50% between both lineages.

Now comparing the part that matters when discussing expressed phenotypical traits, we are 98.8% the same as chimpanzees, around 98.4% the same as gorillas, 96.7% the same as orangutans, 93% the same as Rhesus monkey, 90% the same as a mouse, 84% the same as a dog, 80% the same as a cow, 60 the same as a chicken, 30% the same several species of fungi. It also does provide a unexpected levels of similarity when we look to organisms that diverged from our lineage earlier like flies who show 61% gene similarity and banana plants that are still 60% the same. 

However, it’s more than just the whole genome similarity or the coding gene similarity that matters because it is the patterns of similarity that really paint a picture that can only be explained by common ancestry. All mammals have a gene, the same gene for making vitamin C. In dry nosed primates and in humans this gene is nonfunctional, meaning we can’t make our own vitamin C, because of the same mutation at the same location. Once this mutation occurred some twenty five million years ago, these genes have accumulated more mutations, which isn’t a problem when the genes no longer serve a function. In another animal that can’t make vitamin C either, it is a different mutation that prevents them from doing it.

We also have endogenous retroviruses consistent with our evolutionary history that follow the same pattern as I mentioned above where the most closely related groups have more of them in the same locations than more distantly related groups. If they don’t serve any useful function they accumulate mutations and these mutations that they contain follow the same pattern where only closely related organisms have the same mutations at the same location. 

The mutations match up this way with coding genes as well, but by the time we compare humans and chimpanzees we have the same genes located in the same location on the same chromosome but still about 400 million differences across the 3 billion base pairs making the difference around 1.2%. That’s still a lot of differences, but considering there are even more than that comparing chimpanzees to gorillas, there’s clear evidence that chimpanzees and humans are more related to each other than either is related to the other apes.

We can do this for every clade with at least two living organisms whose lineages diverged at that point in history providing much of the same as what I was doing here with us and chimpanzees. Comparing us to gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, colobus monkeys, new world monkeys, lemurs, rodents, Laurasiatherians (dogs, cats, cattle, whales), Atlantogenata (elephants, aardvarks, elephant shrews), Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and so forth paints the same picture. We are most related in a literal sense to organisms at the beginning of that list than those near the end (though I may have Atlantogenata and Xenarthra swapped or they may have diverged from Boreoeutheria before diverging into those two groups from there). Something like this - how those two clades arose and the order in which the divergence occurred, is mostly where evolutionary biology has turned to.

Presumably the viruses themselves have to be made *de novo*, because they'd otherwise entropy even if they were just ticking over in some accommodating conventional host reservoir, so...surely this should totally be a thing creationists make a bigger deal out of?

Here you have a falsifiable, testable hypothesis that would strongly support the claims of 'genetic entropy in viruses', and falsifiable, testable hypotheses are pretty slim on the ground in creationist circles, so I would imagine you should be promoting it strongly.

Wrong.

A) DNA is proposed as a later addition to the replicating, mutating, selecting repertoire (this whole thread concerns the RNA world hypothesis, remember)

B) configurations that permit replicative advantage will be MASSIVELY favoured over those that do not, and this is absolutely a natural law

So: poorly-replicating RNA oligomers will be overwhelmingly favoured over non-replicating RNA oligomers. Natural law. Some will mutate (natural law), and some mutated progeny will be better at self-replicating. They will be favoured over poorly-replicating ones (natural law) and so on, so forth.

t3_etledc,t3_etledc,"Excellent write up. *Really* nicely pitched. 

This bit in particular I feel needs more emphasis for any creationists reading:

&gt; Sanford’s argument *assumes* special creation because it *requires* an optimal “starting point” from which everything inevitably decays. That’s not what we see. Every genome has existed right on this knife’s edge, forever. 

Not just because Sanford does it, but because a lot of mathematical models by actual evolutionary scientists tacitly make this assumption, too.

The starting point for any given simulation of evolution is *not* an optimal genome, or even a reasonably good one. The nucleotides at any given locus should not be be assumed to be initially 'correct', and on the face of it, the very concept of a 'correct' nucleotide is itself a category error. 

The starting point for ongoing evolution should be the ""just good enough"" dumpster fire that all extant genomes are (and all ancestral genomes always have been).

The starting point for stuff closer to origins territory can be *even worse than that*, because as you note, the competition is always what else is around, and if what else is around is wholly non-functional, any function, no matter how bad, will be selected. And from there you swiftly evolve upward to the equilibrium point.",1580123391
t1_ff6z0bm,t3_es00mw,"Because that would be a violation of the fundamental basis of evolution. It’s more like distant cousins of the same kind of organism also being different enough to classify them into more exclusive categories. 

It’s like comparing long haired German Shepard dogs to short haired ones or living humans with light skin to those with dark skin. The differences at first will be very minor in the overall scheme of things but without taking into account genetic similarities and how sometimes they can both come from the same parents we might group them into different categories. 

More significant differences might be in the different breeds of cats, dogs, horses, and cattle where living humans don’t have many examples of this for this level of classification to have much of a meaning for us.

More significant differences build up on top of what is already there so that we have domestic dogs and wolves being members of the same species but categorized as different subspecies. The same thing occurs with other populations like the Darwin finches or by comparing us to Homo sapiens idaltu or time a more extreme example by comparing us to neanderthalensis where we could both be either classified as subpopulations of Homo heidelbergensis or as different species. Either way we’re talking about more isolated groups. By some criteria they’d be the same species but for other criteria they have some justification for classification as different species. 

More of the same eventually makes it so any offspring between the groups would be infertile with a transition between this and full fertility being observed where it might depend on which sex comes from which species for the offspring to also be fertile because of the species are swapped between the parents the hybrid can’t make any babies of its own. In other populations of organisms this doesn’t help much for these first few levels of classification because many groups produce asexually, only produce via hybrids, or they survive through parthenogenesis or hermaphroditism. For these groups genetic and morphological similarities are used more often than some criteria that doesn’t apply to them. 

For any level above genus in sexually reproducing organisms, there usually isn’t any interbreeding anymore at all. All of the higher classifications are based more on the time since their shared ancestors were still inter-fertile or possibly even the very same organism in some extreme cases and this is worked out through genetics mostly but can also be observed in how their embryos start out developing almost the same but differ in some key areas to tell us a bit more about the order in which the mutations occurred that are found in differences in the DNA, and when we are lucky enough to find them, transitional fossils paint the same picture. Genetics alone provides more evidence for common ancestry than can be attributed to separate ancestry, unless they were also identical enough we couldn’t tell them apart and they coincidentally had the same mutations occurring in precisely the same locations at the same time until they finally took their more recent forms. The evidence refutes the idea that dogs, cats, and humans were created fully formed on the same day. However the branching tree of life based on all of the evidence ever obtained and depicted within the phylogeny is the strongest evidence there ever was for common ancestry which is backed by genetics, embryo development and the fossil record. 

Nothing every transforms in a way that it is no longer the same kind of organism as its parents, but distant relatives (like 124^th cousins nine times removed) will start to show defining characteristics of belonging to different more exclusive categories and one of the categories has a label called “species” so that the origin of species is nothing like a fish giving birth to an amphibious that gave birth to a lizard that gave birth to dimetrodon that gave birth to gorgonopsid that gave birth to a shrew that gave birth to a colobus monkey that gave birth to a chimpanzee that gave birth to humans. Most of these lineages are sister groups to our own even if we could take a picture of ever mother of a mother of a a mother for the last six hundred million years and then to a page at random and find some noticeable similarities with their cousins living at that time.",1580122287

Euarchontaglires and Laurasiatheria split before the death of the non-avian dinosaurs with scrotatheria leading to fareungulata to farae to carnivores and eventually to dogs on that side of the split. The shared clade containing all of us is called boreoeutheria. Within Euarchontaglires, glires leads to rodents and rabbits with mice being on the rodent side of that split. More genetic similarity between us and mice than between us and dogs. A more recent split occurring around the time of the KT extinction event that killed the dinosaurs. Within euarchonta we have primates and plesiadapiformes, within primates we have wet nosed primates like lemurs, within dry nosed primates we have monkeys. We are monkeys. Within that we have old world and new world monkeys, all apes like us are old world monkeys and then among the apes, gibbons are lesser apes while gorillas, chimpanzees and humans are great apes. Hominidae is the great apes containing gorillas, humans, chimps, and orangutans while a subset of that called homininae contains gorillas, chimps, and humans but not orangutans which fall into the genus Pongo. The genus Gorilla splits from that leaving us chimps and humans in hominini and when panina split from hominina about six million years ago we are the only ones still around on our side of the split. What to we find? Almost 99% identical with members of hominini, about 98% across homininae, 96% across hominidae, 93% across all monkeys, 90% across euarkontaglires and 84% across boreoeutheria justifying the clades traditionally based on morphology.

Again, these percentages are based on the part that deals with morphological differences. If you compare the entire genome, the entire differences are a bit more like I shared for chimpanzees being only about 96% similar by whole genome comparison and mice only 50% but most of these differences don’t have a whole lot to do with morphological differences, and we expect and find an increased number of differences when they don’t result in major morphological changes than we find when they do. Genes that have no effect on survival are not exposed to natural selection and mutations pile up and persist more often in non coding regions than in the regions responsible for making proteins.

Here’s another link: http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics

Again, much of the same.

t1_ffpjrna,t3_es00mw,"If you look at the entire human and chimpanzee genomes the similarity is 96%

The 98.8% is the part that matters for phenotypical traits, but by comparing the entire genome we are still quite similar. The main differences are how we have defective genes still functional in chimps like those for the large chewing muscles and a tumor suppressor gene still present in us but not functional and the NOTCH 2L genes responsible for brain neuron development are the result of a copy paste error so that we have something like three copies of a gene chimps only have one of. On top of this we have a couple myostatin genes that also have some effect on our muscles. Then we have less thick and long body hair, and arched feet in place of their grasping feet, and we have an Achilles’ tendon not present in chimps. And then with the differences leading to more dedicated bipedalism and our smashed together chromosome 2A and 2B creating a single chromosome out of two complete with extra telomeres in the middle and an inactivated centromere still present, but otherwise the gene sequences across chromosome two are nearly identical as if you stuck both of their chromosomes end to end. 

All of these differences are what makes us human. These differences are also traceable to genetics and the fossil record as the lice that effects our heads and the lice that might inhabit our genitals are different species of lice - head lice is related to chimpanzee body lice and pubic lice is related to gorilla lice showing that by three million years ago, when Australopithecus afarensis was alive, our lineage was already a mostly naked ape. The whole sequence from Sahelanthropus to Homo were dedicated bipedal animals but all the way up to Ardipithecus they still spent at least some of the time in trees, though the mobility in our grasping feet was already being lost in favor of a straight foot as in other mammals but ours also became arched. Australopithecus afarensis had feet, pelvis, and other features almost exactly halfway, and they are also dated to have lived almost exactly halfway between Sahelanthropus and modern humans. From there most of the differences were the increasing size of the Achilles’ tendon already present in Australopithecus and the the further reduction in muscle mass in favor of a larger brain, though microcephaly and mutations resulting in twice the muscle mass and half the fat have happened since. 

The entire genome is 96% the same. Your 84% might apply to more distantly related apes, but you should correct your understanding if you think this applies to the similarity between us and chimpanzees. I used the gene sequence similarity, because those are responsible for the phenotypical traits and are a better measure of relatedness though the 96% similarity is even more evidence for common ancestry when you consider how most of that is junk DNA like broken genes in us that still work in them. 

If you extend this out to mice, there’s still a 90% similarity in the gene sequences and only a 50% similarity if you compare the entire genome of each. Some major differences with this is how all primates use the same gene regulation called Alu while mice use B/ID as they are both based on SINE gene regulation based on A to I gene regulation found in almost all eukaryotes but this one difference between us and mice is dated to about 65 million years ago, around the time the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct. We share a lot of homologies with mice, but obviously not nearly as many as we share with all primates, especially the old world monkeys, and especially the apes, and all of the evidence in genetics shows more and more relatedness the closer we get to our more recently originated clades - and as alluded to in the previous comment, we were so similar to neanderthalensis that we evidently interbred with them. Even with this ability, sapiens and neanderthalensis were distinct populations emerging out of Homo heidelbergensis where the lineage leading to neanderthalensis also led to denisova following that split where our side of that split was rhodesiensis getting so similar to what we find in the modern humans living now in the same location that we are clearly part of the same group. I don’t know the genetic similarity percentages between us and the most closely related groups within our own genus but all living humans are 99.5% genetically identical despite the noticeable phenotypical differences. In this case, I think this is whole genome similarity and not just gene sequence similarity. 

Without “cherry picking” out the part of the genome effected by natural selection and phenotypical differences, the same pattern is seen as what I alluded to last time. But, obviously, there is going to be very little selection to preserve useless junk so the mutations in them pile up and get passed on more often as there is at least the possibility of death or infertility if the coding genes change too drastically too fast. So as expected a 10% difference in 65 million years in coding genes equates to a 50% difference across the entire genome but when the coding genes are still barely more than 1% different, the entire genome differences are only about 4% showing that these differences between our lineages occurred more recently because of a more recent split between us and chimpanzees than there is between us and mice. Based on molecular clock dating in this case, the split between us and chimpanzees is correlated to the lifetime of Sahelanthropus and the rest of the sequence from that to us are where all of the human traits chimpanzees don’t have are found in us - the entire 4% difference occurring in about 6 million years.  The half of a percent difference in living humans occurred within 350,000-500,000 years with the oldest anatomically modern human fossil specimens dated within that range. 

We’ve also dated the the point that many of these differences occurred in our only lineage and not in the chimpanzee lineage such as the one leaving us a mostly naked ape being dated to around 3 million years ago, and the one effecting our increased brain mass coinciding with our loss of massive chewing muscles correlating time the time of Homo erectus which were already starting to look strikingly human in comparison to all other apes up to that time. And still they weren’t quite there yet as further changes occurred since with several other known lineage splitting away from our own since such as a dozen subspecies of Homo erectus and a handful of subspecies of Homo heidelbergensis even though our classification system currently classifies the descendants of that as different species like sapiens, neanderthalensis, and denisova. And then within sapiens there are a couple more subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens idaltu. 

And with the extinction of all of the side branches on our side of the split from the human-chimp ancestor and all but two on their side of the same split, there’s a more more noticeable difference between us and them than what we find within the extinct transitional forms and distant cousins on our side of that split. Even with all of these noticeable differences, the entire genome is still 96% identical where the part of that which provided the phenotypical differences being contained in a subset of the entire genome which is found to be about 98.8% identical across both lineages. Even with this, chimpanzees are even more genetically distinct from gorillas than they are from us because this 98.8% similarity with us is only 98.2% similarity comparing chimpanzees to gorillas.

&gt;Yes angular momentum is real and conserved, I chose my words poorly, but would be interfered with by flows moving up and down as well as north and south. These certainly confound the extremely simplistic views put forth in the article expecting a system with no other influences.

No it doesn't. Angular momentum is a vector quantity. North-south flows merely makes the angular momentum different from what you would expect using a solid spinning sphere approximation. It is still conserved, since torque on the Sun is negligible. Again, Physics 101 material.

&gt;It gets even worse when you consider the complex magnetic situation and the amount of energy I haven't run the numbers but general kinetic energy of even large system is puny compared to nuclear systems. So the convection of material up (heated material from near fusion) and down (cooled from radiation) should totally dwarf rotational energy particularly when you consider that new energy is created from mass constantly and there was a one time injection of rotation from the initial collapse of the pre-solar gas cloud collapsing from gravity.

Once again irrelevant. Energy is not what is under discussion. Angular momentum is.

&gt;The spin of the sun could be sped up or slowed down and that didn't seem taken into account. This is just like the creationist models of moon dust accretion to estimate and age of the moon that better suits creationist narrative.

t1_ffozmly,t3_eti3z7," After Satan failed to find majority support in heaven, he was expelled and denied significant interaction with heavenly beings (Revelation 12:7–9; Job 1:6–7, 2:1–2). This indicates that limits were placed on his activities just as limits were placed on his annoyance of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:1–3). The forces of evil are permitted to work within the bounds set by God and His plan to bring the reign of wickedness to a just end (Psalm 34:7; Revelation 13:5, 7, 15). Satan’s power over nature is beyond human capabilities (Job 1:12–19; Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7). He has the ability to manipulate diverse organisms as suggested in the account recorded in Job. At that time, Satan was able to induce experimental infection at will (Job 2:7). In understanding the latter phenomenon refer to my first article on the origin of pathogenic bacteria (e.g. staphylococci). It is also fruitful to refer to relatively recent community outbreaks where special environmental and contact conditions were shown to permit mass infection by Staphylococcus to occur.47 These observations may be taken to indicate that Satan possessed advanced knowledge on microbial behaviour and ecology at the time of Job. The Bible also speaks of thorns and thistles arising as a consequence of sin (Genesis 3:18). One possibility is that thorn-like structures arose through directed crossing and mutations, as has been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratory.48 Alternatively, they could have arisen through genetic manipulation. Such unusual  84 JOURNAL OF CREATION 30(2) 2016 || PAPERS outcomes have been achieved through using both classical breeding methods and genetic engineering.49 Genetic engineering involves horizontal transfer of genes. It seems untenable to acknowledge Satan’s great power over nature and his ability to perform the spectacular (Job 1:18–19; Matthew 4:8), which is well in excess of human capabilities, and then argue he cannot match human endeavours in the field of genetic engineering. Satan can alter existing information within limits, and he is at times able to use his human agents to do the unthinkable, as in biological warfare.50 After Satan’s expulsion from heaven, it might be expected that he would disrupt God’s creation and blame Him for the suffering caused, as creative ability is God’s hallmark (Isaiah 42:5, 65:17; Colossians 1:16). One of my basic premises is that pre-existing structures and mechanisms have functioned as prototypes to devise malignant forms. Ingenious combinations and innovations among genetic resources, particularly involving opportunistic organisms, could have facilitated pathogenic organism generation. The emergence of some viruses might represent an engineered result. However, a strategy to detect such occurrences would be difficult if not impossible to devise. Genesis and expression of pathogenic capabilities Virulence, the capacity to cause disease, is not strictly an intrinsic microbial characteristic but includes both microbial and host factors.51 With viruses, which are technically non-living entities, features other than intrinsic characteristics are emphasized.

t1_ffnup7p,t3_es00mw,"I agree that our naming conventions could use a bit of updating and consistency but I think I already explained it. It’s a matter of Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens idaltu being different groups of the same species but without calling them breeds. So we already have subspecies and neanderthalensis and denisova were even more different from us than Homo sapiens idaltu was. It is just easier to classify them as a different species than to write out something like Homo erectus ergaster antecessor heidelbergensis rhodesiensis sapiens sapiens for our group and Homo erectus ergaster antecessor heidelbergensis neanderthalensis for theirs. There are quite a few more subdivisions than were known way back when we were classified as Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and cladists shifted to a more simple Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis to indicate that we’re talking about genetically distinct populations and then with the discovery of Homo sapiens idaltu they brought back Homo sapiens sapiens though now some are starting to question even that naming convention. Of course, if you trace it back further when Homo erectus emerged out of Homo habilis before it also spawned several subspecies outside our own. We could have classified them as a subspecies of Homo habilis and the currently recognized subspecies of erectus as subpopulations of that. 

It’s a constantly branching tree where what we declare to be the species level shifts around for different reasons and where different groups living at the same time might be called subspecies of the same group, it just isn’t practical to keep tacking on another subgroup name to the end of it just because we discover that fertility is maintained in a much larger group than we originally expected. Maybe we could ditch the idea of species entirely unless we can agree on a consistent naming convention that works for all domains. Maybe groups that are more than 99% genetically identical could be where we could declare a group members of the same species and when they achieve 99.5% similarity classify them as subspecies and for even more similarities like 99.9997% that could be our “breeds.” Going in the other direction from this we see than we are something like 98.8% the same as chimpanzees just comparing our gene coding regions and they are 98.2% identical to gorillas comparing the same regions of their DNA. With genetics we can tell more about how closely different groups are related but we don’t necessarily have the tools available to establish genetic similarity when considering the fossilized remains of organisms dead longer than 50,000 years though, in extremely rare circumstances we can establish a greater amount of similarity that can be found comparing just teeth and bones. 

There are some hurdles to overcome here when the clade level naming conventions are based on limited information when it comes to fossils, and are a bit inconsistent already when trying to set a standard for how to declare organisms members of different species only to disagree where to set the boundaries.

Part of the problem that arises from this is our insistence on giving every organism a two or three part scientific name and when it just wouldn’t provide the same level of distinction between different groups if we started higher up in the family tree for the second part of the name given to the group and it wouldn’t provide the detail of “all of these things produce fertile hybrids with each other” if we shift species to a lower, more recent division among that group. You can’t have it both ways and maintain a short label for a distinct population as I showed earlier with shifting the species level all the way up to erectus with some suggestion that while erectus was still alive it too could create hybrids with sister populations living about the same time. It’s only really consistent among extant populations if we ignore all of the extinct intermediates  to where a short name can both identify a group as unique among the larger population while still making it clear about which populations can still produce fertile offspring like with Canis lupus lupus and Canis lupus familiarus for wolves and domestic dogs and then among those groups we can assign breeds to further distinguish one population from the next within the same subspecies without tacking on extra words to the scientific classification used for the whole group.

Of course, tracing our lineage back further yet, beyond the level of genus we don’t necessarily need to establish every single division along the way like I showed here from habilis to us and neanderthalensis. We may not even know what the common ancestor was if we either can’t find a fossil for the transition or if multiple different populations could be the species we are looking for. Usually when a clear ancestor descendant relationship isn’t known but they’re known to be part of the same group they’ll be classified as part of a sister clade instead. Even if we did establish that one particular population is ancestral to the entire clade isn’t isn’t practical to classify their direct descendants as subspecies and the descendants of those as subspecies of that and so on. It’s just easier to establish the point of divergence, identity the common ancestor of the whole group, and give that group a distinctive name like hominini, homininae, hominidae, “ape”, “old world monkey”, “monkeys,” “dry nosed primates”, primates, euarchonta, euarchontaglires, boreoeutheria, placentalia, eutheria, zatheria, holotheria, tribospenida, theria, mammal, therapsid, cynodont, synapsid, reptiliamorphs, tetrapods, stegalocephalians, sarcopterygii, osteichthyes, gnathostomes, vertebrates, chordates, etc. It is far easier to establish the ancestral group than every single species or every single organism along the way to becoming human in this case.

I regularly share the most recent video of the systematic classification of life as it comes out. I’ve shared more of them in r/evolution than in this debate sub. That series should explain everything you need to know for the evolution of molecules to man (if you count abiogenesis as part of this process) and for anything overlooked, scientific papers and the vertebrate paleontology series should provide you with whatever information is missing. It may not better justify our naming convention than I already attempted to here, but the names are less important than the evolutionary developments and the branching tree pattern of diversity providing us a reason to recognize each of the clades we still belong to. At the end of each video he builds upon the previous as for why we are still members of the clade in question, except in the first video where he mostly discusses what could reasonably be considered the root of the tree of life as the three domains of eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea with viruses being not quite alive and an example of DNA containing chemical systems that don’t fit the requirements to even be classified along with us in biota (or all life). The side branches that split from what eventually led to us are other examples of evolution being the mechanism by which diversity arises through speciation.",1580072464

t3_eu8zcr,t3_eu8zcr,"Well, the moon is moving away at a rate that would take 10 billion years to get to where it is now from the surface of our plant. 3.8 centimeters a year and a distance of 38.44 billion centimeters away. 

This rate, if consistent would be a problem for the proposed explanation for how our planet has a moon because of a collision 4.5 billion years ago, which is less than half that time but it would be an even bigger problem for their argument for a young Earth moon system as they tend to say something about there not being enough time to explain the moon existing even based on that theory as we could trace the speed of recession in reverse and the moon should have been sitting on the surface of the planet less than a billion years ago. I think they forgot to add a zero.

Also, there is other evidence for the length of time in a day and the rate at which the moon was moving away from us. It would seem to suggest that the rate it was moving away was even slower in the past, but this would only matter if it formed on the surface of the planet instead of out in space a fraction the distance away from us that it is now from the debris caused by that collision that was orbiting our planet before it coalesced into a moon. It’s a prime example of cherry picking the data and failing at simple division.

I’m not sure why the angular momentum of the sun matters but this could easily be explained by tidal forces from the planets. The same type of tidal forces that cause the same side of the moon to face our planet all the time. As the planets move slowly around the sun, gravity slows down the rotation of the sun. And with lighter mass abject than the sun causing this effect it would take a substantial amount of time, which is inconsistent with a young Earth just as much as their other argument about the recession of the moon.",1580070493

One example of this with the almost opposite problem is E. coli where none of them produce sexually but the genetics suggest they should be over a dozen different species based on the level genetic diversity. 

It is also about the offspring also being fertile when fertility is used as a marker for determining species because horses, zebras, and donkeys produce infertile hybrids. Something like this usually is enough to classify them as the same genus but the African cape dogs and domestic dogs can’t interbreed are all. 

Like I said before this naming convention is based on our human instinct to categorize and when talking about just one or a handful of generations between organisms the differences are not enough so that even if their descendants do eventually diverge into different populations we’d still classify everything on the edge of this point in time where the isolated groups lose this ability to breed as members of the parent species or group. When we don’t know exactly which individuals are ancestral we can still compare the genetic similarities of their descendants to find the point of divergence and classify them as members of the same clade as whatever happens to be ancestors and cousins to them.

Another way of putting this is that Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis are different genetically distinct populations and could just as easily be different subspecies of Homo heidelbergensis as they could be different species in the same genus though historically neanderthalensis has been classified as a subspecies of sapiens instead where another group, idaltu, is close enough to us to be more consistently accepted as subspecies of sapiens.

Intelligent design is creationism with new terms. This has been demonstrated with evidence. You can switch the terms and the arguments are the same. You don't have to keep lying to yourself about this anymore.

The evidence for evolution is overwhelming. But based on your rebuttal, I can see how you invent excuses to ignore that evidence.

By your argument, no one should ever be convicted of a crime because the judge, jury and lawyers involved didn't witness the crime. After all, how can they prove that it happened since they weren't there to see it?

""You didn't see it happen"" is a cop out from creationists.

Also, how is the fusion lending credibility to a designer or engineer doing this? No explanation given.

The fusion point is at telomeres on both ends. The chromosome has a vestigial centromere. Human chromosome 2 lines up with markers of two great ape chromosomes. All of that doesn't matter to you because someone didn't witness the fusion.

Do you understand how intellectually dishonest your rebuttal is?

&gt; The problem with your horses is that it lends the possibility it did happen with humans. But you again CAN'T Prove it. Since the ""common ancestors"" died out, we haven't seen it (or I am not aware of it. I will retract this point if it can be proven this did occur.) To prove this point, you would need to show either through simulation or experiment that this hybrid is able of interbreeding with itself or with either of the two different species.

Done: https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msn239

&gt; Furthermore, based on your first article, it contends that indeed the domestic and Przewalski's horses are closely related, but I don't see how you can claim when they branched off.

They have different number of chromosomes, and there are numerous genetic differences in the X chromosome between the two species (same paper). They are closely related but distinct populations.

&gt; And again. You would need to prove that this fusion did not change the functionality. If I take the wheel off the car, and fuse it to another wheel, it doesn't mean the car can go. I could have fused it perpendicularly to the wheel. That would be bad

We have the genes from our chromosome 2 and the two great ape chromosomes which fused into chromosome 2. Since the fusion point was in the telomeres, no genes were lost in the fusion. There you go.

It is several generations onward that distant cousins start to accumulate differences from each other, especially if the genes don’t blend back together on the population level across both groups. When this happens, us humans with a knack for categorizing organisms will see how group A had traits not found in group B. If they are sufficiently different enough by this time, especially if they can no longer produce fertile offspring they get classified as different species. If several of these “speciation” events occurred in the past based on morphological and gene comparison they are separated by that many clades since their common ancestor. The system isn’t perfect such that just within our own genus there may be five or six intermediates like Homo heidelbergensis before neanderthalensis and sapiens parted ways and this is another example of how categorization doesn’t alway reflect genetic isolation as accurately as you suggested where it would be always impossible for different species to produce fertile offspring because most humans alive today have the genetic evidence to establish that neanderthalensis and sapiens hybrids could, at least sometimes, be fertile.

All organisms are a member of a species. They arent a member of two or three species, just one. They can only interbreed within a single species.

Therefore, any particular organism either IS or ISNT homo sapiens. 

Therefore, at the moment that an organism is born, it either IS or ISNT homo sapiens

You believe that at one point in time no homo sapiens existed. And now they do, so logically you must believe that at SOME POINT the very first homo sapiens was born. Where is this homo sapien? 


here, let an evolutionist explain why you are wrong:
----------------------
""I had visited every state but Idaho. A few months ago, I finally got my opportunity to complete the roster of 50 by driving east from Spokane, Washington, into western Idaho. As I crossed the state line, I made the same feeble attempt at humor that so many of us try in similar situations: Gee, it doesn’t look a bit different from easternmost Washington. 

We make such comments because we feel the discomfort of discord between our mental needs and the world’s reality. Much of nature (including terrestrial real estate) is continuous, but both our mental and political structures require divisions and categories. We need to break large and continuous items into manageable units. 

Many people feel the same way about species as I do about Idaho-- but this feeling is wrong. Many people suppose that species must be arbitrary divisions of an evolutionary continuum in the same way that state boundaries are conventional divisions of unbroken land. Moreover, this is not merely an abstract issue of scientific theory but a pressing concern of political reality. The Endangered Species Act, for example, sets policy (with substantial teeth) for the preservation of species. But if species are only arbitrary divisions in nature’s continuity, then what are we trying to preserve and how shall we define it? I write this article to argue that such a reading of evolutionary theory is wrong and that species are almost always objective entities in nature."" --- Stephen Jay Gould.",1580053308

t1_ffl319v,t3_entwuz,"There isn’t nearly the crisis you make it out to be. Most of the extended evolutionary synthesis is already incorporated into the modern synthesis but it’s more of a testable hypotheses to see if certain aspects of biology play a larger role in evolution than we generally give them credit for like niche construction, for example. The fact that evolution happens is still a fact and it’s been observed happening no matter how far we zoom in on the genetics or how far back we observe the trends of a population. We’ve even seen new genes that cause a new function previously unseen or unnecessary until recent times. We’ve even seen the effects of artificial selection and even felt the effects of natural selection on top of observations of genetic drift, heredity, and speciation. 

The biggest deal with extended evolutionary synthesis is whether it in necessary as the current theory is already constantly updating the data or if it is actually a new revolutionary revision to how we look at evolution that we already know is happening. 

This is how science works - everyone always trying to one up everyone else by finding holes in our theories that they try to explain or by establishing whole new revolutionary fields of study.

&gt; https://answersingenesis.org/bible-history/is-josephus-reliable/


Lol, did you even read the link you cited? 

Here's the money quote:

&gt; &gt; Yet Josephus was not an eyewitness to most events in his works. His history is only as good as his sources. The early history in The Antiquities of the Jews is far removed from his own personal experience. We can only be sure of the details that coincide with Scripture, but the others are no more trustworthy than the traditions he relied upon.

First, it  points out that Josephus was not an eyewitness. We know this for one critical reason beyond his writings themselves:  *because Josephus wasn't even born until after Jesus death.*

You are just flat misinformed if you believe that there are *any* eyewitness reports of the key events of Jesus life or death, either in the bible or in any extra-biblical sources. Even the gospels themselves were not written by eyewitnesses. The earliest of the gospels was written in approximately 70AD, by an unknown author. 

In fact the only actual claim of anything even resembling eyewitness testimony are the writings of Paul, who does not claim to have met Jesus or witnessed any of the key events of his life. His only claim is to have had Jesus appear to him after his death. 

It is fucking amazing to me how many Christians lack even the most basic knowledge of the history of the book that they claim to believe. How on earth can you claim to believe this is true when you lack even the awareness that it was written decades after the events by people who did not witness them?",1580030635

t1_ffhgs4f,t3_eseb2k,"&gt;You don't want to know. 

This is not a sound argument. It's an ad-hom and an attempt to justify your lack of a convincing case, but it is not an actual case even if it were true. Also, it's false, and it's intrinsically about personal, internal motives that people are particularly bad at reading in others. Interestingly, one of the things that research has shown makes it difficult to see things from the perspective of others is ... fear. Huh!

As it stands right now,

\- I'm unconvinced of the ID conspiracy theory you're promoting, and

\- I'm unconvinced that it would call for a substantial change in mentality or in behavior even if it were true.

I'm unconvinced of the first because I think it's adequately explained by the motives they're claiming, which are not, when you look at them closely, an aim of Literally Killing Science or ushering in theocratic hegemony.

(Incidentally, the idea that religion and science are perpetually locked in an existential crisis that will kill one of them, is about 90% fabricated myth that was popular for a few decades before it was contradicted by scholarly research in the 1970's. Did you know that? I think a lot of anti-theists have not caught all the way up to yet.)

On the other hand, I am pretty sure well-convinced that fear makes it harder for a person to understand others, and easier to be controlled or deceived into less-than-rational decisions. This is an observation that has been made repeatedly, in various contexts, with fairly robust amounts of documentable rigor, for hundreds of years... is this something that you are skeptical of, or do we agree that's the case?

&gt; Seems to me that if anyone is scared, it's Creationists 

I have seen many creationists who are scared. It's clear from the Wedge Document that fear is present there. To be operating from a position of fear, would be a harmful thing for those ID proponents, don't you agree?

And yet ... it's not rational to look at fear as if it's something that only one side or the other has, or that the aim is to merely have less fear than the other side, right? If fear suppresses healthy reasoning, and if we want our reasoning to operate at its best, then fear is something we want to avoid as much as possible, isn't it? It's not a contest of which ""side"" can do so less than the ""other"", it's just a good way to be.

Understanding others--getting ""in their brain""--is crucial for learning and persuasion. Fear, anxiety, stress, and uncertainty makes it harder to do that. If you find yourself in a discussion with someone who you can tell is afraid, one of the best gifts you can offer is to model vulnerable courage and acknowledge shared values, because this can help those with whom you disagree to ease out of ""defensive"" mental mode and into one that is open to growth in understanding and learning. It's just a good way to be.",1580026166

t1_ffk6j9n,t3_etxl1s,"I’m not a Muslim, but newer scripture contains the understandings of people living more recently. They were already looking at embryos to see what they looked like without a microscope where as the Bible doesn’t discuss this at all. It’s still very wrong about how embryos develop and how it says that mountains stop Earthquakes somehow describing them as pegs or stakes nailing the planet in place. 

Alongside these crazy ideas found in scripture there were very early observations or at least assumptions of the diversity of life being a result of change. Even one guy suggested that a fish sprouted legs and eventually gave rise to people, though his explanation for how this would happen was absurd and didn’t account for DNA or subtle variations and selective pressures accounting for life basically evolving in all directions at once but with lineages that survive (because of various selective pressures) being the origin point for the next subtle change. They also didn’t know very much about deep time, plate tectonics, or stratification way back then either. 

Even though evolution had been suggested something like 2600 years ago, it lost favor at the time to emerging philosophies presented by Aristotle and Plato who themselves didn’t know anything about deep time, geology, or biology to make an accurate assessment. 

This slowly changed in the 1600-1700s as discoveries were made about these various fields of study and when they took note of various trends in biology and stratigraphy like how the rock layers seem to present a sequence of changing environments complete with their own flora and fauna with very simple life forms in the oldest rock layers and more advanced ones like mammals and humans in the most recent layers. To explain this apparent evolutionary trend and the observations, the branching hierarchy tree of life based on morphological similarity, and variability in nature several people people started presenting their hypotheses for *how* life evolves and not *if* it does. Lamarck suggested that giraffes have long necks due to many generations of stretching where Darwin suggested that natural selection and variability were the true driving forces of how life changes. He also suggested that we should find more in between forms in the fossil record describing what to expect and what we found fits his description being almost exactly halfway between two living groups in some cases and between old forms and new forms of the same group of animals for the rest. We should see birds with unfused wing fingers and apes with the gradual loss of the grasping feet in favor of more human shaped feet. We have several of each. That’s where the usual complaints from creationists are either that the changes aren’t drastic enough to count as evolution or they are so drastic that they count as different kinds. 
He didn’t publish his findings until Alfred Russel Wallace came up with essentially the same idea, but his contributions to science weren’t where we just declared the theory complete. It doesn’t stop with Darwin and like most scientific findings, the most recent papers usually have the most up to date information where the oldest make several errors or unsupported guesses. 

And, that’s just a bit of what we’ve learned since the Bible was written so it would truly be miraculous if the Bible got it right since the beginning but of course there’s a problem with accuracy riddled throughout.

People have interpreted “stretching out the heavens” various ways but in context it sounds most like literal stretching like a bedsheet over a mattress or some other material to span a gap like a trampoline surface is pulled right with springs. In this context and by interpreting the events of day two literally that say our planet is covered with a big solid dome the stretching out of the heavens would be like pulling a canvas tight over the dome so that at night we can see the stars as if they are a pattern in the background and not actuality the same thing that our planet orbits around. Another, slightly less liters interpretation would be a stretching of the sky over the planet so that there is an atmosphere allowing us to breath. In either case this god is said to live in heaven, a word that they regularly use to refer to the sky. This changes with astronomy and cosmology so that he doesn’t inhabit any location that we can travel to without being invisible and everywhere at the same time.

Somewhat related to the topic of creation vs evolution is both how Richard Owen suggested multiple creation events in place of evolution and the denial of young Earth creationists that they was ever a time longer than a single day that other life existed without humans being a part of the picture.",1580019587

t1_ffk5wns,t3_etxl1s,"Josephus himself demonstrates how fallible the gospels are. The Pharisees were not hypocrites, as the gospels depict them.

E.P. Sanders, an evangelical Christian one of the most prominent Professors of Judaism, wrote of the Pharisees thus, citing Josephus as one piece of evidence -

&gt; ""Similarly with regard to the Pharisees: others could see their scrupulous definition and fulfilment of the laws as being merely external activity that masked inner hypocrisy and self-righteousness, but they did not themselves see it that way. They thought that God had given them his law and bestowed on them his grace, and that it was their obligation within the loving relationship with God to obey the law precisely.

&gt; How do we know that they saw it this way? Partly by common-sense inferences based on observation of other religious polemic and defences. There are, however, passages that show that Pharisees themselves (and their rabbinic successors) regarded love and devotion to God as standing at the centre of their attempt to obey the law in every detail. According to Josephus many people followed the Pharisees’ rules of worship because they admired their high ideals, expressed ‘both in their way of living and in their discourse’ (Antiq. 18.15). Josephus saw them as being ‘affectionate to each other’, and he said that they cultivated ‘harmonious relations with the community’—unlike the Sadducees (War 2.166). That is, the Pharisees paid attention to the part of the law that says to love God and the neighbour. These passages in Josephus do not precisely describe inner motive, but their general thrust is relevant. Josephus is claiming that the Pharisees were good and kind and that their devotion to God was admired. We should also recall the depth of that devotion, which we summarized above: the willingness to die rather than be false to what they believed.

&gt; Explicit statements about motive come in rabbinic literature. I know of no body of literature that so emphasizes the importance of right intention and pure motive, of acting in a spirit of love and humility. Thus Hillel, in a saying retained in Aramaic: ‘A name made great is a name destroyed’ (Avot 1.13). To Hillel is also attributed this statement: ‘Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving mankind and bringing them nigh to the Law’ (Avot 1.12). According to Hillel’s predecessor Shemaiah, one should ‘love labour and hate mastery’ (Avot 1.10). The Pharisees did not regard themselves as observing the law for the sake of self-glorification.

&gt; The topic of motive, ‘intention’, is even more directly discussed by the post-70 rabbis, making use of the phrase ‘directing the heart’ (to God). The scholar who studies much is not superior to his fellow, the common person, provided that the latter ‘directs the heart to Heaven’ (Berakhot 17a). Similarly the size of an offering does not matter, and all are called ‘an odour of sweet savour’. This is ‘to teach that it is all one whether a man offers much or little, if only he directs his mind towards heaven’ (Menahot 13.11). I do not know of any sayings of this sort that are attributed to pre-70 Pharisees, but rabbinic literature attributes relatively few sayings (as distinct from legal discussions) to pre-70 Pharisees. I propose, however, that here as elsewhere the rabbis were the spiritual heirs of the Pharisees.

&gt; We may conclude that the Pharisees did not see their meticulous definition and observance of the law as being hypocritical and that they were not consciously seeking self-glorification; they were motivated by true religious devotion and the desire to serve God.""

You can introduce more mutations, and two things will happen faster (in the context of ""genetic entropy""). 1) you will hit the ""selection tipping point"" , and 2) you will reach the equilibrium point at which the frequency of good and bad mutations are approximately equal. 

Changing the *rate* at which mutations occurs does affect those two things happening, just how long it takes to reach equilibrium. 

&amp;nbsp;

And separately from the question of ""genetic entropy"", which is, being frank, not a serious idea, I will go further still, though admittedly I haven't done the theoretical nor empirical work to robustly support this position, but I have been convinced that it is the case.

I believe that the underlying theory of causing extinction via mutation *accumulation, over generations* is fundamentally flawed. And let me be clear: A significant portion of my work in graduate school was on that very thing, operating under the opposite paradigm. But I could not make it work, in a system where it should have worked.  [And I'm not convinced anyone else has, either](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bu4h6t/no_error_catastrophe_has_never_been_demonstrated/). Lethal mutagenesis undoubtedly works, as long as you hit the target with enough mutagen to kill of severely damage everyone outright in a single generation. But if you give selection a chance to intervene, it will, and I don't think there's a middle ground where if you have mutations accumulate but the target remains viable, it eventually dies out rather than just resetting to a different equilibrium.

They are based on SINEs and this goes a bit into how this evolved from something they call A to I gene regulation (or something like that) and further development to this basic gene regulation shared by all mammals is what sets us apart from mice but places us firmly within primates. They are the only group that we know of with this specific form of gene regulation, though the counter argument would be that all primates plus this unrelated group containing humans were given the same gene regulation.

Considering that a flipped base pair would have a similar structure, and that a significant number of bases aren't going to be the ones interacting with the reagents in solution (there are only so many interactions on a ribonucleic base a ribozyme can use), the number of permutations increases pretty quick. There's also nothing precluding an entirely different 90 bases.

&gt; I am still assuming 1 sample per second.

90 rxn/sec is really slow. While enzymes are used, DNA replication is as fast as 1000 bases per second with the slow down of error checking mechanisms.

&gt; Are you still assuming only one simultaneous RNA?

Under what scenario would it make sense for RNA polymerization in a pool of reagents that encourages polymerization to only sample one polymer at a time?

&gt; The only observable source of information today, such as that in DNA, is an intelligent mind.

t1_ffjbqwk,t3_etxl1s,"And related even more to mammals is how monotremes still lay eggs that hatch almost immediately and what comes out of them is so underdeveloped and helpless that like marsupial embryos they must latch on and remain with their mothers more directly than any placental mammals ever did. Many marsupials also have a placenta just like us but it is smaller and less developed and kangaroos lack both the yolk sac and the placenta so that their offspring come out just as underdeveloped as monotremes produce with an egg. 

However, since monotremes still lay eggs as well as multituberculates and other evolutionary dead ends just within mammals we can find even more developmental and morphological similarity among all amniotes. Yes, there are skinks that lay eggs and give love birth in the same liter but they do it for a different reason and without the placenta to make up for it. 

Tracing this backwards in our evolutionary history takes us to a time when all amniote tetrapods still laid eggs as do most amphibians and fish but in our lineage amniotic fluid and a shell provided a benefit over the thin permeable membranes of those that can only survive embryonic development of the eggs are released in water or some other sufficiently damp environment. Dinosaurs, like birds and especially birds went the other way as the shells of their eggs became more calcified especially in the larger varieties where most reptiles and including most dinosaurs can lay a whole clutch of eggs but birds lay just one at a time because it lightens the load providing an additional benefit when it comes to flight even if they can can lay one a day and still wind up with a whole clutch of eggs.

The point here is that fossils, genetics, vestigial traits, and even living individuals paint the same picture. Mammals used to lay eggs where the embryos were nourished by yolk just like in reptiles before living mammals gradually shifted away from this towards live birth almost entirely. Even monotreme eggs don’t persist long so that if it wasn’t for them hatching almost right away it shows a trend towards live birth as most therian mammals have a placenta instead, even the marsupials, but in placental mammals gestation lasts longer and the placenta has to accommodate for that, while another lineage split from ours even sometimes losing the placenta as well but in their case having a pouch to store their offspring was better than relying on them to hold onto the hair of the abdomen of their mother. Holding onto hair as a means for survival isn’t nearly as sufficient as being tucked away in a pouch or coming out fully developed so it’s no wonder we only have three species of egg laying mammals left. 

Further mutations to this basic body plan at the point of divergence from their sister clades in each case comes into effect beyond this to explain how shrew shaped animals could give rise to four different lineages of placental mammals that dominate our planet over other varieties mostly seen in Australia. Part of this is found in the way mice and human genes perform nearly the same function and even have 96% amino acid coding similarity in some cases. This is beyond the topic of this post, but for more information I provided a recent post on some of our more recent evolutionary developments and our retention of mammal, primate, and monkey genes and gene regulation styles but with even more mutations accounting for why we don’t look or act exactly like modern chimpanzees or any of the other apes. 

We are reptilomorph amniotes, but we are also mammals, primates, dry nosed primates, monkeys, old world monkeys, apes, hominids, and members of hominidae, homininae, and hominini. More specific than this, and we’re the only ones left but we have Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Homo habilis, erectus, antecessor, heidelbergensis, and rhodesiensis to fill this “gap” between us and chimpanzees. It’s a continuous branching hierarchy where even continuously breeding populations evolve but if they ever become genetically isolated into two or more groups they give rise to ethnic groups, breeds, subspecies, and species slowly growing apart with a potential for hybridization providing us with several “in between” forms as well until the evolutionary divergence makes it nearly impossible to create fertile hybrids at which point continue divergence is inevitably as they eventually can’t interbreed at all and they even start looking like different groups entirely. This is where creationists tend to accept them as the same group if they still look the same as long as humans are in their own group but they won’t or don’t accept the higher levels of classification as evidence of common ancestry. Until they’ll admit we are apes, monkeys, and primates even still it’s going to be hard for them to admit that mammals are amniote reptiliamorphs or walking fish or if they do accept it they won’t include us as part of the group. It won’t allow us to be extra special - and that’s what it boils down to - even if being made in the image of God implies that their god looks like a human, which is a problem for another time.",1580001354

I know defenders of Sanford/Carter, and they themselves like to say that there was a gradual decline of ""fitness"" aka mortality, but that simply isn't the case. They argue that if the decline in deaths from H1N1 were due to advances in medical tech, or similar then we should see a drastic reduction in deaths when said ""tech"" was introduced. As an example of what they think we should see, we can look at data for Chickenpox, for which we have really good year to year data, and can see clear trends which result from advances in medicine. [Graphs here](https://vaccines.procon.org/vaccine-histories-and-impact/varicella-chickenpox/)

However, H1N1 isn't persistent in humans, and Sanford/Carter are really only working with 4 data points during the last century. They want to say the the invention of antibiotics didn't have an effect, because they can't see a direct correlation in their data. However, they have zero, zip, nadda, nothing, no data that covers the period in which the widespread use of antibiotics occurred. 

Penicillin was invented in 1928, and adopted for widespread use soon after. Sanford/Carter would like to convince you that since they don't see a precipitous drop in flu mortality during the 1930's any decline in mortality was due to genetic entropy. The thing is, they don't have any data from the 1930's, or the 40's, or the 20'. They have data from 1918, and from 1955, and **nothing in between** 

Grabbing the first results from Google, I see the the 1918 pandemic killed 150 per 1000 infected. In 1955 that number was 6 per 1000. That's a 25 fold decrease in mortality. Sanford and co would like you to believe that because they have no data the corresponds to the invention of antibiotics, those could absolutely not be the cause.  They would also like you the believe that because they can draw a straight line between 2 points that somehow make their model correct. 

I could make the same argument for chickenpox. Pick a year... 1980-something, and then compare the mortality to today. You'll see the same 30... 50... 100... fold decrease in in mortality. Does that mean chickenpox genetically entropy'd itself into near extinction? No of course not, the drop in mortality is because anyone older then 25 has almost certainly been vaccinated.",1579998601

I have a question. Something I've wondered about for some time:

You're making this argument in general theoretical terms, implying that it would apply regardless of the relevant biological parametres. As in, genetic entropy is inherently a contradiction in terms and therefore cannot ever happen.

Well, suppose you imagine a hypothetical human population, where we artificially raise the mutation rate by increments and observe the consequences. Such that it gradually increases from 100 per person per generation to 200, to 300, to 400 etc.

Are you arguing this population would, every time we ramped up the mutation rate, just settle on a new mutation-selection equilibrium? Ad infinitum? Or would the elevated mutation rate eventually cause a problem, and what would the nature of that problem be?",1579989862
t1_ffikxeq,t3_etjksh,"Are you assuming that that is the only possible sequence?

At this time we don't know the exact function of &gt; 98% of nucleotides in the genome.  Even if we did, the function is [highly redundant](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6131.long), ""such that double or triple disruptions are required for a phenotypic consequence.""

My [Junk DNA article](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna) makes the case that enough of our DNA is functional that we likely receive dozens of deleterious mutations per generation, based on several overlapping evidences of function, even though we usually don't know what specific functions a nucleotide contributes to.

&gt; Do you think there's significant empirical evidence that genomes are generally deteriorating?

I think the process is so slow in large complex animals like us that it's hard to measure.  I have this blurb saved in my notes, but I haven't yet had time to dig through the research behind it:

1.  ""the results suggest that humans are carrying around larger numbers of deleterious mutations than they did a few thousand years ago. But this doesn’t mean that humans now are more susceptible to disease, says Akey.

If we were to group HIV differently, we would have seen some go “extinct”. If the criteria which sorted various genomes  into a “strain” were narrow  enough, at some point due to mutations that met those criteria. I know that might not be self-evident, so I’ll make an absurdist example to demonstrate it. Imagine that a “strain” was defined having a singular and exact genome as the criteria for set inclusion. Only in the case that  mutation from that genome was deleterious would one anticipate that exact genome lasting more than few generations. Any possibility of positive or neutral mutations would mean that the original genome would very quickly becoming increasingly less represented among an ever-increasing number of other (presumably similarly defined) virus genomes. 

Now of course, HIV strains aren’t defined that way. There is considerable genetic variation within a strain. The particular boundaries of what genomes are included in a strain have been rationally developed, but are in some sense still arbitrary. They have been defined as having particular attributes in genotype or etiology, and are defined broadly enough to be useful (having a strain per genome is pointless) for categorization, but narrow enough to allow useful description.

&gt; Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we also remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

&gt; So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.   
after 2: 12/2/16.   
after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)   
One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial.

I want to figure out what you're saying here. 
Let's assume that at that mutated site, A is the original base. With 1 beneficial and two deleterious, lets say that beneficial is A-&gt;T and deleterious is A--&gt;G and A-&gt;C. 

So with one deleterious mutation, A-&gt;C happens. We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (beneficial relative to C),     
C-&gt;T (very beneficial relative to C), and     
C-&gt;G (from one bad thing to a different bad thing)

&gt; So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. 

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 2/1/0

Initially we postulated 1 b and 2d at this site. Now we have 2b and one n. **BUT** the problem is how you are defining things. You're saying that it's beneficial relative to where it is now.  If we look at the original genome and see what it is, we get a different situation:

A bad mutation has happened (A-&gt;C).  We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (neutral relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;T (beneficial relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;G (deleterious relative to the original genome)

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 1/1/1

I have trouble with you defining C-&gt;A as beneficial and C-&gt;G as neutral.  I suspect that if you follow it through using this way of looking at it, you'll end up with quite different results (maybe you or someone could crank this out. I had to actually use 4 specific bases in order to follow what's going on).

This is a problem for two reasons: 

First, if, as they claim, the pre-'09 strains went extinct in '09, then it's completely inappropriate the just add all the mutations together - the '09 pandemic should represent a completely new lineage. 

Second, we know that the '09 pandemic was a reassorted (i.e. recombinant) strain, so most of those differences weren't due to single-base point mutations - they were due to recombination between different strains. Surely Carter and Sanford know this, so it's dishonest of them to treat those changes as though they are due to single-base substitutions accumulating over time.

There was no non-sequitur because when you start with one gene and a mutated form arises now you have two forms and if two new one arise from those now you have for such that a single population having a single version of a gene now has at least for so that diversity is the result. The alternative would be identical clones because of mutation so that every organism was identical so that no diversity existed. This variety is the necessary diversity for natural selection because without it a single environment would kill all of them at once or it wouldn’t have any purifying effect at all. To select you need variety to choose from. These work hand in hand.",1579952241

And going back to the paper myself, the answer is YES, that's exactly what they do. *That's* what figure 2 shows. They're counting cumulative mutations in H1N1 from 1917 *to 2012* across this supposed extinction.

There is no compelling evidence that even the adaptability of e.coli is from 'mutation'.  That is hypothesized. The more likely explanation is the INHERENT ability of bacteria to adapt, by the unique ability of making slight changes to it's enzyme secretion.  Mutations, as a force on EVERY organism,  are deleterious.  They do NOT increase complexity or add functions.  To ascribe to 'mutation!' this ability of ecoli is spurious, at best.  It is an interesting theory, but it is not clearly established that mutation was the mechanism for adaptation, in this specific case.  That is assumed.

Then, to seize upon this study as 'proof of common ancestry!', is a greater leap of faith (and logic).  There is no transitional form being 'created', even after 66,000 generations.  A fruit fly study went to millions of generations, with still no transitional forms being created, under forced laboratory conditions.

Varying enzyme secretion is an inherent trait..  it is not, scientifically,  an example of mutation.   That is a theory, and not a compelling one, imo.

But even if it could be shown that deleterious mutations of genes can occasionally 'help' a bacteria to adapt, which this study does not, it is a leap of faith to conclude 'common ancestry!', via mutation.

t1_ff85yt0,t3_emxcfo,"&gt;The thread title was about genetics as evidence for evolution so thats why your invoking fossils is out of order and you should be making your case on genetics anyways.

You said that the conclusion of Africa being the place of humanity's 
origin was ""wild"". While genetic evidence alone is more than sufficient, such accusations still warrant mentioning some of the evidence.

&gt;As i said variation is relative to need, at least as a option

That would first need to be demonstrated, and yet it never has. And the thing is, many populations of animals with low diversity would greatly benefit from such a mechanism if it existed, and yet they don't. Tests have shown again and again that diversity in a species do not happen you the way you wish it did.

And then fact that most of the diversity in question is non-coding parts and that, as repeatedly stated, the pattern is for what the original human population would look like is ridiculously specific and Africa fits it to a T.

&gt;its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive.

Take a small portion of a larger population of deer and put them in a new environment were they now have limited gene flow with the original population. These deer will only have a portion of the original population's diversity. Now, after the new population has grown did it again. This new population will have even less. Do it again and again and this is exactly what the pattern of human diversity is like. And seeing as how extensive study no other process does the same, calling it suggestive would be an understatement even ignoring the vast amount of fossil evidence..

&gt;Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity to others.

That was nothing to do with diversity. Traits like skin pigment are under selective pressure, and so are of little use Put fair skinned people under conditions and keep them isolated and slowly those with mutations for darker skin will become more common. And that is why such traits are not considered when who is descended from who. It is the parts of the genome that do not code for anything that are.

All you have shown is that you seem lack understanding of what genetic diversity, which is what is being debated about, even is in the first place.

&gt;Finally nothing has shown genetic change comes only, or at all, by mutations. they just presume that because they have no other idea of a mechanism to change dna.

Not ideas, observations. Seeing as how mutation is defined as ""the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, that is the definition. Mutations being a result of only random process or deliberate modification by humans using advanced technology has been repeatably tested, not just assumed and asserted as truth like you do.

&gt; peoples bodyplan differences since the flood is the great obvious evidence. its impossible where we needed some change that only a few offspring got it from mutations and only they created new populations. God would not allow that.

This is a good example of confusing the claim for evidence, which is ultimately all you have done here. You assume a YEC timeline because of what you perceive the Bible to say, and take that as evidence. But the Bible would only be a claim, not evidence. And all you have done is ignore all actual evidence and make things up and claim them as fact.

And Bible isn't even the claim, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, which you quiet tellingly have ignored, in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/emxcfo/whats_the_creationist_explanation_for_these_human/ff2cblf/).

Lol, your boi Sanford is actually looking at swine flu fam.   
Sanford uses A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) as one of two reference genomes for his paper. These sequences were taken from the Christman et al. 2011 paper (erroneously referred to as Kedwaii et al. in Sanford's paper).  H1N1pdm reference strain A/California/04/2009 was classified as genotype  \[C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A\], with a lineage assigned sequentially to each of the eight genomic segments. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus arose from a reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, namely, a North American H1N2 and a Eurasian H1N1, each of which themselves arose from reassortments (Fig. 2) ([Garten et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0100), [Gibbs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0110), [Smith et al., 2009a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0275), [Smith et al., 2009b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0280), [Trifonov et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0315)). The North American swine virus was itself formed by at least two  previous reassortments in swine, contributing six segments: PB2, PB1,  PA, HA, NP, and NS. 

  
The quote from Sanford:

"" We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1  outbreak of 2009–2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. ""

------------------------------------------------------

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

True to the reduced capacity for honesty in creationist circles, /u/PaulDouglasPrice flagrantly disregards 30 instances of the word ""extinct"" in relationship to H1N1 and unabashedly lies about it:   


  

""We document multiple **extinction** events, including the previously known **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.""

""These **extinctions** appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations.""

""Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957, when the human strain went **extinct**.""

""Apart from the 1917 pandemic, H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic, and human H1N1 essentially went **extinct** from 1957–1977.""

""Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual **extinction** of the viral strain.""

""Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (“lethal mutagenesis”) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain **extinction** \[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B25)\-[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B30)\].""

""Others have noted the temporal **extinction** of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""This discontinuity reflects the **extinction** of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s, followed by the re-introduction of the strain in 1976, presumably from a researcher’s freezer.""

""Notice that after re-introduction in 1976, the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the **extinction** occurred in the 1950s.""

""These fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 **extinction**.""

""However, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic (the porcine lineage had no **extinction** event, and hence no pause in mutation accumulation).""

""Human H1N1, the remnant of the 1918 lineage, appears to have gone **extinct** a second time.""

""Before its apparent **extinction** in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations (mostly point mutations), including 320 non-synonymous mutations, compared to the 1918 genotype.""

""This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time, perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as **extinction** approaches.""

""This is only possible if almost **all human influenza** lineages rapidly go **extinct**.""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the **extinction** of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second **extinction** event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. Strain **extinction** has often occurred when new strains appeared, including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3-like strains in 1917, H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957, and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""Our other evidences include: a) the **extinction** of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent **extinction** of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

""Finally, the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline, attenuation, **extinction** of most circulating strains, and even more frequent sub-lineage **extinction** events.""

""These facts, combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain **extinction**, all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.""

""Thus, the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual **extinction**.""

""Based on our mutation count analysis, there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone **extinct**, apparently twice.""

""The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago, and there has been universal **extinction** of all earlier human influenza strains.""

""Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went **extinct** in 1957, but was reintroduced in 1976, apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s.""

t1_ffgw1do,t3_eti3z7,"I'll explain this to you very clearly. They are referring to the specific strain they call the ""human version"" of H1N1, which is frequently called Spanish Flu. It came about in 1917 and went extinct first in the 1950s. It was re-released from containment in the 1970s and then went extinct a second time in 2009. However, in the 1950s the human strain jumped into swine before it went extinct. That swine version made a jump back to humans in 2009, and the mutational load shows a linear progression going all the way back to 1917. So even though the Spanish Flu jumped to pigs and reassorted, it kept accumulating mutations nonetheless. And this is why the 2009 swine flu was very weak compared to many fears. It was already highly attenuated when it jumped back to humans.

t1_ffgtyi8,t3_etjksh,"The word ""information"" is difficult to define without context, and you're playing with that ambiguity to try to make this argument.

In the general sense, information is just what we call it when a something could conceivably exist in multiple states, but that uncertainty has been resolved and it exists in only one of those states. Imagine three rocks in a line on the beach (A, B, and C). Picking a starting point and moving down the line, the order could be any of six sequences: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, or CBA. But even though there are six possible arrangements, the rocks exist in only one of the six. Let's say its BCA. That is information. The existence of information is in no way contingent on an intelligent agent.

You're blurring that with the idea of idea of encoding and decoding information. Systems can take information and encode it into a storage medium. You have already provided two examples: synaptic connections in the brain and cave paintings. Another obvious example is written language. Later on we decode that storage medium to get the information back. You see a tiger, you write ""I saw a tiger"" in a letter and mail it to  me, I read the letter and I know that you saw a tiger. We encoded and decoded information. Even here, there is no basis to assert that says a system needs to be intelligent to encode or decode information. Most life lacks any cognitive ability whatsoever, and they still manage to receive, store, transmit, and respond to information.

You're giving examples of ""encoding information"" but passing them off as if they were ""producing information"". It really doesn't matter which one we look at, except for clarity sake.

Indeed very small *individual* mutations may escape selective pressure. But sooner or later, *many* of them will inevitably surpass the threshold of selective pressure. And then they will be weeded out by selection.

And the funny thing here is that creationists, unknowingly and naively, actually bring in arguments that endorse this: they say that genetic entropy will occur, degrading the genome. But degrading the genome implies that fitness will inevitably decrease. So, to bolster that, Price came up a week ago with many examples of what he thinks happens in humans (all kinds of genetic conditions and the like). But as soon these happen and while such conditions ARE affecting fitness, as extensively explaned by Price himself, selection WILL kick in. *Unless* we prevent natural selection to act by medical intervention. IF deteriration of the human genome happens it's most likely due to unabling natural selection by humans themselves.

t1_ffbcxuo,t3_eseb2k,"&gt; There is no evidence humans ever had tails. its all a error probility curves.

Of course there is no evidence for that because humans do not have tails. and it's not about error probability curves or whatever fancy words you invoke to look like savvy, it's just because humans do not have tails.

Also the great apes do not have tails. Losing the tail happened in the common ancestor of the hominids. And we do have evidence of that, in embryonic gestation and in our genes.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF). The embryonic tail is composed of several complex tissues besides the developing vertebrae, including a secondary neural tube (spinal cord), a notochord, mesenchyme, and tail gut. These anatomic feats are typical and defining of the vertebrate tail. By the eighth week of gestation, the sixth to twelfth vertebrae have disappeared via cell death, and the fifth and fourth tail vertebrae are still being reduced. Likewise, the associated tail tissues also undergo cell death and regress. The remnant of vertebrae that remain shrink and fuse and eventually form the coccyx.

Moreover, we still have all the tail genes also found in animals that still wag a tail. In fact, the genes that control the development of tails in mice and other vertebrates have been identified (the Wnt-3a and Cdx1 genes). These tail genes have also been found in the human genome. As discussed below in detail, the development of the normal human tail in the early embryo has been investigated extensively, and apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a significant role in removing the tail of a human embryo after it has formed. It is now known that down-regulation of the Wnt-3a gene induces apoptosis of tail cells during mouse development, and similar effects are observed in humans. Additionally, researchers have identified a mutant mouse that does not develop a tail, and this phenotype is due to a regulatory mutation that decreases the Wnt-3a gene dosage. 

We do not even need to know about the fossil evidence of the loss of the tail in hominid ancestors. The embryoonic and genetic evidence says it all.",1579912993
t3_eti3z7,t3_eti3z7,"What do you want to know/understand about it? Here's a breakdown of what they did, but it in no way supports GE, the extinction of H1N1, or that most mutations are bad.   


  

The authors took all available accession numbers \[numbers used to identify data in GeneBank\] for flu genomes from the Influenza Research Database(Zhang et al., 2017), Fluegenome.org (which looks is no longer available as of 1/24/2020)(Lu et al., 2007), and 2009-2010 H1N1 versions from a paper (Christman et al., 2011). They took the accession numbers and grabbed the genomic data from GenBank resulting in 3,755 human and 351 swine genomes. Then, they performed a multiple sequence alignment (which they said was quite easy because of how few indels there were #irony). Taking those alignments, they then compared the sequences to a reference H1N1 genome (which one they used isn’t clear in the methods, presumably it was California/04/2009 from the (Christman et al., 2011) study which they keep referencing by the second author, Kedwaii).   
 

From here, they present two lines of analysis: 1) they calculate mutation differences from this holotype genome through 2010 and 2) they calculate the mutations from H1N1 strains from 1918 to 2012 using a slightly modified A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 genome as the reference. 

The mutation differences are calculated as SNPs, indels, transitions, transversions, non-synonymous amino acid changes, dN/dS ratio (non-syn to synonymous changes), protein length, normalized codon scores (NSC), and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).

Figure 1 shows the mutations from the California/04/2009 up through the last H1N1 genome sequenced/collected in 2010. The last sequence has 80 mutations compared to the first sequence. They fit a regression line and found a slope of 41.959 although they report it as 42.1. This means, on average, we expect H1N1 virus to mutate 42 alleles per year (Carter and Sanford, 2012).   
 

Figure 2 is essentially the same analysis but begins with the amended A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 reference and catalogues mutations until 2012 using available sequences. The authors comment on a 1950’s extinction followed by a 1976 reintroduction of the virus. It’s unclear that these viruses are actually that well-related on the basis of this graph which seems to suggest distinct lineages merging around this time (notice the jump around 1980 from 1000 mutations to 1500 which linearly correlates with the 2009 outbreak strain). The authors do comment on the two distinct lineages of frozen versus non-frozen H1N1 strains i.e.—zoonosis causing antigenic shift. 

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing that there two distinct lineages of H1N1 being shown, they readjusted the timeframes and were able to re-calculate mutation rates per year which are shown in Figure 3. The top lines shows the corrected mutation rate of 14.4 per year and the bottom line shows the number of non-synonymous mutations per year (2.4). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the paper starts to break down:

Using these data, they estimate that the first arrival of H1N1 to be around 1893 and suggest that since it’s arrive until 1918, 325 new mutations were acquired (25 years x 15 mutations per year, even though the number is actually 14.4 according to their data). 

Now, the authors essentially assert and use language which insinuates “deleterious effects” from those mutations in the organism. For example, they say “nucleotide degeneracy” to mean “the nucleotide changed.” It doesn’t actually mean the mutation was bad. They also say, “further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non-adaptive.” That doesn’t mean deleterious, that literally means “the majority of mutations don’t increase fitness” i.e.—they can be deleterious *or neutral*.  

Figure 4 is the same analysis as before, but now shows the samples derived from porcine versus those derived from humans. Nothing terribly interesting here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The remaining figures graphically represent the type of mutation occurring between the lineages over time.   


Many of the conclusions they draw aren't supported by what they actually showed. For example, nothing in this paper evaluates fitness of the mutations they characterized.

t3_eseb2k,t3_eseb2k,"&gt; Humans had a tailbone right?

We still do have one, the coccyx.

Probably you meant ""humans once had tails"" but this is also wrong because not humans once had tails but one of their evolutionary ancestors. That would even be one of the ancestors of the Hominidae (=all great apes and humans and extinct species of hominids) because chimps, bonobos, gorillas and orang utans do not have tails either.

So you want to see fossils. Indeed we have many many fossils of hominids, more than 6000 altogether but all these are of hominids, not their common ancestor. That's mostly because that common ancestor was a forest dweller and tropical forests don't preserve fossils quite well, that's why we have rather abundant fossils of hominids in the human lineage because those left the forests and also why we don't have much fossils of chimpanzee evolution.

The hominid fossils indeed show a neat and chronological transition in traits from ape-like to human forms, like a gradual increase in skull volume, getting shorter arms but londer and stronger legs and gradual improvement in upright gait.

Now what about the tail. We have morphological and genetic evidence of tail vestiges.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF).

t1_fffz6je,t3_etc8gl,"Now that I’ve explained how evolution actually works a couple times and it was already explained how organisms diversify to exploit available niches following an extinction event could you please be a bit more clear about what you are talking about here?

So are you suggesting that cockroaches and stag beetles are practically the same thing? 

These are the types of differences we already see among beetles. They’re still beetles because they have to be. Their ancestors were beetles. The same species of beetle if you go back far enough but they’ve obviously each acquired traits that the other lacks even though all cockroaches look like cockroaches and all stag beetles look like stage beetles because of how heredity spreads genes about a breeding population but not with groups that they can no longer produce fertile offspring by trying to breed with. They may even be said to have profound differences. They didn’t occur all at once, but they did occur.

What about domesticated dogs? They’re not all just the same size and shape animal with a different color fur are they? Some have short noses, some have long ones. Some are long and slender, some are wide and stalky. These types of changes separate us from Homo neanderthalensis as both lineages likely diverged from something like Homo heidelbergensis. These are all humans but not all the same group you see all around you. Even more profound changes if you compare us to robust Paranthropus species or Chimpanzees but as these lineages diverged from our before all of us independently acquired our unique traits the ancestor of all of us may be something more like Graecopithecus or Sahelanthropus and not exactly like any of the resulting groups. This is hominini but you need to compare those animals, and not modern forms to the ancestor of gorillas and Nikalipithecus would be more like the common ancestor of humans and gorillas  which can be traced even further back to animals like Proconsul and Aegyptopithecus but always a minor change in each case and not like comparing us directly to living gibbons or colobus monkeys. We share a common ancestor with tarsiers before the emergence of monkeys with organisms like Eosimius and Darwinius  being close to the time of this split. Including more groups and the common ancestor of these already small primates is starting to look a lot more like the ancestor of tree shrews until we back far enough and the ancestor of both groups is the same animal with glires (rabbits and rodents) also starting out looking a bit like a shrew as well. This isn’t as hard to grasp when we consider that tree shrews, shrews, and elephant shrews are found within three of the four divergent groups of living placental mammals. Juramaia likely represents our split from the marsupials but it may have given birth to helpless young just like marsupials still do, just like monotremes do if it wasn’t for the eggs they lay immediately before their babies emerge out of them. If you keep going back, though, the fossil record has several gaps explained by genetics. It doesn’t mean that we don’t have fossils, but most of what we do have consists of teeth and bits of jaw once our direct ancestors became small, small enough to survive the event that killed the dinosaurs. They had already been growing small before that because they couldn’t compete with them. It was their small size that ultimately led to us but before dinosaurs were dominating our planet, it was our own lineage, the synapids that outcompeted the sauropsids (or everything more closely related to reptiles and birds than to mammals). Dimetrodon is one of such synapsids, even though it may not be directly ancestral. And what about the ancestor of something like that. They were much smaller and probably cold blooded like lizards and they looked a lot like lizards, at least superficially, which isn’t much of a jump when considering salamanders are a lot like amphibious lizards and the ancestor of reptiliamorphs was also amphibious like a salamander but it wasn’t a salamander or an amphibian. That’s where our lineage diverges from the lineage leading to amphibians and is approaching the move to land from a fish ancestor for which many examples exist - and a side branch, the lung fish, still lives to this day. If we were to keep going all the way back the earliest fish were more like swimming worms with several important changes between that and bony fish. 

So despite, nothing being all at once, or a leap from one fundamentally different kind of life to the next but successive tiers of superficial changes compiled upon fundamental similarities there’s nothing left to consider but how dog breeds and subspecies are a similar result from the same process but with humans being the selective pressure in one case and natural selection in the other we still have genetic drift, heredity, genetic isolation, and so on but all you need to add is time. The time necessary to lead to a greater amount of divergence so that isolated groups can no longer produce fertile offspring but instead infertile hybrids like the result of breeding a horse and donkey being a mule that itself is sterile. This is about the point where these isolated groups start to compile on the successive changes that don’t cross over into the other group and that’s when the profound differences between the groups become apparent. It isn’t between parents and children but between distant cousins that we find dramatic differences or if we happen to skip over several hundreds or thousands of generations like in the case of the the human-chimp common ancestor and how chimpanzees and humans both eventually wound up strikingly different from how they started and each other despite the persistent similarities (including having the same broken genes and retroviruses) that we use to help us work out how everything is related.",1579912530
t1_fffs9ld,t3_esbgc1,"&gt;But viruses are nothing more than replication machines

Paul, if you like things that are 'nothing more than replication machines', the rest of the biosphere is going to *blow your mind*. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They just replicate. That is their only function, and the faster they replicate the more efficiently that replication machinery is working. 

For someone claiming *I* have it backwards, this is all kinds of wrong. First, you're deciding that replication is their only function, which implies, given your position regarding creation, that your specific god CREATES DEADLY REPLICATION ENGINES DELIBERATELY. And since you seem to be convinced that said deadly replication engines subsequently die out due to 'genetic entropy', this also directly suggests you think your specific god does this repeatedly, in real time, even today. Because...the lulz?

Secondly, you can't even get your efficiencies right. Faster != more efficient, especially since your entire argument *relies on the fact that viral replication is error prone*. Fast replication is sloppy replication, and fast replication that also kills the host is sloppy *and* counterproductive. Biology doesn't select for speed unless speed is useful, and here it is not. The 'wrench' as you describe it is absolutely beneficial (if it wasn't, it would be lost quickly), and yet you are STILL trying to argue that this is somehow detrimental, just so you can cleave to this clearly incorrect notion that viral mortality equates to viral fitness.",1579912091
t1_ffg813q,t3_etc8gl,"Well there were extinctions that occurred before the Cambrian period ever started but otherwise that’s basically it. Whatever organisms exist in any given environment will exploit any available niche until some are better at it than others and that’s where natural selection plays a vital role. Then when most of them do eventually die off, whatever is left exploits those available niches that arise. One main reason for having more fossils starting around the Cambrian period is probably likely due to several extinctions as there was an evolutionary arms race geared towards survival. There may have been organisms filling similar niches before that but we just can’t find all of them because they aren’t well preserved. It may have even been a mass extinction event that we can’t find any fossil evidence for, but nothing like the great dying or the KT extinction events that are better known for such events.",1579908999
t1_fffsson,t3_etc8gl,"I think I explained this a bit in my main response to the original post but now that I know what you’re actually talking about perhaps I can add a bit more. 

Consider the types of variation that don’t get acted on by natural selection but disperse throughout a population anyway like eye color. Consider those that are detrimental but get passed on anyway like diabetes. Alongside beneficial mutations others spread and it isn’t only natural selection that controls the variety of traits that eventually spread throughout a population. There is genetic isolation such that some trait in one isolated population doesn’t spread to the main population. This is how we tell sister groups apart like the various dog breeds. They exist simultaneously in the same environment for what natural selection would produce in different environments or among populations filling a different role within the environment. There’s heredity, which unlike genetic isolation, spreads these traits (good, bad, or otherwise) throughout the breeding population such that once enough time passes there will be a spreading about of traits that aren’t lethal or reproduction inhibitors. That’s how multiple people have green eyes and how others have blue or brown. They didn’t emerge from a six eyed predecessor but from a brown eyed ancestor and the descendants acquired mutations that provide the phenotypical trait of having a different colored eye. There’s more variation with eyes than just this, but this is a good example for this example. 

Genetic drift is when a specific gene type (allele) is eventually weeded our of the population. For whatever reason, call it chance, one trait becomes common down the road that doesn’t provide any known beneficial or detrimental side effects. And then on whatever is left after all of this is accounted for and as multiple mutations pile on top of those that don’t provide any known benefit or detrimental effect such that already common traits acquire the mutations that steer the development of the population through natural selection. Light skin in one area more often than another because it provides a benefit in terms of vitamin D production but dark skin in others because it provides better protection against the damaging radiation from the sun or the acquisition of a trait that allows humans to survive on less oxygen but isn’t necessary in another environment will be more common in areas with less oxygen like at the top of mountains. The single mutations on the way to producing these traits usually don’t get noticed but they spread throughout the population because of heredity and genetic drift. As the accumulating changes do provide a survival benefit or take one away they’ll gradually spread throughout the population accordingly except in cases where detrimental mutation results in death or infertility and then they don’t get passed on at all. 

Why organs in a different location or a different sized brain when the less significant mutations don’t get noticed on their own? Because without having much effect on survival and reproduction, the other traits are selected for instead as whatever is left surviving spreads their genes throughout a population - about 50% from each parent. Never the exact same ones being passed on unless considering identical twins. Whatever does get passed on from an essentially 50% combines with the 50% from the other parent and the phenotype is a consequence of the mix of genes. A recessive gene mutation may not get noticed at all until enough time has passed for a descendant to acquire two copies of the same gene and other traits may change almost right away. By the time these genes have spread throughout the population so that recessive traits start appearing or as more mutations pile upon what is already there as they too spread around the population is driven in a certain direction with some variation at the individual level but a more consistent trend across the population. Generally, because of population mechanics, the unique variations go unnoticed until they become common. By this time, further mutation can only build upon what is already present. 

There doesn’t need to be natural selection at every step of the way favoring one set and killing off the rest. It usually doesn’t kill everything all at once anyway allowing some of the persistent detrimental genes to acquire more mutations to turn them into beneficial ones as well. Why are groups so similar? Because of how evolution works. It doesn’t allow dramatic phenotypical change across a single generation such that a survivor of such a dramatic change is still able to breed and produce viable offspring with members of its own species that lack such a dramatic change. In some cases, such a dramatic change kills the embryo can even develop. 

Split the population up into smaller groups and they diverge both genetically and morphologically such that some mutations only occur in one group, or if they exist in the entire group, are quite rare in some and common in others - genetic drift and heredity. If in both cases survival and reproduction is still possible two or more related groups continue to drift apart so that their ability to interbreed correlated with the time they’ve been genetically isolated and once they can no longer inter-breed at all they may adapt to the same environment but in a different way as the genes from one group can no longer flow into the other. This is where more distantly related groups look and act more differently than the closely related groups and this is where homology plays a role as evidence of the time since divergence as well as the shared ancestry the groups all share. 

Now, with evolution explained, you should have at least a basic grasp on what you’re arguing against. A bit more understanding on why separate ancestry doesn’t withstand scrutiny. And perhaps even enough understanding to know that this entire process isn’t driven towards a teleological goal. The whole time superficial changes accumulate on top of fundamental similarities (with a bit of an explanation for how this happens) and why despite it not being particularly beneficial to have some specific organization in their body plans why different body plans arise and why this is sufficient evidence of common ancestry (though other excuses could be made for this with less support) 

This is why it isn’t just one piece of the puzzle or just one piece of evidence but an overwhelming preponderance of it that establishes evolutionary an inescapable fact of population genetics, despite some saying it is simple the best explanation we have. Life undergoes change and when looking at the facts such as the fundamental similarities, the mechanisms by which mutation, heredity, genetic drift, natural selection, sexual selection, and artificial selection act upon populations and the law of monophyly which states that all populations are a subset of their parent populations and can never transform into something completely new (because of how evolution works) and the law of biodiversity (these processes add both the variety within a population and are the mechanisms by which speciation occurs), there is no other way to explain the biodiversity we find on our planet but through evolution. 

Now, with that established we have also looked into the evolution for common ancestry and even several overlapping hypotheses for how it all originated in the first place, that creationism doesn’t stand up as an alternative explanation. It doesn’t provide anything accurate that can’t already be explained by the theory of evolution or by our findings in studying the processes by which simple chemistry *can* lead to life without supernatural intervention. And that’s where we turn to all of the evidence for the age of our planet and the surrounding solar system or for there never being a global flood and how the Bible is wrong in almost every way in these regards just like there is no firmament. It doesn’t exist. It wasn’t created on day two of creation week by an incantation spell. Of course, there are plenty of Christians okay with this. Fallible humans made stuff up and what they wrote isn’t meant to be taken literally or interpreted as actual history. And for that, I’d suggest BioLogos, unless you want to debate against my atheism in the proper forum.",1579908630
t1_ffdmz7c,t3_esr9ns,"That does clear things up, thanks.  One tidbit for clarification from my end:

&gt;My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication.

This gets a ""sorta""; it's not a distinction I'd generally draw.  In a general sense, a mutation is an inherited difference in the sequence of the genome.  This is generally either a result of the replication machinery making a mistake (inserting the wrong base, jumping strands, etc.), by damage which causes such a mistake (example: UV light causes [pyrimidine dimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer) that cause the replication machinery to copy ""CT"" as ""TT""), or by inaccurate repair such as after a double-strand break.

For most of these things, there are ways they can be caught and repaired; slower-reproducing organisms often have system dedicated to specifically repairing more common mutations, or ""proof-reading"" capacity in their replication machinery.  This means that it's always going to be a race against time in a replicating cell; if they're not caught before the cells divide (again, in the case of mistakes during replication itself) then it's a mutation that will be carried by the daughter cell that gets the different copy.

Basically, you're right to say that changes can occur during or prior to replication, though changes prior often don't ""stick"" or necessarily even amount to a mutation until they cause a mistake during replication (or are repaired inaccurately).

And yes, given that our OP appears to think that enzymes with novel traits arising doesn't count as mutation, somehow, there's still something seriously amiss there.",1579907944
t3_eti3z7,t3_eti3z7,"It seems pretty straightforward to me: They tried to say that H1N1 demonstrates genetic entropy by claiming it is 'less fit' now than it used to be, and used mortality data to argue that point. 

This both ignores that the environment changed (There was significant government action to curb H1N1), but also falsely equivocates 'fitness' with 'mortality', as if killing one's host is the goal of a parasitic virus.

The refusal to accept that the only viable measure of 'fitness' is 'ability to survive and produce the next generation and ensure the next generation survives' is a core point of creationist denialism.",1579907627
t3_etc8gl,t3_etc8gl,"We are talking about gradual change to the genetics such that one individual acquires the mutation before it spreads via population genetics. Most often these changes are minor or at least neither beneficial or detrimental for survival and reproduction though sometimes there are quite drastic changes because of some minor gene variation or the merging of chromosomes that limit the ability to produce viable offspring but doesn’t quite eliminate that possibility. 

So we have both minor changes and drastic ones but usually the drastic eventual changes don’t happen all at once. A few examples have probably been provided over at r/evolution but for our purposes consider wing development, eye development, brain enlargement and several traits like these that set different organisms apart. 

For wings, it depends on which group we are talking about as most often in tetrapod lineages this is the result of webbing or flaps of skin between the digits of the fingers or along the side of the body such as in colugos and other gliding animals. At first webbed fingers may not be much use for animals that don’t return to the water but if they live up in a tree like the ancestors of pterosaurs and bats or several of these other examples, those that acquired successive variation on top of small less useful membranes of skin could use this adaptation to survive a fall or to assist in jumping from tree to tree until they got better at gliding and slowly accumulating more mutations so that they could turn falling in style into actual flight. For the other tetrapods, the birds, these wings are more like lightweight arms covered in feathers. The lightweight bones come with being non-aquatic archosaurs. The feathers come with being dinosaurs. And tracing their lineage as best as we can, some of the more famous examples of what would actually be cousins and not direct ancestors would be Tyrannosaurus, Oviraptor, and several other fully feathered theropods but manirapors and velociraptors were even more like birds and even starting to get small enough to get more of a benefit from their wings than simply staying warm or incubating a clutch of eggs. Some of them could run up steep inclines and maybe even glide before more adaptions like the loss of a long reptilian tail, the fusing of their fingers, and losing the ability to lay multiple eggs at the same time continued to make them lighter as they also acquired further adaptions to their wings and powerful chest muscles (in neognathes) allowing them to fly for longer distances as other adaptions to their brains allowed them to navigate these long distances. The other modern branch of birds either couldn’t fly or wasn’t nearly as good at it so they mostly stuck to the ground growing larger in some cases, losing their wings, or both. 

For the eye, we have living examples of what would be intermediate forms as well as the more complex different varieties. Cephalopods and vertebrates both developed camera eyes but vertebrate eyes are wired backward as to create a blind spot that the brain has to accommodate for, quite well, without us knowing. Further adaptions may be the post orbital bar that became fused to the brain case, the cartilage creating the basis of an eye socket and three eyelids (the third one is just a vestige in humans but the enclosed eye socket sets us apart from several other animals like most carnivores). Before the camera eye, a more ancestral trait would be lacking the lens used for better focus or the lack of color sensitivity so that everything is black and white or shades of gray. The nautilus has eyes like this. They are round like ours but lack the lens covering them. This is still a benefit over having less focus where insects went a different way having several compound eyes instead. All of this likely started out with light sensitive proteins like in the eyespots of several single celled organisms before one of those intermediates from being just light sensitive cells is found in flat worms that have them set inside the equivalent of a funnel. Simple light sensitive proteins at first may not tell the organisms much more than what several plants use to grow towards suns light away from the shade or provide a signal for several protists to escape the light where they might get detected but subsequent adaptions provide these animals that have them the ability to see what they’re looking at. Related is how the line leading to mammals lost the pineal eye than lizards still have when they became warm blooded. Such an eye doesn’t help much in terms of vision and when you don’t need it for detecting certain warm wavelengths of light it can just go away. 

And for brain development there is a whole lot that can be said about it, but without getting into too many specifics it starts out as nothing more than a clustering of neurons before some of them like in worms start to provide some of the regulatory and sensory functions that come with more developed brains. Larger, more developed brains don’t just suddenly appear all at once but build upon this template adding whole new features or enlarging existing ones over time. Even a small increase provides a benefit until it starts to interfere with flight or survivability at child birth. It also generally grows larger in social groups and even larger in those who are already intelligent for problem solving and the calorie intake that comes with processing meat. However, in our case, there are also several genes that were “damaged” along the way that play a role. We lack the musculature of most non-human apes unless because of damaged genes and the emergence of regulatory genes that have duplicated at some time in the past. Part of this is responsible for our weak bite in comparison as well as our jaw muscles not being connected to a crest above our skulls that we no longer have or need. This allows our skulls to grow larger as a tumor suppressor gene being damaged not only makes us more susceptible to brain cancer but provides us with the 10% increase that sets us apart from the other apes that we use for higher order thinking skills which leads to technology when we also have dexterous hands no longer as strong as they are in other apes giving us fine motor skills. These two things working in tandem lead to increased brain mass over the other apes, especially once our ancestors started cooking food making it possible to absorb more calories with less effort. Why don’t the other animals have nearly as complex brains or display the same capacity for technology and abstract concepts? A lot of superficial changes and some rather noticeable ones occurred in our lineage that wasn’t found in theirs and each of these provided a survival benefit on their own (expect maybe the one that now results in more brain cancer) so that they would be selected for. We’re not as fast or as strong as other animals are but we can run for longer without getting tired, we don’t overheat as fast, and we have the dexterity necessary to develop intricate technologies. And because we are a social species the increased intelligence and comprehension and other things that come with having a larger brain allow us to develop larger social networks again creating another benefit for survival. Walking bipedally also helps with our ability to possess a large brain to body mass compared to those that walk on all fours because this method of walking, especially as it is in us, burns fewer calories and provides less neck strain than holding our necks out in front of us with a huge weight bearing down on our necks as we walk. 

Of course, there are also several problems that come with having each of these traits in the wrong environment or when it comes to survival just being born so that fish that live in the dark lost their eyes, birds that don’t fly have reduced wings or lack them entirely (or have a useless appendage in their place that takes less resources to make). And our brains cause a higher infant mortality rate even when they continue developing into adulthood or when the bones of our skulls remain detached until shortly birth so that social groups and technology plays a more vital role in our survival than is necessary for animals that only meet up to have sex.",1579903088

t3_etc8gl,t3_etc8gl,"&gt; I'm talking about variation in individual animals within a single new generation.

No, radical changes are usually detrimental, so they tend to be selected against. 

&gt; I'm trying to understand, from a genuine evolutionary perspective, how the simple, minute tweaks associated with new structures would accumulate. It seems like they're not going to contribute to selection at all because all of the overwhelming force of the immediate utility associated with factors like size, sexual attractiveness, intelligence, etc.

Minor changes can either be neutral or benefit, and they will still get passed on. A trait that is neutral today may not be neutral in the future, so it is a misunderstanding to think that a change must have an immediate effect. 

&gt; it seems quite striking that we're not all beautiful, intelligent, smart, etc. Why? Well, those are the factors we have been selecting for in each other for a very very very long time.

While it is true that beautiful and intelligent people tend to reproduce *easier*, they don't necessarily reproduce *more*. The reality is that almost anyone who wants to reproduce has historically been able to reproduce.  A trait will only be weeded out of the gene pool if there is such a strong selective force that it seriously hurts the ability to reproduce, and neither unattractiveness or lack of intelligence seriously hinder a person's ability to attract a mate. If anything, it causes unattractive and dumb people to mate with each other which will make the traits even more likely to be passed on. And-- particularly in the modern era-- these people tend to have larger families.

&gt; The second objection that shift in environmental conditions will change the nature of the ""ideal specimen"" such that meaningful transformations in the ""practical invariants"" of a species (which you can relatively define as those things which remain almost identical from parent to child) will be selected for over and against immediate factors, that just seems non-empirical because things like speed, strength, intelligence, general symmetry, are meta-adaptations.

This paragraph isn't entirely clear, but again, you seem to be hung up on the idea of ""immediate factors."" Other than in genes that are so detrimental that you die or are physically unable to reproduce, ""immediate"" just isn't a thing in evolution. Any trait that is not so detrimental that it prevents you from reproducing has a decent likelihood of being passed on.",1579899755

At the end of the day, evolution is not abiogenesis irrespective of how you want to interpret a book title.   


&gt; Do you see it as a fact, that humans are more morally significant than animals?

Absolutely. It's part of my moral worldview which I don't extend to most animals, except my dog. Elevating humankind's morality and welling above that of other animals is in no way dishonest or has anything to do with evolution since evolution is not a moral claim.

&gt; because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people.    
  
&gt;  
&gt; I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes. 

That's actually not how it works. Blood perfusion to the brain is tightly controlled by barometric sensors in your carotid arteries and downstream affectors. Blood is never diverted from the brain to other organ systems as it  has the absolute highest priority for perfusion in the body. The brain will literally shunt blood away from your other organs and cause them to die before it disrupts its own blood supply. Vasoconstriction in the brain is met with hemodynamic  autoregulation responses which preserve perfusion over small ranges as the brain is extremely sensitive to changes in glucose/oxygen.   


Anyways, during sympathetic nervous system activation acetylcholine gets released at various innervated locations. Acetylcholine causes the adrenal medullas to release catecholamines. The catecholamines cause vasoconstriction at various unneeded anatomical sites like the GI tract, kidneys, and skin. That blood is then shunted to skeletal muscles, heart, and lungs.

Maybe, but that's kind of the whole point of the SNS--get out/away/fight. It's not meant to be used to sit down and write math proofs. It causes hyperfocus on the task at hand, moving that attention to other non-imminent tasks isn't a priority. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat.  

SNS response is not a binary dichotonomy. It exists along a spectrum, is modulated by parasympathetic activity, and interacts with numerous endocrine axes to produce several degrees of response. SNS activation of ""I have a test in 3 weeks"" compared to ""I need to fight or die"" is different.

It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we? 

Anti-scientific doctrines are inherently dangerous and cause harm to humankind. Interacting in the world under a false-understanding of reality demonstrably confers harm to others. If you don't believe that is a worthy cause of trying to combat, perhaps your moral system is lacking. However, it is a free country (presumably you live in a relatively free country) and you are allowed to prioritize and harbor values as you see fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Do you feel like humans are generally bad and stupid, and like maybe the majority of humans require smarter people to force them to make good choices, sort of as their overlords or something?  

Not at all. There are very few people who are ""bad."" The problem is that good people are animated by bad ideas--which religion seems to have a near infinite supply of. All ideas should be met with skepticism and many ideas are privy to scientific inquiry. Science is a reliable way to determine truth. If someone wants to play scientist, they shouldn't expect anything less than a scientific treatment of their idea.

IF it were part of the model, it would be part of the DFE chart. It's not. And even today, beneficial mutations and ""adaptive evolution"" lie OUTSIDE the model(s).

Mutation is the mechanism that creates diversity. No matter what kind of mutation. No matter if the result is conceptually good, bad, or neutral. We have examples of all three and I’ve even provided plenty of evidence for this myself. You’ve provided some yourself for this when discussing the mtDNA MRCA for specific clades you wanted to discuss as if they were completely isolated groups. A poodle and bulldog are quite different from each other because they possess different alleles of the same genes - mutation creates the diversity. Artificial selection, a process by which humans create breed, is a purification process selecting out which mutant varieties we want over which ones we don’t. By selecting specific traits we remove the other traits from the isolated gene pools we create in this fashion so that within these populations the diversity is less than if we consider the entire group like all domesticated gods, which are obviously all the same “kind” of animal. 

It is the patterns of mutation and selection found in genetics and in fossils that provide us with a clear evolutionary progression where we don’t have to watch every birth take place or produce every single mother of a mother to get a clear understanding that breeds of dogs originated from a few wolves. They’re still wolves, but now they are also domesticated dogs too. 

The higher levels of classification are created by the same process but the descendants living today have grown further apart with time. We can still trace this back anyway with a couple stumbling blocks in certain cases - not because no link exists, but because a few different intermediate forms could all fit as the actual intermediate and they all are living at the same time as cousins to each other.

1. Several people, in previous threads, have referenced this as evidence of common ancestry. It was the reason i posted the review.  This study was referenced in the immediately previous thread on natural selection, and was why i quoted my review in this thread.
2. Other subsequent studies have overtly made a claim of 'speciation!', which Lenski himself disputed.  This is also quoted in my review:

""The claim of 'new speciation!', is only an arbitrary definition, not anything compelled by any changes in the morphology or genetic structure of the organism. To claim this is 'real evolution!' is absurd. It is obviously just adaptation, &amp; only demonstrates the viability &amp; adaptability of this particular organism. Some organisms do NOT have this capability, but die under unfriendly conditions. So this phenomenon does not apply universally, as would be expected if this were a mechanism for macro evolution, but is unique to e.coli. 

*Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit+ as a ""speciation event"" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said ""that becoming Cit+ was only a first step on the road to possible speciation"", and thus did not propose that the Cit+ mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution*

So the claim of 'new speciation!' is not even claimed by Lenski, the one doing the study, even though hordes of eager Believers cling to it as 'scientific proof!' of common descent.""

3. If 'nobody claims that!' was true, why would Lenski rebut that claim?  Obviously, some do.  My statement stands and is accurate.

Where'd you get that from? You asked what reads to me like a didn't-read-or-mentally-process-anything-I-said counter-question. Rather than simply ignoring it (arguably the better option) I gave you what seemed like an equally meaningful and useful answer. No need to overthink it.

If you *do* want to think more about something, how about the previous post I made:

Do you see it as a fact, that humans are more morally significant than animals?

It's okay to say yes there.

I guess if you must to be honest, ""no"" is also acceptable, but that would be a problematic response, because it would cause cognitive dissonance in your own mind, not to mention provide fodder for the key complaint of the Wedge Document authors.

There's plenty--so much--to disagree with in the position of their document, but it strikes me that, if you could agree that human life is valuable in a significant way, and could explain that persuasively by appealing to scientific naturalism and not religious dogma, that would take a lot of wind out of the sails of people writing and pushing that view. 

Also interested in your thoughtful consideration of the other idea -- that whether it's a secret ""Christian Taliban"" conspiracy to Literally Overthrow Science and usher in Theocratic Hegemony or not, doesn't mean that it's not best responded to with a fully-engaged mind.

Insults and ego-trips come from a place of insecurity, and they interfere with clear thought, because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people. I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes.

Most of the literature I've read along those lines has more to do with managing knowledge workers, but the data is intuitive, and appears to be robustly supported by research, not only for knowledge workers but also even for people in literal physical combat: Fear and stress make you stupid and reduce your capacity for clear, effective rational thought.

Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat. But it seems irrational to be so certain about your position but at the same time to be terrified or stressed by someone who wants to use academic research and argumentation to change peoples' minds about it. It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we?

Oh, or maybe that goes back to the ""human life"" thing.

https://creation.com/human-tails - this link is intentionally misleading. Nobody said that all human tail atavisms are “fully functional.” Why would they be? Genes turned back on so that the coccyx doesn’t remain short and fused just makes it so that the tails we still have look like tails are still atavisms or evidence of a time when our ancestors still had relatively useless tails. It would take even more mutations to acquire the even older trait of the tail being useful. This is like how dolphins born with their anal fins counts as an atavism of a time when their ancestors still had them, but we don’t except nor do we find dolphins with four fully functional legs complete with feet for walking. 

An atavism is evidence that the genes exist to produce lost ancestral traits that shouldn’t exist at all if there was no evolutionary relationship. It is just one small piece of the puzzle in the big picture.",1579858958

I guess it depends on how you define ""create"" and ""new"". 

My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication. The OP's example ignored the second category altogether. His analogy ""This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'"" is clearly referring to mutations that occur within an existing gene. It would be fair to say it results in a ""new gene sequence"" but is the gene itself new? 

Really, whether it is ""new"" or not is a semantic distinction. I can see the point you are making, and I wouldn't say you are wrong, but you aren't really saying the same thing the OP is.

&gt;Unsubstantiated accusation. I have quoted excerpts from the study, and made arguments based on observations. Dismissal is not a reasoned rebuttal. If i have misrepresented anything, bear witness to that misrepresentation. Merely accusing is a fallacy.

You're half-right.  It would be a fallacy if I claimed you were doing such things and then refused to back it up, and I can't really blame you for being on the defensive about such.  But what I actually did was predict what points others would raise against you.  And indeed, we can see replies to that effect; /u/Sweary_Biochemist and /u/OddJackdaw have pointed out that no one is holding up Prof. Lenski's work as proving common descent, both of them and /u/ThurneysenHavets and /u/TheBlackCat13 pointed out flaws in your understanding of mutation (as have I and folks responding here, but we'll get to that), and at the same time at least two of them pointed out that we know that new genes forming is a thing - which is, as it so happens, what my post above was also on about using a particular example.

But that's really an aside.  To the meat of it:

&gt;The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.

And the _inability_ of any bacteria to digest nylon byproducts, including the bacteria that evolved under laboratory conditions to do so, is quite well-documented.

&gt;It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions. There is no structural changes to the genome.

How does a bacterium produce new enzymes without changes to its genome?

&gt;It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

To the contrary; these enzymes are proteins translated from RNA transcribed from the DNA of the bacterial genome.  The fact that the parental bacteria didn't have enzymes for this and their dependents do is a change in the genome.  Such a change in the genome between generations is practically the definition of a mutation.

&gt; But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria. Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.

__How?__  I want you to be explicit here; if you are _only_ going to answer one part of my post, if you do not have the time or patience, please, _please_ address this section: ___How_, outside of mutation, do you propose bacteria with enzymes that digest nylon got them if not by mutation?  What is the ""more credible explanation"" you refer to?__

&gt; It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

Speciation in bacteria is something of a toss-up.  

I would agree entirely that it's a stretch to say such things show common ancestry - which is why no one's making that claim, and I'd prefer it if you did not bear false witness about us in that manner, if you please.

As to gene creation, it is not merely that they secrete the enzymes.  Those enzymes themselves are not present in their relatives; the genes those enzymes are produced from are simply not present.  Again, in the case of the strain evolved in the lab, we can say with certainty that their ancestor did not posses it because _we still have their frozen ancestors from the start of the experiment_.  

---

&gt;It is not a mechanism for common ancestry.

It is one of several that play a part, actually.

&gt; Mutation is an entropic process, that degrades an organism.

No, that is not demonstrated and in fact we have numerous examples of beneficial mutations - including the aforementioned genes that allow for digesting nylon byproducts.

&gt; It does not increase complexity, ...

Mutations include gene duplications, which can and does result in there being multiple copies of a gene that then can mutate independently to give rise to two different genes in the same gene family where once was one.  Having two related genes rather than one gene is, by any definition, more complex.

&gt; ... or create new genes, ...

The just-mentioned process above, among others, can and does observably give rise to novel genes that were not possessed by an organism's ancestors.

This is more egregious projection than Devin Nunes. My position remains the same, but I have been addressing the various and variable flimsy counter arguments you've been clumsily attempting to hurl at me. It seemed the polite thing to do. 

If I take the time to explain Kimura's model to you (and it is tragic that this is necessary), that does not mean I endorse it. Meanwhile you apparently *do*, yet don't actually even understand it. It was published in 1979, Paul: you've had long enough.

In contrast, no evidence for genetic entropy has ever been presented. Your ""much"" evidence is...lacking, while your excuses as to why ""populations that absolutely SHOULD exhibit genetic entropy mysteriously but reliably fail to do so"" continue to grow in self-contradictory spirals. Mice, even laboratory mice kept in optimal conditions and fed ad lib, where selective pressure is basically zero (a great analogy for humans) fail to show any sign of any 'entropic mutational accumulation'. They *drift*, sure, but they absolutely thrive as they do so. They have about half the mutations per generation we do, but can have five generations a year (and in the lab, they do). If GE actually existed, we'd see it pretty fast. The fact we don't suggests it's either so slow that actual speciation will render it irrelevant, or it isn't actually a thing. Either outcome invalidates a young, created human species (along with literally all the other evidence that clearly invalidates a young, created human species).

It's also misleading to say that mortality rates dropped in a smooth and gradual manner.

While the obvious truth is that the reason we don't see said drop that corresponds to better medical tech is because there wasn't a H1N1 outbreak until 1957.

It is also worth noting that Paul's continued assertion the H1N1 is extinct is really undercut by its continued existence. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/burden-of-h1n1.html why he persists in saying that is bewildering.

If we keep going back, proconsul is likely the ancestor of all apes but before this we have Aegyptopithecus and Victoriapithecus and maybe even Eosimius taking us all the way back to the origin of monkeys or the divergence between the lines leading to monkeys and tarsiers. The next step back includes all primates with a common ancestor more like pergatorius. 

I wish you’d present scientific sources because creation.com, Answers In Genesis and the Ark Park are creationist religious organizations which state quite obviously that they hold scripture as truth no matter how many times it is proven wrong. Facts that prove them wrong are dismissed and they say so right on each of these web sites. Actual science doesn’t start with the conclusion before the evidence indicates one. Try actual science if you’re going to provide a source to back up your claims. If you must continue with Christian organizations I’d take a peek at BioLogos.

I missed this: “a fool says in his heart their is no god” 

I thought this was funny for two reasons - first of all, and most importantly, evolution doesn’t stop being a fact because a god exists. It isn’t an atheistic theory. Secondly, I’m an atheist (a gnostic one) and while the Bible does say that, the Bible is just as wrong about that as it is about everything else it says. Keep bringing the jokes if you wish, but if we could stay in topic that would help you. Atheism, like theism, isn’t a religion but in both cases individuals may hold religious beliefs like Buddhism, Christianity, Jainism, or Hindu. I don’t hold a religion or believe in magic.

I'm sure that the flu would not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be, had WWI not taken place. Surely there's little doubt that it did exacerbate things.

t1_ffb9m97,t3_eseb2k,"You see, what your problem is, is that you think a ""species"" is this strictly defined thing with hard edges. It's not. A species is an abstraction that humans came up with to classify things. Granted that it's less of an abstraction than other taxonomic classifications in that it actually has something in biology that you can observe to define it. If two organisms are capable of producing an offspring which is, itself, capable of breeding, then they're the same species. When we see something that we can call a species, we give it a name.

The simple fact is that nature, especially biology, is too messy to perfectly fit into our neat little human-made categories. Read up on ""[ring species](https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Ring_species.asp)"" to see what I'm talking about.

Another thing that you don't seem to understand is that the idea of separate and distinct species means nothing when you're talking about a line of ancestry, since a genotype is constantly changing through the generations.

Then there's the issue of H1N1 being a zootonic(?) virus (I may have butchered the word), which behave differently in us than their usual hosts. Things like colds seem to do so well because they're both tuned for humans, and also don't do much to impair their host.

A gain of a trait or a loss of an ancestral one happens often enough to develop an evolutionary family tree. It is like those nested dolls where the most distant ancestral clades contain each of the next most recent clades that contain the next most recent clades. Humans still have the majority of these defining characteristics of each of their clades but some traits along the way were lost. Sometimes we even find transitions for some of the steps along the way. Sometimes the in between forms don’t fossilize but we can still compare genetic similarities since we also know how mutations raise biodiversity that can be selected for in sub populations differently when they occupy different niches or when the mutation appears after the split from the other members of any particular clade. 

We are eukaryotes, scotokaryotes, neokaryotes because of how our cells are arranged and the organelles contained not found in other groups. Our lack of chloroplasts is another trait that separates us from what would become plants but our similarities with plants shows that the common ancestor of both also lacked the chloroplasts that are a defining characteristic of the divergent lineage. 

Each descendant clade that follows provides us a basic overview of how the earliest cells gave rise to humans and the sister clades in each case help to explain the biodiversity that arose via this process. We are monkeys (simians) but often times people won’t admit this when they only consider a couple living types of Old World monkeys as monkeys along with all the New World Monkeys. Apes are a sister clade to what everyone will accept as Old World Monkeys (Cercopithecidae and colobus monkeys). Within this group we have great apes and lesser apes to distinguish between the subset of apes that diverged to give rise to gibbons and siamangs as our lineage continued down the path of Oranguntans, Gorillas, Chimpanzees and Humans. We are still great apes. Homininae contains all of these except Orangutans among what is still alive. Hominini contains chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans as well as several extinct forms and we’re all more than 98% similar genetically when considering our coding genes and around 96% identical when comparing the entire genome which only makes sense because we are all the same type of animal. The next more recent clade excludes chimpanzees and bonobos, but himinina includes Graecopithecus, Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and Homo. This is also probably the order that these take us from the human-chimp common ancestor to our genus. The next step is our species but technically we’d still be a population Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo rhodesiensis as well, despite the “you can’t outgrow your ancestry” usually applying to the higher clades more specifically. 

The entire time, a sub population the origin of each clade splits off from the original group. This tends to start out more along the lines of ethnic group, leading to a breed, to a subspecies, and so forth before the isolated group is no longer inter-fertile or able to inter-breed at all and then the clades get more defined as they drift apart genetically when they can no longer mix back together. This is why you can’t outgrow your ancestry. You are a descendant of the original population of every ancestral clade and you’ll continue to be a descendant no matter how different you have become or how ever many descendant populations arise from the current one many years into the future.

&gt;And if you don't think 2009 was Spanish flu explain why Sanford felt they were similar enough to compare, but the virus that existed afterwards wasn't.

Again, if you read their paper you'd know. The Swine Flu was a variant that was originally related to the 1917 Spanish flu lineage that went extinct (in humans) in the 1950s, but apparently jumped to swine and then back to humans again in 2009. The fact that it was associated with relatively low mortality in 2009 is explained by the high mutational load:

&gt;Nearest neighbor calculations (data not shown) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage. They cluster tightly with the 2009–2010 outbreak porcine viruses, all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses. Thus, we included the 2009–2010 viruses and the nine isolated, non-outbreak viruses in the “porcine” category. In this same figure, we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after (Figure ​(Figure2,2, circle) fall directly on the trajectory of the non-frozen lineage. This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re-introduction virus. Kedwaii, et al.[8] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses, an H1N2 and an H1N1, from different continents, but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve. Regardless, general attenuation due to genome-wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [54-56] associated with the 2009 pandemic. The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1,889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain.",1579809738

&gt;Feathered dinosaur ancestors” Sinosauropteryx and Caudipteryx are “dated” at 125 Ma (million years old) While confuciusornis was dated 127 Ma.

[While Sinosauropteryx had feather-like structures, it was not very closely related to the previous ""first bird"" Archaeopteryx.[1] There are many dinosaur clades that were more closely related to Archaeopteryx than Sinosauropteryx was, including the deinonychosaurians, the oviraptorosaurians, and the therizinosauroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx#Feathers). This is entirely consistent with the theory that modern birds are descended from the same lineage that gave us Velociraptor. 

Caudipteryx' classification is controversial to the point it's a fool's errand to use it as evidence for or against dino-bird evolution. 

Confuciusornis is many things, but it's decidedly not a modern bird given that Hesperornis and Ichthyornis are more closely related to those than Confuciusornis is.

Why go back to rage-debate when dealing with something so important if we don't have some part of us that feels it is genuinely at risk?

&gt;point of the ID movement is to replace scientific materialism, root and branch, with ""theistic understanding""s.

I'm reading that doc rather differently. To me, it looks like the goal is not to replace science with theology, but to stake out a way for science and scienctific progress to be compatible with the idea that it is a fact that humans are more morally significant than mere animals.

Do you see it as a fact that humans are more morally significant than animals? Have you recognized the harms done against society by people who disregarded that fact? If so, you share a common goal with these wedge document creators, even if you disagree with the strategy they're using.

Do you, though? If so, what would be your strategy for establishing the fact of human moral significance without undermining or contradicting scienctific progress?",1579804047

&gt; 
&gt; This is totally, completely wrong. Kimura did not even so much as attempt to model this. He only asserted it without providing any evidence. It lies outside the scope of his model completely, as you can see by the fact that his DFE doesn't even bother to include beneficial ones.

I'm sorry to jump in here, but this is so egregious I have to comment. 

Have you read the actual paper from Kimura that you're talking about? The one where he says that he excluded beneficial mutations, and his rationale for doing so?

Lemme pull it up real quick:

&gt;The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.

So there are four options here. Either 1) Kimura is lying about what *his own model* shows wrt beneficial mutations, 2) *you* are lying about Kimura's work, 3) you are unfamiliar with Kimura's work, or 4) you're not even bothing to engage with Kimura's work directly and are just taking [Sanford's word](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95wubb/defend_sanford/) for it wrt Kimura's rationale.

Synonymous mutations do not alter coding sequence. And we use synonymous mutations to asses the consequence of NON synonymous mutations: that is how we know that non-synonymous changes, (i.e. actual alterations) are more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

As for Kimura, first it's a model, secondly he openly states that if beneficial mutations (things we know exist) are allowed in his model, they fix incredibly fast and evolution goes wild, and thirdly his model is built on the assumption (note, not observed fact) that 'mutations are slightly deleterious but effectively neutral', and may lead to a decline in fitness (in his model) of 10\^-7 per generation.

&gt;Sure, but the flu pandemic was not limited to people fighting in WWI. That's hardly a sufficient explanation for the data.

I explained that. Infection rates in parts of the world not effected by the war were not as devastating as those that were.

&gt;You're not getting it. Spanish flu is extinct. It's gone.

H1N1 isn't. It was last years dominant flu strain. The ""extinction"" in 1917 is readily explained by herd immunity due to its widespread infection in previous years. If, hypothetically a 1/3 of people had some immunity you wouldn't/couldn't get an outbreak until enough new, not immune people had been born to bring the herd immunity below 20%, probably much lower.

t1_ffbnted,t3_ercz37,"&gt; I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene. It is not a mechanism for trait creation.

Yeah, evolution works by modifying what already exists. But what we have here is a duplication event. This is literally the op And when we're talking about mutations in the structure, even a single mutation can cause drastic structural changes in protein folding, leading what literally a new protein that can perform a wide range of potential biochemical tasks.

&gt; ..this is believed, or hypothesized. The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures. There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt.  selection acts upon existing variability

Before we continue  down this trail, let's lay a couple of things of down so I know how to address you. It doesn't seem that you know what a gene is. 
Do you agree that;

1) Mutations occur in a variety of formats, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, inversions, deletions, duplications, all of which can either remove, modify or add nucleotide base pairs to an already existing template. 

2) Heritability occurs. 

Additionally, what exactly is a gene to you? Is a sequence of nucletides that have a start codon upstream and a stop codon downstream? Does a gene actually need to code for anything usefull? Does a gene always need to code for something? I'd really like to hammer down a precise definition of what a gene is at the molecular level. This will be helpful to make sure we're on the same page.

&gt; Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity. Diversity decreases via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves' mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry.

What do you mean by complexity? Would you mind giving me, not a real world example, but just a test example with the following sequence. I want to visualize what you're talking about:

AUGAGCTAGCTATCGATTAGTCGATGACGTAGTCGACGTACGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGTAGATACGCTCGCTACGTACGACTGACUAG

t1_ffc71fo,t3_es11qk,"&gt; Why would we want to suggest that all the present-day diversity in humans was created through mutations alone? Why would you think a creationist like myself would need to believe such a thing? 

The things you *need* to believe are the problem here, Paul.

By all means, present your testable, falsifiable hypothesis for extant human genetic diversity and show how your hypothesis fits the data more parsimoniously than ""humans as a species are \~100k+ years old and diversity is a consequence of steady mutational accumulation over those years"". 

As hypotheses go, ""humans mutate and have been around for a while"" is pretty simple, so good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto Lynch:

&gt; The fraction of amino-acid altering mutations that is deleterious enough to be removed by selection is approximated by C= 1-Kn/Ks, where Kn and Ks are the substitution rates at nonsynonomous and synonymous sites, respectively. If mutations are neutral on average, C, the proportion of ‘‘missing’’ amino-acid substitutions, would have an expected value of 0.0. However, in all taxa examined so far, average values of C are in excess of 0.7 (e.g., Ohta 1995; Eyre-Walkeret al. 2002), implying that the majority of amino-acid altering mutations are deleterious. 

So, take home messages here:

Most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious.

Well, yes.

And we can TELL most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious, BECAUSE THEY ARE SELECTED AGAINST.

And we can tell they are selected against, by comparing them to mutations that DO NOT alter amino acids.

Do you begin to see the problem? If all mutations were deleterious, we could not use C analysis. C is zero when *no* mutations are deleterious, or when *all* mutations are deleterious. C is not zero. 

Essentially, the Lynch position is that if a mutation ISN'T synonymous, then it probably does something. And that thing is more likely to be bad than good. This tells us nothing about synonymous mutations (other than they clearly accumulate more rapidly than nonsynonymous ones do), and tells us even less about mutations in regions that don't even code for anything.

Also, if you read the paper, it notes that generally ""mean"" fitness declines in MA experiments (as would be expected: most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious), but that individual line fitness *can* increase. MA experiments are conducted without selection pressure (that's sort of the point), and employ horrendous bottlenecking: if you add selection for fitness to this equation, it's pretty easy to see that in the wild less fit lines would be outcompeted by more fit lines.

t3_ess5i9,t3_ess5i9,"Great question!  Others here have pointed you toward cladistics, and that's exactly the thing you're asking about:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) .

The concept of ""clades"" and the subsequent study of ""cladistics"" came about because the classical Linnaean taxonomy -- kingdom, phylum, ..., genus, species -- is very well suited to placing a limited number of species in a nested hierarchy based on shared morphology, but not good at all for placing huge numbers of species in a hierarchy based on their ancestry.  This is because Linnaean taxonomy was developed before the theory of evolution, so it was not designed to include all the relationships needed to represent Universal Common Ancestry (UCA), nor all the species we now know about.  It makes the most sense to classify organisms based on ancestry, because that is primarily what determines all the other characteristics of the organism anyway (including morphology).

I was educated in the US, and we learned Linnaean taxonomy all the way up through high school.  When I learned about cladistics *at age 33 (!!!)* I was absolutely *floored*.  It immediately became obvious that *every clade represents a population of organisms that actually lived at some time*, whereas under Linnaean taxonomy it would be hard to argue that there was once a basal ""animal"" that started Kingdom Animalia.  Once I realized that, all of cladistics made sense:  it's a family tree full of ancestral organisms, rather than a bunch of bins that we categorize organisms into.

Check this out:   [https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/](https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/) .

It's a cladistic phylogeny explorer managed by Aron Ra.  Though many clades are uncertain or unnamed because science doesn't know enough about them, you'll quickly see that the ""web of life"" can't possibly be shoved into the Linnaean system without losing basically *all* information about common ancestry.

t1_ffbwd18,t3_esbgc1,"&gt;Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.

The 2009 strain was available for testing, and they didn't do it. It started off as extremely variant and declined over the course of a number of years. In that case they had an almost day by day sample library to draw from yet choose not to do a single fitness test. Its bewildering how someone can make the conclusion they did without doing a single test, when all the materials necessary for them to do them were easily available.

&gt;They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased.

No they simply assumed that, and came to their conclusion by ignoring other things that effect mortality. And yes they did ignore it, acknowledging that they exist isn't the same as factoring them into their model. We have rates of infection of H1N1 going back to the 1840's https://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/8107 and of course the data gets much better in the 20th century. Calculating herd immunity and infection rates is something that is easily doable by them and they simply didn't. That's ignoring data even if they acknowledge that it exists.

&gt;Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? 

Because H1N1 hadn't been seen in the world for 60+ years in 1917. No H1Nx strain had been seen for 40 years. Combine a population with no immunity at all, mobilize them for war in poor sanitary conditions no antibiotics, little to no knowledge of outbreak containment and you have a recipe for the disaster it became. Of course huge numbers of people contracted bacterial infections, millions of people were in close contact in the trenches, field hospitals, makeshift wards etc. 

There's also reasons why in parts of the world not as effected by the war the outbreak wasn't any worse then a typical bad fue season. Heck if you were over 65 in 1917 the worst pandemic in recent times wouldn't even qualify as a mild flu season.

&gt;if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1... ...I answered this here.

So there exists a way for a virus to increase in fitness. Lacking any knowledge of the future how in the friggen world can one make a determination about genetic entropy within a such a small snapshot in time?

&gt;Also addressed in the paper:

&gt;Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality

t1_ffbwkgl,t3_eseb2k,"&gt;So you couldn't find even one? I bet you tried

I actually didn't, because I did my homework and know that it's next to impossible to find an unbroken fossil lineage since there's numerous factors preventing that from occurring. You should ask u/DarwinZDF42 or u/Capercaillie, they're both scientists (geneticist and vertebrate zoologist respectively) and they can corroborate what I just told you. 

&gt;According to the evolutionary timescale there shouldn't be any! 

According to *basic rules of biology and geography*, it would be nearly impossible. The evolutionary timescale has almost nothing to do with it. 

&gt;Fossilisation doesn't just happen

Not at all what I said, but keep strawmanning me if you want. The more people here who see your dishonesty, the better. 

&gt;wonder why we actually find so many? 

Because the number of individual organisms guaranteed that some of them would be fossilized. There is also the fact that certain environments (e.g. mountainous regions, metamorphic rock, etc) are simply [not conducive to fossilisation](https://www.americangeosciences.org/education/k5geosource/content/fossils/under-what-conditions-do-fossils-form). 

&gt;A great big flood?

Let me give you an idea of *exactly* how stupid it is to think that a global flood could possibly provide us with the fossil record as we see it.

Creationists tend to invoke three flood-sorting mechanisms to explain the ordering of the fossil record. Each one is different, and each one is utter nonsense.

**Ecological zonation**: Patterns of fossil deposition in Noah's Flood can be explained as follows - The lower strata, in general, would contain animals that lived in the lower elevations. Thus, marine invertebrates would be buried first, then fish, then amphibians and reptiles (who live at the boundaries of land and water), and finally mammals and birds. Also, animals would be found buried with other animals from the same communities.

Problem 1: Whales, despite living in the same ecological strata as fish, aren't found anywhere at the bottom of the geological column. The same goes for mosasaurs like Tylosaurus

Problem 2: Modern mammal fossils aren't found anywhere alongside dinosaur fossils.

Problem 3: Birds are very much alive today, but pterosaurs aren't. Excluding the giants like Q, most pterosaurs occupied the same ecological niche as seagulls and passerines (songbirds) - Pteranodon is the most familiar fish-eating flyer to the public, and there's good reason to think small flyers like Anurognathus were insectivorous. Creationists have so far been remarkably quiet as to why this is the case.

**Hydrologic sorting** = The order of fossils deposited by Noah's Flood can be explained like so - Fossils of the same size will be sorted together. Heavier and more streamlined forms will be found at lower levels.

Cherry-picking at best, outright bullshit at worst. Massive creatures like Dunkleosteus are found in the earlier rock strata of the Devonian, but the actual titans of prehistory make their first appearances in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. And the heaviest animal on Earth, Big Blue has never been found in the rock record until long after the dinosaurs died off.

There's also **differential escape**, where smaller and faster creatures are discovered at higher positions in the geological column while bigger, slower beasts would have died and been buried at lower locales. Of course, this explanation implies that leviathans like Patagotitan ran faster than smaller creatures like Allosaurus and Dryosaurus.

&gt;Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds

&gt;I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, if humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

Now, on to YEC timelines, human evolution and the 'original genome'.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us imagine an encyclopedia that is 3 billion characters in length, written only in G, A, T and C.

I give you 7 billion copies, each of which has 25,000 random mistakes which they have acquired by being repeatedly copied *slightly* badly, 250 times.

Can you determine the original text of the encyclopedia with enormous confidence? Yes.

Each encyclopedia is ALREADY 99.999% correct, so that's a fantastic start.

Line them all up and look for the consensus characters at any query sites: job done.

Bonus points, because the mistakes are inherited (copies of copies of copies) you can also sort the encyclopedias into trees of relatedness which allow you to address any ambiguities that might need clarification. Any bottlenecks in the copying process will also jump out incredibly clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

If instead, you cannot do this (and you can't, because it turns out there are WAAAAAAAY more random mistakes than expected), it is telling us something important: as you said, 

&gt;  if you take an encyclopedia and copy it lots of times with mistakes each time and you destroy all the old copies such that we only have the current corrupted copy, it will get to a point where you will not be able to reliably reconstruct the original 

This is essentially correct. The fact we cannot do this means that there may NOT be an 'original' (there may have been several, and they themselves may have been copied from something else), and also, that an *awful lot of time has elapsed* since the earliest encyclopedias were transcribed.

&amp;#x200B;

And this latter scenario is exactly what we see. 

I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, *if* humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

The latter proposal (that humans are 6000 years old and suffered a bottleneck of 8 people 4500 years ago) is incredibly easy to test with the genetic data we have already (and have had for years). And the data absolutely does *not* support this proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

I also would caution against proposing that mutation rates may have changed over time, because your current position requires '100 per generation' to be so high that genetic entropy exists (even if we can't see it).

For neutral mutations, substitutions have no measurable effect whatsoever, and when we look at populations we see some individuals with one nucleotide, others with another. For some loci all four nucleotides are found within populations. How do we determine which nucleotide is the 'original' one, and which are the substitutions?

For actual evolutionary biology, this isn't a problem, because evolutionary biology doesn't propose that created, perfect genes exist or ever have existed. For creation it is *very* problematic: your position requires the human species to have been created with one (or perhaps two, depending on clonal creation of eve) genomes, and to have undergone only 100-250 generations, including a massive bottleneck down to 8 people at one stage. Human lineages only acquire \~100 mutations per generation, so any given genome must be therefore only 10,000-25,000 mutations from the original created genome. Identifying the 'correct' nucleotides (indeed identifying them for every loci) should be incredibly easy.

Not sure what you mean with this, and you didn't cite a source for your claim.

And it is also known that higher level multicellular life forms have a much smaller percentage of their genomes dedicated to protein-coding. Voila! Higher percentage of nearly neutral mutations, which means less effective selection.  


&gt; Yep. And the deleterious ones are selected against, the favourable ones are selected for, and the neutral ones allow drift. Voila: equilibrium.

We can now clearly show that hagfish retain all the associated features of vertebrates, and the genetics supports this ancestry too (they have the relevant vertebrae-associated genes, but just don't use them for that) so we have the tools to distinguish clades with secondary loss of traits from more distantly related clades that never had those traits.

Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.   


For another thing, their argument is based upon comparing the death statistics over time (which would correspond to the virulence of the strain). Virulence would correspond to the level of function of the virus--it's ability to replicate itself.  


They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased. That supports the predictions of GE, since it shows that mutations damage function.  


&gt;Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? Why did that phenomenon decrease as mutations in the flu increased?  


&gt; Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.   


No, they did not ignore that. They addressed it in the paper:  


**There have been major medical advances since 1918, and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1-related mortalities. Therefore, the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. However, while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918, such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world. Second, the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve, while medical advances have occurred in bursts (e.g., the breakthrough in antibiotics, and the more recent development of antivirals). Third, each of the great influenza pandemics (1918, 1956, 1968) involved the emergence of a new viral strain, which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe. This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance. Finally, the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1-related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.**   


&gt; if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago? 

I answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/esjgk4/ignorant_virus_headline_fail_virus_is_mutating/ffbv66f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year? 

I don't think you're referring to the same strain they are, which did first surface in the '17 pandemic:  


 **The H1N1 influenza A virus has been circulating in the human population for over 95 years, first manifesting itself in the pandemic of 1917–1918. Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. (From Background section)**  


&gt; does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance? 

Also addressed in the paper:  


**Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain.**",1579784948

This means that all dinosaurs already had avian respiration before some of them gave rise to birds, just like most all theropod dinosaurs already had feathers, and just like velociraptor already had the beginnings of what would become wings. The more recent transitions could fly better, would have their fingers fuse together, would lose their long tail, and would lose their teeth.

t3_ess5i9,t3_ess5i9,"Yes, there are examples. I'll provide one and explain how it works. 

Consider ""tetrapods"". ""Tetrapods"" refers to terrestrial vertebrates - amphibians, reptiles (including birds), and mammals - so named because they, or we, all have four limbs - tetra = 4, pod = leg/foot.

Snakes do not have four limbs. Snakes do not have any limbs. But they are tetrapods. 

How?

Because the groupings are based not on morphology, but on common ancestry. When we classify something as a ""tetrapod"", we're saying ""it shares a tetrapod common ancestor with all other tetrapods"", *not* ""it has four limbs"". 

So we can identify the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all tetrapods, the ancestral tetrapod from which all other tetrapods are descended. Anything descended from that MRCA is a tetrapod, even if it subsequently loses its limbs, as snakes have.

&gt;Where did the ability come from? You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this wasn't.

So you believe.  So you assume.  The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.   Is this proof of speciation?  Common ancestry?  Gene creation?  No.  It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions.  There is no structural changes to the genome.  The bacteria is not 'becoming!' another organism, or transitioning to a cockroach.

It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

&gt;So, you tell me: where did these bacteria get a set of enzymes that aren't present in any other members of their species that would not have been at all useful prior to man's nylon production?

You can believe it was 'mutation!', if you wish.  But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria.  Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.  It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

It is not a mechanism for common ancestry.   Mutation is an entropic process, that degrades an organism.  It does not increase complexity or create new genes, or 'evolve' into transitional genomic structures.",1579780435

t3_esr9ns,t3_esr9ns,"&gt; Does mutation 'create' genes?



&gt; No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!' Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.

Of course not. But genes, unlike cars, are passed on when we reproduce, and the offspring of carrier of the mutated gene has a 50% chance of having the mutation, and at that point they *are* new genes. This ain't rocket science.

&gt; I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry

Neither the word ""proof"" nor ""proves"" appears anywhere in that study, so as usual you are strawmanning the studies authors. 

I'm not sure how you could even come to the conclusion that we think it ""proves"" common ancestry. It provides exceptionally strong evidence for natural selection, and it shows that mutations can survive in a gene pool for many, many generations without providing any apparent benefit, both of which provide *evidence* for common ancestry, but it certainly doesn't ""prove common ancestry"".

I suppose it is possible that *someone* got careless and said something close to ""it proves common descent"", but the studies authors did not, and anyone with a decent understanding of epistemology would not make such a claim. It is a flagrant strawman to suggest that the community at large would make anything close to such a sloppy argument. 

&gt; Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  

Pretty sure no one believes that-- at least no one who actually has a clue how evolution works-- so this is yet another strawman. 

&gt; The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen

Sci fi imagines these things, yes, but they literally have *nothing* to do with evolution. They are not real. No one who understand evolution thinks things work like that. 

&gt;An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

Yes. But any mutation that leads to a change that is either not harmful (though not necessarily beneficial) or is not so harmful that it causes the bearer to be unable to reproduce, has a 50% chance of being passed on, in which case it is ""already there"" in the offspring. It might be passed on for millennia by pure happenstance before conditions change, or (as was the case in the Lenski experiment) a second mutation happens, that makes the mutation beneficial and *then* it be selected for.

*That is one of the key things that the Lenski experiment shows:* That mutations that are not fatally detrimental can stick around in the gene pool long enough to eventually become beneficial.  

Your entire argument seems to be based on not just a misunderstanding of the Lenski experiment, but apparently a complete lack of even caring about what it showed. 

&gt; The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.

Your argument might have more credibility if you had the slightest clue what you are talking about. An no, that is not an ad hominem. Your argument betrays that you do not understand the paper you are arguing against *at all.* It is perfectly reasonable and justified to point that out.",1579777193

Why? We already know that fossilization itself is an extremely rare process. We also know that a lot of fossils just do not survive the ravages of time due to exposure, scavengers, excess pressure in the rock the fossil gets buried in and loads of other problems. Even the best-quality [foram fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera#Evolutionary_significance) only go back to the mid-Jurassic. 

&gt;Not at all contrary to what evolution teaches.

Evolutionary theory says nothing about the quality of the fossil record, so this statement is nonsense. 

From your linked article:

&gt;Recent research has shown that Archaeopteryx skeletons had pneumatized vertebrae and pelvis. This indicates the presence of both a cervical and abdominal air sac, i.e. at least two of the five sacs present in modern birds

Neat! Unfortunately for creation.com, Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds, so this information is *completely unnecessary and pointless* in the context of the article. I also note that they didn't mention that bit of info, so bonus points for lying by omission. 

&gt;Ruben noted the problem for the dino-bird theory in general: how would the ‘bellows’-style lungs of reptiles evolve gradually into avian lungs? The hypothetical intermediate stages could not conceivably function properly, meaning the poor animal would be unable to breathe. One of the first stages would be a poor creature with a diaphragmatic hernia (hole in the diaphragm), and natural selection would work against this. 

Basic argument from ignorance. ""We don't know how this could have happened, therefore it couldn't have happened."" Also...

[""When Brocklehurst and his colleagues used CT scans to compare the structure of the lung cavities of 4 modern crocodilians and 29 modern birds with those of 16 dinosaurs from across the dinosaur family tree, they found that all of the dinosaurs had vertebrae more similar in shape to those of birds than those of reptiles. This suggests the dinosaur vertebrae jutted into the lung cavity as they do in birds.""](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2183495-bird-like-lungs-may-have-helped-dinosaurs-rule-the-world/)

Allow me to take a slightly different tact.

Before the advent of nylon production by humans, nylon and associated chemicals did not exist in the natural environment of earth.  There are, living today, populations of bacteria that can and do digest byproducts of nylon production.  We have samples of the same species of bacteria living in pouted areas that can digest such materials and samples from elsewhere that simply do not posses the ability.

Where did the ability come from?  You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this isn't.  You claimed mutation can't give rise to novel genes.  And yet the original strain discovered possessed three enzymes that were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by related bacteria, and they were not effective on any other material besides man-made nylon byproducts.

So, you tell me: where did these bacteria get a set of enzymes that aren't present in any other members of their species that would not have been at all useful prior to man's nylon production?

And while you're at it, tell me why later work on a bacterial species from an entirely different Phylum of bacteria evolved a similar ability that wasn't present in them beforehand when presented with an appropriate environment for such evolution to occur and in a manner which did not involve the same enzymes witnessed in the first.",1579776210

https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene.  It is not a mechanism for trait creation.


&gt;Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population.

..this is believed, or hypothesized.   The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures.   There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt. 

*selection acts upon existing variability*

&gt;Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity.  Diversity *decreases* via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves'  mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry. 

&gt;These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited.

This is believed, only.  There is no evidence for this, just conjecture and plausibility. There is no evidence of any gene or trait being 'created' via mutation.  It is always a deleterious process, and can only be labeled 'neutral!' by decree.

It is like wrecking your car.  It may still be driveable, and maybe the rattle you had before is gone now, but the accident did not create a new car.

By the way, the answer to my question was &gt;!whales!&lt; - that's how different creatures can become after diverging from their common ancestor. 

&gt;How has classification not gone absurd, how are there only a handful?

As Sweary_Biochemist has [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eseb2k/show_your_work_for_evolution/ff9uik5/), it already *is* absurd, mainly because evolution never actually stops, but we keep trying to pigeonhole critters into neat little boxes when that's not really appropriate.",1579772113
t1_ffb9ikm,t3_eseb2k,"And do this a few more times and the transitions blend together so that when you look from one generation to the next they are always going to be the same species, but there were no Homo sapiens over if you go back far enough with the closest thing you’ll find having the characteristics of Homo rhodesiensis. Go back further and same process. The names of the groups are unimportant because those are a human construct but go back more than a million years and suddenly the animals most like us are currently called Homo erectus. 

Evolution does not **EVER** say anything about one species of animal giving birth to another species of animal. What happens instead is a slow process like a gradient. There is no instance where it stops being Homo rhodesiensis and transforms into Homo sapiens suddenly all at once, but if we were to have ever generation of photos you ask for if we were to compare the organisms living 350,000 years ago to those living 300,000 years ago there would be enough of a noticeable difference that we might decide to call them different things and around 325,000 years ago we might disagree about which group to place those organisms because they fit exactly halfway between both groupings we came up with. The mother born 325,000 years ago and her daughter born some time later like 324,980 years ago will be exactly the same species. They are only ever classified as *different* species when they are clearly different enough to consider them different groups just like we don’t have wild wolves giving birth to poodles though they’re clearly the same species. The amount of change involved doesn’t happen all at once but when we compare the modern versions of each they are clearly different enough from each other that we call one “poodle” and the other “wolf.” 

Something similar happened as one lineage branches off leading to neanderthalensis and the other branches off leading to sapiens. At first they were still extremely similar and we’d still call them heidelbergensis but eventually around 70,000 years ago when they came back in contact with each other they were clearly different enough to classify into different categories even though they were not yet different enough to cut off the ability to produce fertile hybrids like how we can still make a mix of domestic dog and gray wolf. Clearly different enough to call them different things but not different enough to kill the ability to interbreed. If we simply add time and continued genetic isolation we get to something like horses and donkeys or lions and tigers that look even more different and though they can still produce offspring these offspring are infertile so that the lineages never blend back together. Even more time and they can’t produce any offspring at all like cats and dogs, rabbits and mice, humans and gorillas. At the same time, the morphological differences are even more dramatic so that the split is classified above the genus level providing us with carnivores, glires, and apes in each of these cases. This is the family level in linnean classification and genetics along with whatever fossils we happen to find provide us a bit of information about the higher levels of classification as each clade above species is the result of speciation much like explained above with horses and donkeys. Each clade below is generally based on how things look different, with more significant differences at the level of subspecies (like Homo sapiens sapiens compared to Homo sapiens idaltu or Canis lupus lupus compared to Canis lupus familiaris) than there is as the breed or ethnic group. With humans it gets a bit tricky because despite us being able to tell if someone had recent ancestry in one of several continents based, the population is blended to a high degree so that usually any given European might be a mix of German, English, Norwegian, and French all at once. There is so much blending this way all the way back that even what we call German consists of multiple Haplogroups found in other locations as well. With something like dogs it is more clear cut, because dog breeders have more control over keeping a dog a “purebred.”

The smaller more isolated groups tend to have less diversity than the larger ones and for humans the most biodiversity is still contained in Africa, so that everyone else is related to one of the same people around 70,000 years ago that left Africa but we have to go back to around 300,000 years to get to the most recent common ancestor of all of us.

&gt;The only objective factor here, when it comes to the virus, is simply how many viruses are being produced, and how quickly. A virus with a large burst size creates more viruses per infected cell; a virus with a fast burst time is reproducing more quickly.

Sanford and co didn't actually do any other fitness tests, specifically the one you describe. By what metric do you gauge reproductive success, since the method you specifically mention aasnt measured?

&gt;We can therefore see that we should expect to see an inverse correlation between mortality rates and the virus’ ability to replicate—as the virus reproduces less efficiently, 

Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.

There's also a number of other questions you've never addressed. 

- if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago?

- there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year?

- H1N1 while extinct managed to be last years dominant flu strain... why is that? Why was it extremely common among children born after 2009?

- does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance?",1579747617

IK that the article claims to address this because deaths from Flu tend to be secondary causes, but that claim misses the point.

It's easy to see that a virus that ""ideally"" produces a ton of copies but makes you so sick you can't leave the toilet is not going to be as transmissible as a virus which is more mild.

Half correct. Viruses do not ""know anything"".

Your objective factors are wrong, though: all that matters is propagation. Churning out billions of progeny viruses at the cost of killing the host can *massively hinder propagation*.

There are many strategies that are of varying degrees of success in different scenarios, and very few of them rely on 'host killing'. Herpex viruses, for instance, will infect and then become latent for years on end (suppressing their own replication), resurging when the immune system is stressed enough to make a resurgence viable, and spreading by direct contact. Then they go latent again.

This works really well, but by the Carter/Sanford criteria, this represents...what, sinusoidal entropy?

Basically, lethality is a terrible metric for viral 'fitness': H1N1 is a zoonotic virus, and like many zoonotic viruses, it behaves oddly in novel hosts. Swine flu and bird flu are endemic in pigs and birds (respectively), and there they are well-tolerated, which is what selection will inevitably favour. Cross the species barrier to humans, and what works in pigs/birds suddenly is non-optimal, and we see a much higher mortality. Over time, this lowers, both as a consequence of herd immunity, medical intervention, and selection for less-lethal behaviour. Viruses that kill their hosts tend to be weaned out very quickly, because dead hosts are terrible at spreading viruses (note that Ebola, while terrifying, generally ends up producing fairly geographically-limited outbreaks, because dead people can't wander around spreading virus).

The ideal adaptive process for a virus is to reach a state where it is both endemic and essentially asymptomatic, unable to be purged from the population and able to spread freely. 

This has, for example, worked incredibly well for the retroviruses that make up a substantial fraction of our genome.",1579735796

The results are not even as complex as a plant or an animal as the cell differentiation is more or less between growing the organism and dying to break off extremities or something else about as simple. It doesn’t come close to showing the development of an internal fluid filled body cavity, nerve cells, organs, or anything like that found in the more complex organisms. 

Somewhat related, but not necessarily going to provide any additional insight into the evolution of a unique trait is how we can grow organs and pieces of organs from stem cells.

t1_ffa40yj,t3_es11qk,"&gt; Plus, they have simpler genomes meaning there is a much lower percentage of near neutrals to begin with. Most of their genome is protein-coding, if I'm not mistaken 

Doesn't stop drift: in fact smaller bacterial genomes seem to drift faster than larger genomes. Still not genetic entropy (and typically fitness increases instead). Either way you slice it, this represents a equilibrium scenario (that thing you claim cannot exist): mutations occur, populations drift, fitness typically increases because that's just how life be, and genetic entropy isn't real.

&gt; No, there isn't. Mutations keep happening all the time.

t1_ff9ez1h,t3_eseb2k,"And it’s actually more than a half a million sequential fossils because of heredity and sexual reproduction. There will be some along the way with traits that didn’t get passed on but even among just the ones that did we have to consider the problem of having two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents and so on just in our recent ancestry. Eventually these lineages converge on a smaller number of individuals like about 10,000 **per generation** instead of the continuation of the exponential growth and there’s no way we’d find them all in a timely manner if they happened to be perfectly preserved and most of them aren’t. The actual evidence we do have tells us which populations gave rise to which subsequent populations, especially when considering whole clades all at once and how they changed from the origin of one clade to the origin of the subsequent daughter clade. We may never be able to pinpoint every single individual along the way. For the most ancient ancestry we rely mostly on genetics, but around 540 million years ago some lineages started to leave behind more preserved fossils, and then for the last 2-3 million years we can do a bit better by being able to provide a sequence of which species gave rise to which subsequent species and it isn’t until the last 400-500 years that we can even remotely get anything resembling a family tree consisting of every specific individual along any specific branch along the way to any specific living individual.

Because trillions of generations just in our lineage and trillions more for every other one and we shouldn’t be able to find the ground through all of this carnage. Now the same thing still applies to just small steps in our evolutionary progression if the loss of the external tail wasn’t an all at once event and it’s not like we can expect to find the exact organisms that led to us still perfectly preserved so that we could create a slide show of pictures 15 or 20 million slides long for every direct female ancestor of humans. Also this poses another major problem, even if all them happened to be preserved, because we each have two parents that each had two parents which each had two parents and when we account for inbreeding between some of our lineages we do eventually drop back down to about 10,000 individuals pretty consistently all the way back but now we’re talking about more fossils than anyone has any time to post or find for 60 million years of monkeys slowly becoming human including the ape characteristics of losing a tail. 

There’s no way OP can be serious here, and it’s not like they’d look if we could provide what they ask for. This isn’t going to happen, not just because the vast majority of what they ask for isn’t preserved or we can’t identify which specific individuals were direct parents of which other specific individuals if we did (just based on the bones, especially) but the amount of time necessary for this isn’t going to add much to what we already know. No rational person needs this. Like you implied, we can still be sure we drove from point A to point B even when we blink or look away from the road along the way.

Why is there so much drama over it, then? People act like science is literally dying if others don't agree with their opinion on what is more plausible.

&gt;I think /r/creation was discussing 'redpilling' us with the simulation hypothesis.

That's kind of out of the scope of this sub, but it would be an interesting play. If we're in a simulation, that opens up the possibility of supernatural manipulation from outside of the Sim, and none of it is falsifiable. But that's more of a metaphysics argument than an origins one.

&gt;There's still no reason in reality to accept that humans were originally formed intact from mud and wind in the last ten thousand years as a brute fact: it's just something somebody wrote in a book way too long ago.

Well, humans by our nature trust each other by default. If we're told that it's true, then we have a reason that is sufficient to make it a default unless there is undeniable evidence otherwise. That trust is not a defect, either. There's pretty good science that appears to recognize it as a significant adaptive win and not a side-effect of some other survival strategy.... So if we don't have enough proof to answer the question of origins beyond any doubt, then we're going to keep believing what we've been told by people we trust.

Given the choice between upsetting that adaptive and beneficial, natural trust and ""agreeing to disagree"" in an area where we're unlikely to ever have all the answers nailed down to documented, repeatable, verifiable, undeniable certainty, why choose to fight?

t1_ffa7rnv,t3_es5qk3,"It took me a few times of reading to try to process what you’re saying. So basically because of homology (and other things) we know how organisms are related and not something like we assume different groups are related and then we cherry pick out what they share in common and then use what we cherry pick to show they are related? If this is what you’re getting at, it is like Kent Hovind arguing that phylogenetics is just a bunch of us drawing lines on paper because of some similarities we find asking why we don’t say that birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects are all the same group because they fly using wings and why we don’t group organisms together based on how many chromosomes they have or if they have hooves without comparing any other trait. He’s also famous for asking to present what scientists declare to be *closely* related organisms in attempt to debunk phylogeny as evidence of evolutionary relationships when he provided the groups of “elephants” and “pine trees.” Why are they not the same? Because they look different and can’t interbreed. Not only did the lineages leading to both diverge something like 1.8 billion years ago but the actual evidence for how they are related is found within the individual cells - and this is related to homology. Organisms that diverged a very long time ago won’t look anything alike superficially but they’ll still have some structural similarities because of shared ancestry like endosymbiotic mitochondria, cell nucleus, stacked golgi bodies, and so forth. We have many of the same organelles and we have more genes in common with plants than we have in common with bacteria or archaea. 

Of course, he probably provided the answers he provided because he didn’t think we could find any shared homologies and then he made the mistake of saying a god is necessary for the creation of broccoli. These are the types of arguments typically presented by mainstream creationists but they’ve been getting more creative lately and despite their total failure they’ll suggest morphological similarities are evidence of common design and should be caused by the same genes because that how these traits are expressed. That’s really the best they have until you look at the details because everything else falls flat for being completely wrong or self refuting. 

Six mutations in a population causes extinction? No, every human zygote accumulates about 21 times that many. A population of one should die before it is ever born if this was the case. Inbred populations have reduced genetic diversity. Yes, but this is why we know humans aren’t the product of inbreeding 4350 years ago before we even look into evolution. Natural selection doesn’t add diversity. That’s correct, but without variety caused by mutation this mechanism can’t drive a population towards a subset of them - it would likely have no effect at all as a purifying mechanism. Whole clades that arose tens or hundreds of millions of years ago are related. Well yea. How does this help support the alternative? Genetic entropy, devolution, deteriorating genes - none of this happens and if it did and we were created the designer wasn’t very intelligent so that’s another shot against intelligent design. And now we get “homology is circular reasoning” which already fails to support any alternatives except for small superficial changes on top of fundamental similarities because we don’t just look at several superficial similarities- we compare whole genomes, we compare embryonic development, we compare the workings of the cell, we compare all of the things that are the defining characteristics of every clade as they arose over time and to fit within a daughter clade they must first have the defining characteristics of the parent clade or a known mechanism for the loss of one or many of those defining characteristics or fossil transitions showing that their group once had but subsequently lost one or more of those traits. That’s why phylogeny is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the evolutionary history of life on this planet. Morphological and genetic homology plays a big role in determining the placement of these organisms and it only works when nothing ever outgrows its ancestry when it gives rise to diversity and subsequent daughter clades. If suddenly mammals had the same feather as dinosaurs like birds or if salamanders started developing pectoral mammary glands and prehensile tails like monkeys we’d be a bit shocked and when evolution could no longer explain it we’d have to investigate other options. Since this doesn’t happen, creationists can’t demonstrate that it does and they can’t provide a mechanism for what doesn’t happen. They can only complain about the evidence that proves them wrong as they act like it doesn’t.",1579731641

I believe in God and in a will and intent behind how life works and how we are in particular, but to answer one basic part of your question, we can look at lab science, because we've seen single celled organisms change into multicellular organisms (though rather basic) in a lab.

The way it works is pretty simple... When a single celled organism reproduces, it doubles and then splits. The most basic change, the one we've seen in the lab, is a generational shift from doubling and splitting, to doubling and hanging around in a clump. This behavior is determined by genetics in a way that can develop due to selective pressure, like the presence of a predator that eats small things but not big clumps, and then persist in the population even when that predator is removed.

That doesn't say much about how a clonal clump can change into organs and stuff... I expect it's a more significant change, and one that is harder to induce in a lab, but I wouldn't be surprised if science comes up with, or already has, a plausible natural explanation for it.

t1_ff9k920,t3_eseb2k,"The category names we give to clades are arbitrary, for convenience. And the more we learn, the less convenient the larger categories actually are. 

It is not, after all, like a single carnivore ancestor suddenly splurged into multiple carnivore descendant lineages all in one go, it's bifurcating lineages all the way, and not all happening at the same time: with one arbitrary carnivore clade (say, feliformes) there will be lineages that diverged more recently, while others that diverged longer ago, and lineages within lineages within lineages, none of which is adequately conveyed by sticking them all in a box and stamping ""feliformes"" on it. And as we learn more we start trying to wedge things into the gaps awkwardly, hence suborder, and then the even uglier infraorder.

A more accurate system is to list all the known divergences in a given species' ancestry, but this can get....very, very long.

And as you note, evolution never actually STOPS, so any given lineage will either die out or diverge into yet more lineages, while the Linnaean taxonomic hierarchy is kinda only appropriate for a static snapshot of lineages and ancestries as they appear NOW, to us. And as noted, it's not even great at that (next up, subinfraorder! Then infrasubinfraorder!)

Basically, the one unit we actually *can* use is ""species"", because it describes what we have *at any given moment*, but it's consequently always moving along with time, and what is a species today may in years to come be the ancestral population from which thousands of new species descend.

Biology is messy, and is under no obligation to conform to the neat categories we like to use. Taxonomic categories are arbitrary and not actually very good at detail, and are also not dynamic. As time passes, if we stick with broad-strokes box-putting exercises, probably 'species' will remain the front runner (with the little tentative feelers of 'subspecies' running just ahead), and we'll keep kingdom/phylum etc and just invent more arbitrary terms to fill in the new subdivisions introduced between 'species' and everything left behind.",1579721660

t1_ff8wu9h,t3_ercz37,"&gt;I have just presented ONE point.. natural selection.. to examine. I submit that the observable phenomenon of selection is a devolving process, not an increasing complexity process. 

No, you introduced multiple other points, in addition to natural selection, by saying these things in your OP:

&gt;Natural selection and breeding, are DEVOLUTION processes.. the organism is becoming LESS diverse, genetically, with fewer traits to pick from, in their lottery pick of genes.   
&gt;  
&gt;Natural selection is evidence AGAINST common ancestry, and does not provide any evidence that it can or did happen.

By asserting that the mechanics of natural are evidence against UCA, you are *forcing* everybody here to bring up mutation, because *the entire theory of evolution, not just selection, is relevant to a discussion of UCA*.  You can't just try to limit the conversation to half of the thing you're discussing.

So let's look at my quotes from your OP:

* Yes, selection is a process by which alleles are culled from a population, and each selection event generally results in a less diverse population.  I don't know what the definition of ""devolution"" is, so perhaps this does fit your definition of that term.
* HOWEVER, even though the above is true, it is NOT true that there is a ""lottery pick"" of genes.  Every generation introduces new mutations into the population, so that the number of alleles in the population (diversity) is generally *increased by mutation* and generally *decreased by selection*.  Over many generations, the diversity of the population will increase if mutation introduces more variation than selection removes -- or diversity will decrease if selection removes more variation than mutation introduces.
* Selection is not evidence against UCA, because everybody knows that selection is not the only process by which evolution occurs.  It is invalid to consider selection separately from all other mechanisms of evolution (and ignore all the other mechanisms), for the purpose of claiming that selection is evidence against UCA.  That's like ignoring the 7 in ""7+1+1=9"" and saying it doesn't add up.  It's like ignoring the engine in a car and saying the car can never get anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And of course, every organism can only draw from the 'lottery pick' of the gene pool they have. I am surprised you dispute this. 

As I have said, mutation generally adds random elements to the genome of every organism.  If you'd like to dispute whether mutation happens, then please provide your evidence.  If you want to save that for another post, that's fine -- just admit that selection alone can't be used as evidence against UCA.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to have a valid discussion of selection OR UCA, you cannot pretend that selection is the only thing which affects the viability of the UCA theory.",1579716472

So I'm still on the fence about genetic entrophy and leaning towards not accepting the theory.

However debate evolution is wrong!

I don't think the ""most mutations are neutral"" theory holds much weight.  Based on my very limited research it seems to me that we're not sure whether most mutations are deleterious or neutral, more research needs to be done and arguments either way is speculation.

If this is the article they're talking about with John Sanford's H1N! study

This indicates to me that debateevolution is pulling up stuff out of thin air and knowingly transmitting inaccurate to make fallacious points again, which is something I've accused them of doing repeatedly in the past and why I no longer engage with them.

Why not instead investigate how easy it is to lose traits like tails? It is unlikely to be as gradual as you demand: generally speaking, you either need a tail or you don't. 

If you need it, you'll keep it, and chance mutations that result in tail truncation will be selected against. 

If you don't need it, you will still keep it until a chance mutation results in tail truncation. With no selective pressure to act against this, there's a fairly good chance this mutation will persist. And now your tail is gone. It could be as abrupt as a few generations.",1579711577

The post in question:

&gt;You're acting as if the statements made by those guys can be trusted. They cannot. Error catastrophe has been witnessed in nature (See Carter &amp; Sanford's H1N1 paper), and it has also been induced (or nearly induced, at least) through mutation accumulation or mutagenesis experiments (for just one example you can look at the Phage T7 experiment mentioned at creation.com/fitness). This is the reason why mutagenesis is used as a treatment for viral infections. If error catastrophe weren't real, then that would be a bogus treatment. Don't listen to their propaganda: error catastrophe is freely recognized by population geneticists. They aren't debating about it being a real thing; that's just the non-expert commentators dishonestly prattling.

First, H1N1 [didn't/isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ead3r/noahs_flood_genetics_not_so_much_xpost_from/dq3u81i/) [experiencing](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfivw6/all_in_one_place_a_detailed_response_to/f35pi9q/) [""genetic entropy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ajkw3w/so_just_a_final_update_on_carter_sanfords_h1n1/).

And finally, yes, mutagenic treatments exist for viruses (well, one does: a drug called ribavirin), but there are two problems with PDP's statement. First is that, even if it works exclusively via mutagenesis, it causes *lethal mutagenesis*, which is a broader phenomenon than *error catastrophe*. Lethal mutagenesis is just so many mutations the target dies. Can be all at once, or building up over time. Lethal mutagenesis is *specifically* referring to accumulation over time. To the extent we can tell, ribavirin acts via the former, but not the latter. But second, it's not even clear ribavirin works via lethal mutagenesis. [It has a bunch of other effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483), and the degree to which one or some combination of these are responsible for the observed effects has not been determined.

t1_ff8tsja,t3_ercz37,"&gt;1. Increasing complexity, and levels of diversity.

By increasing complexity, would we be talking about the development of new genes for new cellular processes such as growth characteristics, metabolism, cellular components? 

What would we be able to measure to show this? I'm not trying to be annoying or funny when asking the same question, I just want to make sure I address your question correctly. IF we expect an increase in complexity, we expect to find ""_____"". What would that look like to you on the molecular level? 

Just to be clear, when I say molecular level, let's focus on the monomer level of cellular components, such as amino acids, fatty acids, nucleotide, and any modifications that can happen therein, such as individual sugar attachment, hydroxyl, ethyl or methyl groups. I think focusing at that level of cellular organization will help us better deduce what emergent properties occur as a result. 



&gt;2. New traits, that were not already present in the parent stock.

I'm going to answer this, but I have a few questions as well. 

Could you explain to me in your own words how this is different than an increase in complexity? Is this a specific type of an increase in complexity? 

A common example, which you've probably already heard of, is the evolution of E. coli strains able to utilize citrate as an energy resource aerobically, which is the result of modifications to a gene from a duplication event. This is a new trait that was not present in any other strain ever identified up until that point. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) is some information on the original experiment. They went through about 50,000 generations (probably should give a few thousand), with the mutation occurring ~30,000. This may seem like a lot of generations, however the pressures weren't the strongest. [Other studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800869/) have achieved similar, but different, duplication and point mutation events leading to the same utilization with cultures exposed under conditions designed to produce this at a quicker rate, such as 12 generations. Here we have novel characteristics never seen prior to 2008 in any wilt type population.


&gt;3. Selection pressures causing diversity, and increases in complexity, as the organism adapts to changing conditions.

This is what Darwin observed on the island. Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population. This can be tracked by measuring changes that occurred within the genome. 

If I can ask a question in response to this: Let's temporarily agree that humans evolved from apes. What increase in complexity and novel genes occurred as a result, and what molecular-level changes occurred to allow this to happen?

&gt;4. Infrequent 'low levels of diversity', as a mechanism for increasing complexity and new traits would add, not diminish, traits needed for survival.

I'm honestly confused, would you mind rephrasing this? I'm not sure what you're saying, sorry.

&gt;5. Observable, repeatable, definable mechanism(s) for increasing complexity.

We can refer back to question 2 about this. That experiment has been repeated a couple times, with citrate usage occurring after environmental pressure, with populations incurring separate mutation events to accomplish the same goal energy resource utilization. 

We know genes are inherited, passed down from parent to offspring (with few exceptions, such as horizontal gene transfer). Mutations occur because cellular replication is not perfect (duplication's, inversions, deletions, etc....), and environmental pressures such as UV radiation and cyclic oxygen compounds can alter individual nucleotide. Sometimes tautermerization temporarily alters a nucleotide structure, where a polymerase reads it wrong and produces the wrong copy. Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

If mutations occur and are inherited, this is how evolution occurs. Just like how we can measure the changes in E. coli over time, we can measure the changes that acquired between humans and chimps. We know exactly what mutations occurred, the genomes of both species has been sequenced thousands of times. These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited. We can go into some bioinformatic analysis if you'd like and play around with some numbers. We can analyze the genome of these species together, if you have the time.",1579711340

Devolution isn’t a thing. There is no end goal. Losses and gains of features are the same process working in all directions at the same time such as viruses that lost their more complex features necessary for being considered alive and how humans have gained a lot more complexity than their distant ancestor that they share with these viruses. Same process operating in different directions because there isn’t anybody guiding it along and in both cases an increased survival benefit despite completely different outcomes.

To get felines that are different from each other from a common ancestor or canids you start with a single breeding population, which has natural variation due to mutation, and you split them up so that cheetahs don’t breed with bobcats and neither of them breed with house cats and then among the house cats you get further variation due to mutation selected for by humans to get shaggy haired cats, bald cats, and cats with short hair. For dogs the same process in nature creates wolves, wild dogs, and coyotes and then wolves - just two or three varieties, are turned into several hundred breeds because of purification and hybridization to get poodles, greyhounds, Dalmatians, Great Danes, Rottweilers and German shepherds among others.

t1_ff8bc6s,t3_er0vih,"&gt;Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly?

That's a very big point to gloss over. The fact that it is only being 'considered' neutral, rather than actually being neutral, is a very big deal. Those mutations are not going to be weeded out by natural selection because they are too small. They are ""flying under the radar"". They also just so happen to amount to the majority of all mutations in general. Most mutations are very small in this way. So that means most mutations are outside the scope of NS to remove or weed out. And lastly most mutations are damaging. You add all this together and what you get is inevitable decline, which is the exact opposite of evolution. That's why this is important.

t1_ff696tx,t3_ercz37,"&gt;Look at the haplogroups I linked, there is no way to fit those into a single starting originator ancestor without mutations.

I don't follow the reasoning.  Mutations have been followed in organisms from the mt-MRCA. ..the first traceable organism in each haplotype.  The parent canid produced all the variety we see today, and probably more, that has not come up in the 'lottery pick' of gene selection. They had a mutation rate, that has been measured, and can be followed in subsequent generation (for those mutations that are passed on).

There is no conflict with the phylogenetic trees in each haplotype.  Humans spread across the planet, carring their inherited genes to lower diversity 'tips' in the human tree.  They settled in homogeneous isolation, with unique morphological traits defining them.  They could still interbreed with other humans.. they only had cosmetic, or slight morphological differences..  not enough to isolate reproductively. 

Their mutations could be followed, and a rate calculated.  Environmental pressures 'selected' the trats most beneficial for survival, though humans showed ingenuity in overcoming deficiencies in their physical traits.

Eskimos,  for example,  have little body hair.  Thick fur would seem like a 'good thing' for their adaptation. They did not freeze while waiting for evolution to provide them with this, but covered themselves with animal skins and fur, to compensate for their lack.

Some Sicilians,  otoh, are very hairy, even though they live in a warmer climate where a fur coat would not be essential to survival. 

Humans have the unique ability to adapt with ingenuity,  and are not dependent on the time and chance of evolving traits to adapt.  Natural selection is not as important of a 'selective' process, among humans,  because they have other means to survive in changing conditions.   

But most other organisms are completely dependent on their EXISTING genes, to draw from, to adapt. Natural Selection can only draw from existing variability..  it is not a 'creative' process.",1579697711

There is nothing in SELECTIVE pressures that exhibits increasing complexity..  the opposite occurs.  There is no evidence that natural selection (or man directed breeding) has any ability or mechanism for increasing complexity or common ancestry.  It does the EXACT OPPOSITE.

Most intronic sequence is indeed basically useless (and accumulates mutations far, far more rapidly than coding sequence). There are many mammalian transgenes that are used both for research and therapeutically that are simply extant genes with the massive bulk of their introns stripped out (usually because we have to do so: dystrophin, for example, is 2.4 million bases long, but with introns removed, only 14000: 99.5% of it is just...intron). 

They work just fine, with the interesting facet that a gene carrying even a SINGLE intron will be expressed more readily than one with no introns, even if that intron is just filler sequence. The very act of recruiting a spliceosome seems to bolster transcript stability.

All of those breeds of domesticated dog are clearly different from each other so that we can classify them into different groups like “chihuahua” or “Great Dane” or “golden retriever.” They also share some striking similarities too, so not only do we know they are all the same “kind” of animal because of human involvement in selective breeding but we can look to their known evolutionary progression in recorded history, in their genetics, and in their morphology- especially shared homology. We know domesticated dogs are a subspecies of wolf. We know that wild dogs, coyotes, and foxes are all part of the same group despite wolves, domestic dogs, and coyotes being inter-fertile to varying degrees and wild dogs being too different genetically to breed with domesticated gods despite looking almost the same. The same thing applies to horses, zebras, and donkeys but to a smaller degree because these animals can make hybrids that are sterile despite looking like the same kind of animal. 

The same process that we use to develop dog breeds is the same process that natural selection uses to develop subspecies. Subspecies that don’t interbreed might result in different species that can still produce sterile offspring for awhile or they may form a ring species but eventually as the differences continue to pile up on top of the fundamental similarities they fully diverge into different populations no longer able to inter-breed at all. Then, they are no longer bound to wind up blending back together like could happen if we made a hybrid of all known dog breeds, for example, and selected for that while killing off everything that wasn’t a mix of at least two previous breeds along the way. Selective breeding creates divergent populations faster than natural selection normally does because we can control for the desired traits while in nature they (the animals) tend to select for something resembling their own group even in populations that actively breed in a way that results in the most diversity in that population. Like how humans tend to avoid close relatives, the same applies in the wild with other groups. While we don’t typically try to breed with non-humans (and not that it would produce any offspring anymore anyway) we do have this tendency to blend the traits of the entire local population together so that local populations can be told apart from foreign ones until the advent of high speed travel, anyway. 

The whole idea of different kinds of life created separately isn’t consistent among the groups pushing the idea nor is it consistent with the scientific data. The  Earth is more like 4.6 billion years old and not less than 10,000 years. There are cities older than they think the entire universe was and whole civilizations that don’t mention the flood that never happened as they also apparently lack any knowledge of Yahweh as they are building monuments to pagan gods during the time that the flood waters were supposedly pouring in with their own documents about different floods in different locations at different times for different reasons with different fluids involved. The ones most similar to the biblical account are from a region where several stories about it include a whole pantheon of gods - the one who created people being the one who warns the Utnapishtim, the Atrahasis, or the Xiusudra while the rest send the flood waters. Obviously it wasn’t global, but archeological evidence does support a localized flood. The creation story in the Bible and altered a bit for the Quran is also a lot like a collection of several stories from that region combined into the two different versions in the first two chapters in Genesis that they like to assume are part of the same event. 

When we are comparing science to the biblical version of creation there’s already a clear winner here so they like to mask it as intelligent design instead allowing for different creation stories in some cases. And we’re supposed to believe they have science on their side? I think not.",1579686314

Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly? Realistically as far as I can tell, the practical application of neutral theory is to provide a null hypothesis for testing selection vs genetic drift. How does it support genetic entropy? These mutations may change some aspect of the genome, but that doesn’t support a slow degradation over time that will not be stopped.

As i said variation is relative to need, at least as a option, and not proof of the origin. In other words your looking at clusters only. There is no reason to see diversity as anything but a need to diversify. its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive. 

Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity  to others.

Finally nothing has shown genetic change comes only, or at all, by mutations. they just presume that because they have no other idea of a mechanism to change dna. Yet I am confident genetics changing with/alongside bodyplans changing is not about mutations as a chance thing.

You are not correct. Kimura's 1979 paper (which I've quoted many times now) explains neutral theory in depth. All mutations are assumed to have a fitness effect, but it's a spectrum and at a certain point the fitness effect becomes too weak to overcome the effect of randomness that overrides it.

To quote modern population genetics:

&gt;The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely
that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it
has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some
effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However,
there is a class of mutations that we can term effectively
neutral. These are mutations for which Nes is much less
than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random
genetic drift.

doi.org/10.1038/nrg2146.

So there are two different categories of neutral mutations: strictly neutral  (no fitness effect at all) and effectively neutral. Neutral theory says that all neutral mutations are really of the 'effectively neutral' class, and there are no 'strictly neutral' mutations because all genetic changes have some effect, even if it's only very tiny.",1579663116

t1_ff7s72e,t3_er0vih,"&gt;How they propagate in a population is exactly what I am talking about.

It's not though. Your first premise of GE is:  
1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations 

Which I just showed is false.  


The third premise of GE is:   
3)  The vast majority of mutations are damaging 

Which I also just showed is false.   


Both of these premises say nothing about how ""alleles propagate in a population."" They make functional claims about the nature of mutations. The fourth premise of GE is the only premise which addresses selection coefficients in a population:   


4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

You badly lost that argument. It's okay. There is absolutely no shame in that. Science rewards being wrong because that's how we arrive at better answers. If you want to claim that the majority of mutations that are fixed in a population are, in fact, deleterious, that's even more of an uphill battle and is easily shown to be false via sequencing data. 

  


&gt;I want you to speak in terms that 1979 Kimura would understand. 1991  Kimura tried to throw Ohta under the bus for some reason, but the field  of population genetics has not gone along with him. 

Again, I invite you to perform the analysis using your own method. Just let me know what you're doing and why. There is no bus, Kimura was using the best available data and he was skeptical about some of Ohta's claims which are clearly laid out in his 1991 paper that we've already discussed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Namely, you have only two categories to pick from: strictly neutral and effectively neutral. 

I don't, because that's not how the data and the real world work. We operate with evidence, not semantic definitions or misunderstandings from the late 60's and 70's.   


&gt;But Kimura in 1979 made no provision at all for 'strictly neutral' mutations. 

So what? 1991 Kimura did. End of story. It doesn't even matter what you call it. The mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism. If you are claiming that they do, then you must show evidence for it. It cannot simply be asserted or quoted.   


&gt; And Eyre-Walker and Keightly similarly make no bones about the fact that all mutations have fitness effects. 

Brother, it doesn't matter what they said or how you are reading it. It only matters that the claim is supported by evidence or not. Keightly is clear:   


“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95%  and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively  neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50%  of mutations are deleterious.**”

  
30% of mutations in coding regions are neutral. 95% to 50% of non-coding are neutral. 1% of the human genome is coding, the other 99% is non-coding. You can do the math there. The vast majority of mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism in any detectable manner. If it's not detectable, you cannot claim that they are deleterious. If you do claim they are deleterious, you need to show the data. Otherwise it's an untested assertion.   


&gt; 58 mutations is a laughably small sample size

Then, using 10 different tools to measure the integrity of the rivet with all of them giving the same independent ""no defect"" consensus and then cross-checking the rivet against several large data bases with known rivet defects and finding that your single rivet doesn't have any of those defects either, you say, ""I think it's good given the available data.""

t1_ff7rbty,t3_er0vih,"&gt;Since we aren't talking about how the alleles propagate in a population, this is a functional definition. All mutations in the above analysis are ""selectively neutral"" according to Kimura:

I want you to speak in terms that 1979 Kimura would understand. 1991 Kimura tried to throw Ohta under the bus for some reason, but the field of population genetics has not gone along with him. Namely, you have only two categories to pick from: strictly neutral and effectively neutral.  


You're playing an obfuscation game by appealing to a very highly specialized and limited methodology and ignoring everything else that utterly contradicts what you're trying to show.  


You want to say that these mutations, since no fitness effect can be detected using this methodology, are 'strictly neutral'. But Kimura in 1979 made no provision at all for 'strictly neutral' mutations. And Eyre-Walker and Keightly similarly make no bones about the fact that all mutations have fitness effects. But they warn that many if not most mutations have effects too subtle to be detected in laboratory settings. You have ignored these warnings and are therefore drastically misinterpreting this data.  


58 mutations is a laughably small sample size, but based upon these results I'd say it fits very well with Kimura's 1979 model, where most mutations are said to be effectively neutral. So that means these are very slightly deleterious mutations.  It's like trying to detect a single particle of rust on a mostly new car from looking at it from 30 feet away.",1579657072

t1_ff7q4ja,t3_es11qk,"Despite what the Journal of Creation insists, there's no evidence that ""variation-inducing genetic elements"" are a thing. That argument is bascially saying that we experience ""pre-selection"" for variation that *might* become functional in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

This idea has problems, but only one of them really matters:

It's entirely self-defeating because it implicitly acknowledges that these regions don't have a function *at present*. That's conceded off the top, and then the argument is ""but they are built to acquire a function in the future"". Okay, and? They're *not functional right now*. So that's the ballgame, as far as I'm concerned. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, the purported mechanism through which these ""VIGEs"" would work to generate more variation? Those would be evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation, recombination, and neofunctionalization. So...yes? Is that the argument creationists want to go with?

&amp;nbsp;

Third, creationist might argue ""well, having the variation is inherently functional"", even if it doesn't do anything *yet*. Which, fine, but there are two knock-on problems from there. First, we know what that looks like. There are species (often microbial parasites) that are adapted to maintain a higher-than-expected level of variation, and we know what the hallmarks are - suppression of DNA repair mechanisms and frequent intra-genomic recombination, to name two hallmarks. And we don't see that universally.

Second, selection isn't forward-looking. It can't preserve stuff that isn't doing something *now*. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally (and related to the last point above), if these regions were ""designed"" for a purpose, then they'd be sequence-constrained, i.e. there'd be selection against mutation accumulation in these regions, to preserve the ""designed"" function. But they do accumulate mutations in the manner we'd expect if they were unconstrained. Meaning there just isn't a function there. 

&amp;nbsp;

So no, I don't by this ""VIGE"" argument for a second. Neither should you.",1579656377

In humans, using natural environments, and evaluating functional consequences of mutations:

Gómez-Romero *et al.*  (2018) identified de novo mutations in the offspring of a trio proband.  58 mutations were found with 35x coverage on the parents and 100x on  the child. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variants (barring  PCR primer difficulties).

[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115)

The variants identified in this study can be found in Table S4: [https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf)

Of  the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects  and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.

/u/nomenmeum is citing [the ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE): for the laymen, ENCODE was a genetic survey of the human genome, using the broadest possible definition of functional, in order to identify previously unknown areas of activity. And, naturally, they found activity:

&gt;The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical RNA and/or chromatin associated event in at least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event: 95% of the genome lies within 8kb of a DNA-protein interaction (as assayed by bound ChIP-seq motifs or DNaseI footprints), and 99% is within 1.7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE.

The problem is that 'one biochemical event' is a very broad term. It doesn't actually imply function: we have broken genes, such as our vitamin C synthesis gene, that are still involved in such an event, and they don't do anything anymore.

Secondly, given they used the broadest possible definition, we *know* that 20% of the genome has *absolutely no function*. That number can't go down any further.

&gt;Selection coefficients are what population genetics models are all about! 

It's a small component of a huge field that rarely anyone is concerned with, especially in the case of disease/pathogenecity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; When you say ""functional definitions at the molecular level"", you're  going outside of population genetics altogether and you're putting out a  massive red herring that has nothing to do with what we're talking  about here.  

I'm not, and these kinds of studies comprise huge proportions of the field. Feel free to check out GWAS. 

  


&gt;None of what we've been quoting from Kimura, Ohta, Eyre-Walker,  Keightley, etc. has had anything to do with ""functional definitions at a  molecular level."" 

YES, that's correct for the most part. You have been quoting operational definitions and claiming that they confer functional relevance when they don't. That's the problem we are having. It doesn't really matter what semantic definition you decide to land on, you just need to show how you determine if a mutation is good, bad, or neutral. That's it.   


&gt;Kimura conveniently neglected to mention this was also HIS model, which he presented in 1979. 

Nearly Neutral Theory is an extension of his model which predicts that some weakly deleterious mutations can reach fixation in small populations when genetic drift is a more powerful driving force than natural selection. When the population is large enough, natural selection becomes the greater driving force again and the allele is removed from the population. This is not synonymous with claiming that, ""the majority of mutations are deleterious"" as you want to do. This is something that you can actually test right now. As before, show the data, not the misquote.    


&gt; In Kimura's own model from '79, which he is here trying to pretend  didn't happen for some reason, these 'very slightly deleterious  mutations' (effectively neutral) were a huge proportion of the overall  total. 

Kimura isn't pretending anything. You just haven't the slightest idea what it predicts or why and so you keep playing a semantic language game with yourself. I don't care what you decide to call a mutation, just show the data.   


&gt; Something else must be going on, but he's not being forthright as to his reasons for changing his story. 

Right. Clearly it's a huge conspiracy to deceive you. It would be totally unreasonable to suggest that you never understand neutral theory to begin with and now it's slowly started to sink in.   


&gt;Certainly modern scientists still view these effectively neutral  mutations as being prevalent, and the fact that they would be is so  obvious as to be beyond question.  

We don't do the Atheist Jesus thing around here. Show the data, not the misquote.

For a more dramatic example mice are about 90% the same when we account for the genes shared by both us and them but the other differences (that matter less for survival) climb all the way to 50%. We also should be careful to not take a linear approach with the differences denoted here because 6 million years for a 1% difference and 65 million years for a 10% difference doesn’t match up on a straight line steady rate of change when we consider yeast and certain plant species that are still around 30% identical to us when considering just the shared genes but they diverged from us over a billion years ago.

Several trillion generations of organisms in the direct ancestor-descendant lineage from “the first living organism” (whatever that entails) to the time period we would give for the origin of of our species.

I worded it that way, because it is important to know that there are two basic laws that deal with evolution. They are called the law of biodiversity and the law of monophyly. Nothing transforms into something else fundamentally different than how it started (especially not in a single generation) but every organism ever born or produced by the reproductive practices of single celled organisms contains mutations so that *automatically* when accounting for these mutations and heredity the allele frequency of the population changes (something learned about when studying heredity in high school). All that this means is that there may be a different variants of the same gene in the same population but it may vary between 0% and 100% of the population containing any particular variant and with each new death or birth this percentage changes - diversity increases with more individuals.

With those two laws in mind and all of the facts like the number of mutations that occur, the sequence of how everything in buried underground, the genetic evidence and so forth we can reconstruct our phylogeny to give us a good picture of the process.

There are also other things I could share regarding paleontology, genetics, and experimental data such as when several different single celled organism evolved multicellularity and basic cell differentiation (very basic) in a lab setting because many single celled organisms have the genes needed to move to multicellularity already and some of them regularly form colonies and it just takes the same thing but a more dedicated form to get to the major clades in the video series. I also talked to the creator of this video series recently so that if you do happen to watch it in your free time, and you get to episode 46 before episode 47 is released, he informed me that he decided to split up episode 47 into four different videos because of the vast amount of information just from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens (which is obviously towards the end of explaining how single celled organisms have rise to humans)

A more simple explanation, but without all the necessary details to fully explain the process, is that evolution is population based and those allele frequency changes I mentioned earlier because of mutation, heredity, and selection pressures (as well as other things like genetic drift) provides the increasing biodiversity *within* a breeding population like humans with different color skin, different color eyes, hair color, height, connected or disconnected ear lobes. Obviously, most of these changes don’t really provide much benefit or disability when it comes to survival and reproduction and often times a beneficial one won’t be very dramatic all at once though we have several examples of those too. The detrimental ones do slip in, but generally those tend to result in a shorter lifespan or infertility and some like sickle cell anemia also provide a benefit alongside the detrimental effect. Some like that and diabetes won’t stop new organisms from being born so they spread just like all the beneficial ones. What really matters is the general trend in a local population to acquire some trait (good or bad - with many “bad” ones resulting in death and infertility and not getting passed on). All that needs to happen from there is some reason for the population to split up into different smaller breeding populations more isolated from the whole group. At first the biggest difference might be nothing more than what we see across the entire population of living humans or they can be as dramatic as the difference between broccoli and kale. If the very same processes continue over time (everything related to evolution of a single population plus the genetic isolation between two sub-populations) the differences between these groups pile up. At first, when considering single celled organisms, many of the most noticeable differences have to deal with the working of the cell like the type of cell membrane, the type of protein used for synthesizing ATP, and sometimes, especially in our case, the acquisition of endosymbiotic bacteria that later become organelles. At this stage of evolution there is also a lot of horizontal gene transfer so that different species have a mechanism for sharing genetics making it a bit more difficult to work out the phylogenetic relationships (the parent-daughter relationships). After this results in eukaryotes and eukaryotes branch into many different sub-groups multicellularity occurred at least a handful of times within plants, what would become animals, fungi, slime molds and so forth. At this stage the effects of horizontal gene transfer have less effect and before this time sexual reproduction starts to play a bigger role (along with heredity and sexual selection). Several small changes and the same process continues to drive biodiversity but as time goes on certain populations acquire certain defining characteristics across the board and the rest of the group does off. Without dragging this on all day this results in the rest of the changes resulting in an internal body cavity filled with organs, bilateral symmetry and a brain, cartilage and bone, nerves, muscles, eyes and all of the other complex characteristics found in humans and whole groups of animals related to us. Some fish eventually took to the land and developed the trait of having four limbs (legs, arms, wings, whatever but always four or less as sometimes a loss of limbs defines a group). They get better at living on land, they develop mammal characteristics, they develop to living in trees, they start walking on the ground and using tools and they gradually become human. All the while the branching tree of life is continuing on so that side branches (like distant cousins) split off to eventually give way to other living things and several extinct ones. The entire time nothing is ever fundamentally different from the generation before or after it, but as a population eventually becomes more isolated and the in between forms die off we get those defining characteristics for every taxonomic clade with several found that seem to fit into two of them at the same time showing a clear transition from one to the other (just in case they were pictured as sister groups and not parent and daughter groups). This long paragraph is still just a very basic summary of how evolution gives rise to all of the biodiversity around us though some are quick to point out hybrids and nearly extinct populations showing little diversity which both happen as well and are completely consistent with evolution when you know all the details just like converging on the same traits *after* diverging into separate breeding populations because both groups still happen to live in a similar environment or are able to exploit a similar niche in a different one isn’t in any way contradictory to evolution.",1579647079

The fundamental principle is that no organism ever stops being what its ancestors were.  This means that humans are still apes, which are still monkeys, which are still primates, which are still mammals, etc.  So no, there's never been a case where an organism's offspring is something that is not in the same clade as the parent.  That's the whole point:  no organism will ever cease to be an ancestor to its descendants, and no organism will ever cease to be a descendant of its ancestors -- nothing in genetics would make sense any other way.  Even if some future organism goes on to form its own clade, it is still a member of all the same clades that its ancestors were.

What we *do* observe, repeatably in every life sciences field, is that offspring are generally *slightly different* than their parent(s).  The offspring of an aphid is still an aphid, and it's still all the things its parents were -- but it's not the same as either of its parents.  Nor are you and I exactly the same as our parents.  This is due to mutation, as well as sexual reproduction -- but it still happens in asexual organisms like bacteria, etc. (including aphids, which can reproduce parthenogenetically).

These changes add up over huge amounts of time (read:  many MANY generations), so that after all that time the organisms may (or may not) be a different species from their ancestors.  Modern dogs are descended from gray wolves -- and they are still gray wolves.  Modern humans and chimps are descended from some common ancestor in the clade Hominine -- and both humans and chimps are still Hominines.

t3_es11qk,t3_es11qk,"&gt;If most small, deleterious mutations cannot be selected against, and build up in the genome, what real-world, tested mechanism can evolution call upon to stop mutational meltdown?

If they are deleterious, they can be selected against -- maybe not within one generation, but within enough degradations, it will have a selectable gap to the 'original' variants in the population. Statistically, because the genome is large enough compared to the mutation rate such that most genes will not change, even across large swaths of time, it is unlikely for an unselectable gene to fix at all and thus degrade the collective genome: the original variants are likely to still exist in the population, and they become the selected variant after enough degradation occurs.

Second, we're not sure what this would look like. It's not clear if genes can be rated so linearly such that such a point actually exists. It's also unclear whether or not unselectable beneficials -- or the mutations reversing this entropy -- eventually become dominant or bring this to an equilibrium above extinction.

Otherwise, we expect that beneficial variants will arise at a greater pace than neutral degradation could occur. Even if they are only minorly better, they will overcome neutral or extinction.

&gt;What do you have to say about Sanford’s testing on the H1N1 virus, which he claims proves genetic entropy?

He relabeled the axis for 'mortality' as 'fitness'. There are many reasons to believe that these aren't the same thing, as viruses attenuate to their hosts: they don't want to kill the host, they want to use them to spread. Mortality is not fitness, particularly as ultra-mortality, or what Sanford would argue is 'peak fitness', results in rapid extinction.

Furthermore, given we were combating an breakout, those numbers are going to be biased by our response. Mortality would drop off as the epidemic ends, and this has nothing to do with the fitness of the virus itself, but the lack of new hosts.

&gt;What about his claim that most population geneticists believe the human genome is degrading by as much as 1 percent per generation?

I don't believe these claims are backed with any serious effort. I highly doubt 'most' accept 1% as degradation, if they see any degradation at all. I have yet to see any efforts made to cite this claim.

&gt;If genetic entropy was proven, would this create an unsolvable problem for common ancestry and large-scale evolution?

No/maybe. This largely depends on where it is proven and the actual mechanisms.

Humans have recreated the world into a strange place, biologically speaking, and we have largely uncoupled the systems that have brought us here. We might be causing genetic entropy in other species through hyper-predation; we might be suffering genetic entropy because we live in a largely post-selection society. However, if this isn't innate to the algorithm, then nothing is wrong with our deep time analysis. Since it doesn't appear to operate in viruses or bacteria, we seem to be okay.

Otherwise, it may only predict the lifetime of one species. It doesn't account for speciation.",1579642617

Yes, we can say that there are different ""kinds"" of organisms; for example, some animals can't reproduce with other animals of different species. (This positively is not true for all animals, let alone all organisms, but it's a simple categorical framework we can use.)

So, fine. Cats and dogs are different ""kinds,"" but they themselves are large categories: wolves, cheetahs, ocelots, domesticated dogs, housecats, etc. So are cats and fish. Fish includes a phylogenetic lineage that comprises all mammals, all reptiles (and birds), etc. 

We can then ask: how are cats and dogs similar? Well, they both have fur, they both give birth to live young, they both have mammary glands, etc. Some very specific things. Then you can apply this to the category from earlier. How are fish and cats similar? Well, they both have eyes, they both have pharyngeal gill slits (ontogenetically, at least), they both have post-anal tails, etc. Less specific things.

Key point to remember: this has ALWAYS been the case.

&amp;#x200B;

2) it's balls. He equates 'kills humans' with viral fitness (this is not correct), and he doesn't even measure that correctly anyway.

3) It's balls. Selective pressure against humans is certainly lower in the western world (if you have eight kids, chances are all eight will survive. In the past you might need to have eight to successfully raise two). But all that means is there's greater scope for variation. Depending on how you measure fitness, you could argue that ""mean"" fitness is reducing, but only because you've lowered the lower extent. The upper extent is still *there.* To put it very crudely, helping more 3s and 4s survive does not make the 10s stop existing, but it might lower the *average score*.

4) It depends on how it was proven. Given all organisms accrue mutations at different rates (many *markedly* faster than humans) the implication is very strongly that if it exists, it is incredibly slow. If it is slower than actual *speciation*, it is meaningless. A species cannot degrade due to genetic entropy if that species has already become multiple other species.",1579641546

&gt; We dont see rodents give birth to anything other than rodents 

Correct. We also don't see mammals give birth to anything other than mammals. Nor do we see vertebrates give birth to anything other than vertebrates.

Nested hierarchies all the way down, and you cannot ever change your ancestry. 

Humans are apes, and mammals, and tetrapods, and vertebrates, and metazoa, and eukaryotes, and they always will be.

The prototypical creationist saw of ""we don't see dogs giving birth to cats"" or ""we don't see any animals giving birth to new kinds of animals"" misses the point spectacularly.  Evolutionary theory *never* posits this should be the case, and dogs giving birth to cats would in fact falsify common ancestry completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Both dogs and cats are carnivores: they share many traits (both genetic and phenotypic) which other clades do not possess (for example, cows are *not* carnivores, though cows, cats and dogs are all mammals). 

At some point in the past a carnivorous species that was neither cat nor dog (because those did not exist) but that was unarguably a carnivore (something like Miacis  [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacis) ) diverged into separate lineages, and those lineages became reproductively isolated (perhaps they migrated apart, or were separated by geographic changes). No longer mixing genes between the two populations, those populations were free to diverge further, and adapt to niches they now occupied. One lineage became cursorial predators, retaining all the carnivore features but specialising in running prey down (a tactic that also favoured large social groups: pack hunting). The other became ambush predators, retaining all the carnivore features but specialising in leaping down onto unsuspecting prey (a tactic that absolutely does not favour large social groups: you can't hide a pack of animals in a tree).

The former lineage were ancestral dogs, the latter ancestral cats. 

Cursorial predation (dogs) favours long legs with stiffer elbow joints and blunter claws (you're running, not pouncing) and consequently longer jaws (you bring down prey by grabbing on with your mouth).

Ambush predation (cats) favours shorter, more muscular limbs with more mobile elbows and sharper claws (you're pouncing and grabbing on with your arms), and shorter, wider jaws (you're already grabbing with your arms, so your mouth delivers the kill-stroke)

We see these morphological differences very clearly today, and yet, both groups still retain the same, shared carnivorian features of their ancestry: one ancestral lineage has diverged into two distinct lineages. At no point did dogs give birth to cats or vice versa, and at no point was this required.

(for a really neat example of evolutionary plasticity, see hyenas: these are unarguably in the cat lineage, not the dog lineage, yet they have evolved to fill a cursorial predation niche, and consequently have acquired the same sort of phenotypic traits: they have stiffer elbows, blunter claws, longer jaws and are pack animals. Cats cannot give birth to dogs, but cats *can* evolve to a state that is remarkably dog-like).

&amp;#x200B;

Thus: one group of ancestral unicellular life evolved multicellularity (possibly to escape predation: we know this can happen, as we have observed it in the lab). This was successful, and simple multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. Cell specialisations emerged (cells on the periphery might have become more flexible, while cells in the centre might have become more metabolically active), all in response to positional cues (i.e. the same cell could be either, depending on position: same organism, not a mix of two). Multicellular organisms became more complex.

Some folded, allowing greater morphological specialisations. In some cases this was really successful, so folded multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. 

Some of these folded multicellular organisms folded completely to provide a central tube. This created a core around which to build further morphological advances, so was successful. Tubed multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. 

As time passes, the tube becomes a central nervous system (in some lineages), and in some descendants of those lineages, becomes a spine, and in some descendants of those lineages, becomes the spine of a jawed aquatic animal (ancestral fish). Some descendants of those primitive fish take to the land (ancestral tetrapods), and so on and so forth.

Stepwise, with every single step being a perfectly viable organism, analogues of which we can observe even today.

Final note: your paper concerns 6 mutations ""per essential part of the genome"". Very little of the human genome is essential, and most mutations are in non-coding sequence.

How about a mutation of our mandible that would have weakened our jaw (compared to that of other primates) but increased the size of our cranium, allowing for a larger prefrontal cortex.

Our weakened bite encouraged us to cook our meat making it easier to digest, thus providing the energy required for powering bigger brains and triggering a feed-back loop from which human consciousness, as if on a dimmer-switch, emerged over time.

&gt;You are attempting to appropriate mutational definitions which rely on selection coefficients and population size to claim that it is synonymous with functional definitions at the molecular level.  

Selection coefficients are what population genetics models are all about! It's about measuring fitness and measuring (or inferring) the fitness effects of mutations through MA experiments. When you say ""functional definitions at the molecular level"", you're going outside of population genetics altogether and you're putting out a massive red herring that has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. None of what we've been quoting from Kimura, Ohta, Eyre-Walker, Keightley, etc. has had anything to do with ""functional definitions at a molecular level."" And I think you know that, deep, deep down. Or have you managed to confuse yourself in  your attempt to confuse others?  


Let's address what you quoted from Kimura in '91:  


&gt; ""If, as Ohta (1974, 1976) proposed, the majority of ""neutral mutations"" are, in reality, very slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral, the evolutionary rate is higher in smaller populations than in larger populations.   


Kimura conveniently neglected to mention this was also HIS model, which he presented in 1979. What a stunning omission! As if he was trying to pretend he did not also promote this very model...  


&gt;  **Whether such very slightly deleterious mutations are really prevalent in nature or not, I think, remains to be investigated for many genes in various organisms.**""   


In Kimura's own model from '79, which he is here trying to pretend didn't happen for some reason, these 'very slightly deleterious mutations' (effectively neutral) were a huge proportion of the overall total. And none were 'selectively neutral'. All had fitness effects. This is the same view held by modern population geneticists as well, such as Eyre-Walker and Keightley. They have stood by Ohta's model. Kimura is trying to beat around the bush by saying it ""remains to be investigated"", but that wasn't his story in '79. Something else must be going on, but he's not being forthright as to his reasons for changing his story. Certainly modern scientists still view these effectively neutral mutations as being prevalent, and the fact that they would be is so obvious as to be beyond question. Most mutations are extremely small.   


**""Mutagenesis and mutation accumulation experiments can give us detailed information about the DFE \[distribution of fitness effects\] of mutations only if they have a moderately large effect, as these are the mutations that have detectable effects in laboratory assays. However, it seems likely that many and possibly the majority of mutations have effects that are too small to be detected in the laboratory.""**  


**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

t1_ff5gtif,t3_emxcfo,"&gt; It has to happen somewhere more then elsewhere.

And when the difference is one is orders of magnitudes larger than everything else, it isn't chance causing it. And when the rest of the genes of the other populations are just variations of some of the more diverse population's variations, there is no room to doubt the more diverse population being the original. And when the fossil record says the exact same thing, it is pretty much overkill.

&gt;Indeed one finds very black, curly hair etc etc body details in people in South india and down through Malaysia.Yet totally unrelated to black Africans. its very possib;e there was slightly more need for changes in hot, humid, africa back in the day.

That isn't really relevant. The question is not sharing a few traits, which due to the environment would likely not have been lost in the first place, but overall diversity of both phenotypes and genotypes as well as the pattern as mentioned above. Those populations are also not as far removed from Africa as you seem to think and they are.

As for the rest, various studies have shown over and over again that all changes to body plans are determined by genetics which are changed only by mutation. Every single aspect of it, from how mutations arise, to how they change the genetic code, to how this alters the resulting protein, to how the altered protein alters the bodyplan has been rigorously tested again and again. There is frankly no room for a different mechanism to change body plans besides mutation.

And that is many creationists don't deny that. Because the evidence is ridiculously conclusive on that. But you

You are attempting to appropriate mutational definitions which rely on selection coefficients and population size to claim that it is synonymous with functional definitions at the molecular level. This is patently false and I even showed you why mathematically. Here it is AGAIN for the fucking fourth time, you dishonest prick. Feel free to ignore it, AGAIN, and look like an idiot, AGAIN:  


 ""If a deleterious mutation with *s* = −0.001 occurs in a population of *N* = 106, |*s*| is much greater than 1/(2*N*) = 5 × 3 10−7. The fitness of mutant homozygotes will be lower than that of wild-type homozygotes only by 0.002. This fitness difference is easily swamped by the large random variation in the number of offspring among different individuals, by which *s* is defined. By contrast, in the case of brother-sister mating *N* = 2, so that even a semi-lethal mutation with *s* = −0.25 will be called neutral. If this mutation is fixed in the population, the mutant homozygote has a fitness of 0.5 compared with the nonmutant homozygote. A fitness decrease of half is removed from the population by natural selection.""  
 

Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **22**, 2318–42 (2005).  


A selection coefficient is NOT a functional determinant of the mutation and CANNOT be used in that way. The selection coefficient definition of mutation is operationally dependent on the effective population size AS SHOWN ABOVE. It is NOT synonymous with what's happening at the molecular level. You seem unable to differentiate between the two in our conversations even Kimura is quite explicit about which definitions he is using even if your reading comprehension fails you.   


&gt; Quote Kimura's own words, and cite the source. 

You clearly still haven't read Kimura's 1991 work. It's barely 20 pages, it will take you 10 minutes, if that:   


""If, as Ohta (197 4, 1976) proposed, the majority of ""neutral mutations"" are, in reality, very slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral, the evolutionary rate is higher in smaller populations than in larger populations. This is because a very slightly deleterious mutant behaves as if selectively neutral when Nes' is much smaller than unity, where s' (&gt;O) is the selection coefficient against the mutant, and Ne is the effective population size, while it may be effectively selected against if Nes' is larger than unity. Recently, Ohta and Tachida (1990) applied the concept of ""near neutrality"" to explain the puzzling observation regarding nucleotide versus allozyme heterozygosities in D.similans, on which I have mentioned in one of the above sections. These authors assume that mutations causing protein polymorphisms are subject to stronger selection on the average (such as Nes'=0.5) compared with mutants that involve in DNA polymorphisms (such as Nes'=O.l), even if the absolute sizes of the selection coefficient (denoted by s') are very small in the ordinary sense. Taking into account the fact that D. similans has a much larger panmictic population than D. melanogaster which has the subdivided population structure, these authors claim that the contrasting pattern of polymorphisms in these two species can be understood by assuming nearly neutral mutations. **Whether such very slightly deleterious mutations are really prevalent in nature or not, I think, remains to be investigated for many genes in various organisms.**""

&amp;#x200B;

One more: Certainly a [new biochemical function without losing the old function](https://jvi.asm.org/content/85/2/932.long) counts.

t1_ff6dw49,t3_er0vih,"It's not merely unclear, it's dead wrong. And I've explained it countless times, quoting directly from the literature.

t1_ff6a3oo,t3_er0vih,"&gt;In what way is a functionally neutral mutation impacting fitness

Lol! Good job, you just spawned yet another hazy and confusing term that is not found in the literature itself. Why can't you manage to stick to the real terminology, if you're so educated in this?? It's astonishing.  


&gt; Show the data, not the misquote. 

I haven't misquoted anything. You apparently are incapable of grasping that with Kimura's (really, Ohta's) model, ALL mutations have fitness effects. It is this model that is still being used by Eyre-Walker, Keightley, etc. It's the consensus view in population genetics. It's a spectrum of fitness effects that never actually touches 0. This is a function of the fact that ALL mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small (to quote directly from Eyre-Walker and Keightley). But not all effects are large enough to be selectable. Thus the term 'effectively neutral'. This window of no selection is being defined in terms of population size.  


&gt;Again, demonstrate your position by analyzing real mutations and showing that functionally neutral mutations have small fitness effects. You have exactly zero qualifications and no educational background to make this statement and you are telling someone who works in this field that they are wrong about a semantic definition.      


You're using your own made-up terminology yet you claim to work in the field. That's curious. I don't need to 'demonstrate my position', since the position I'm talking about here is what the mainstream scientists in the field of population genetics ALREADY GRANT IS THE CASE. It's odd that you cannot tell from reading their papers.  


&gt;It sounds ""sciency"" *because it is science*. We aren't running around on Reddit creating safe spaces and insular echo chambers like a bunch of snowflakes afraid to be wrong about something.

t1_ff67r77,t3_er0vih,"&gt;You quoted from Kimura without citing the source, likely from some of his later work from after he abandoned near neutral theory and began obfuscating with different terms...

There is a full list of references in my post that you are invited to read through. Kimura refers to functionally and operationally neutral/deleterious mutations in all of his works. If you are still having trouble understanding which definition he is using at any given time, you can ask yourself ""Does this definition depend on the size of the population?"" If it does, then it's an operational definition. If it does not, then it is likely a functional definition.",1579623169
t1_ff67r77,t3_er0vih,"&gt; Then you'll have no problem understanding that effectively neutral  mutations do have a small fitness impact that accumulates over time,  right? 

In what way is a functionally neutral mutation impacting fitness and how are you measuring that quantatively? I've asked you this several times now and you respond with quotes from Kimura or Keightly. Show the data, not the misquote.  


&gt;  These 'arguments' amount to nothing more to equivocating and quote-mining  on the definition of neutral to make it seem like neutral mutations  have no effect on the genome.  

Again, demonstrate your position by analyzing real mutations and showing that functionally neutral mutations have small fitness effects. If you cannot measure the fitness effect and if no fitness effect is observed from the mutation, then it cannot be deleterious. You run back to misquoting Kimura and Keightly over and over. Just show the data, not the misquote.

&gt; But that's not what population geneticists actually mean by the term.

I am using mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome as examples because those are specifically* non-recombinant*, your criticism here does not apply, each starting original one of those gene sequences could only have one initial collection of alleles and phenotypes. To get to the modern number from that requires mutations from the starting sequences.

You’re the one who keeps saying that “they don’t debate links” so please don’t use previous threads as backing for a point when I am referring to.

You do realize that creationists themselves keep asking courts to rule on whether creationism is science, right?  In the last trial they were convinced they had it in the bag because the judge was a Republican.  They still lost.

And funny that if you actually ask practically any scientist in the world they will tell you evolution is science and creationism isn't.  Even *ID scientists*, the handful there are, admit this much.

&gt; Biblical creationism is based on a conclusion of gods word establishing boundarys on certain subjects touching on origins. Organized creationism dfends these, attacks opposition ideas, and hypothesis about anything on origins.

It is very telling what they don't do: test their ideas with evidence.  This is the opposite of science.

That's wonderful, so why do creationists like you and /u/DavidTMarks keep referring to these specific parts that you have problems with as ""evolution""? Do you complain about the pollution of Hummers by complaining about ""vehicles""?

&gt; You know this but don't admit it.

Should we just assume what you mean instead of you guys SAYING what you mean? Why is it our burden to understand you when you admit that you have troubles expressing yourselves properly?

&gt; I have no problem with the trivial parts of evolution (mutations being transmitted to subsequent generations, ...), I only have a problem with the part of evolution that corresponds to what the general public understands the meaning of evolution to be...

Ah, so it's everyone else's fault that they seem to fit your beliefs about evolution? Stop blaming everyone except yourself for your failure to say what you meant to say.

&gt; ...to the part of evolution that all people who have trouble swallowing the evolution story refer to.

You mean people ignorant of evolution or dishonest people. Why should you want to be hitch your wagon to those people when discussing evolution?

&gt; You don't want any terminology to be used to specify this part of evolution: you continually reject terms such as macro-evolution.

Because ""macro-evolution"" just means evolution above the species level. There's no different between it and ""micro-evolution"" except for time. Creationists like you keep using the term to argue that they're two different mechanisms, but they're not.

&gt; So the term evolution has been broadened so much as to be essentially meaningless when we try and discuss anything.

Use the correct terms and there won't be a problem. When people show you that you're using terms wrong or getting the science wrong, stop using those same wrong contexts or arguments.

&gt; You're trying to say something about one part and we are obviously talking about another part.

If it were obvious, we'd know. But you misusing a term doesn't mean it's obvious to anyone except yourself. And if you knew what you meant, why didn't you say it in the first place?

The problem is 100% yours, 0% ours.

&gt; It's pretty much as if there's a theory that predicts that the sun will rise every morning and also predicts that pigs can fly. When we can confirm the prediction that the sun rises in the morning, you say ""There! The theory's proven -- including the part that pigs can fly because it's all part of the same theory"".

Except theories in science never get proven. They can make predictions, such as ""the sun will rise tomorrow at X time,"" but that doesn't mean that the same predictive ability of this theory will be 100% correct all the time. Theories update with new information. Therefore, no theory can ever be proven, just validated or falsified.

&gt; This is patent imbecilic nonsense and a complete waste of time and energy.

Agreed, so why do creationists continue to deny the reality of evolution, constantly misuse terms, keep making well-debunked arguments and think that they, non-experts in the science, know more than the experts in the science?

You're right for the wrong reasons.

&gt; Conclusions
&gt; it's worthless trying to debate anything here. The obfuscation based on terminology never ends. There seems to be a deliberate intention to misunderstand.

Again, use the correct terms in the correct context and there's no problem with this. It's your fault that you keep failing at this, not ours.

&gt; however, one can sometimes learn interesting things inadvertently from papers and references mentioned.

And you can read the journals without being prompted. Too bad creationists tend to read just creationist sources and not scientific ones.

&gt; I think that you should also consider the nature of being human. I assume in good faith, that you (or some of you) are reasonable, intelligent people who have a good understanding of science.

We're not creationists, so there's a good chance that your statement is true.

&gt; I know that this describes me.

Not in a million years. You've been wrong so often that it's questionable whether you have a real M.Sc. But that's just how I feel; you still get much of evolutionary biology wrong.

&gt; And yet here we are with diametrically opposed understandings of a particular issue.

Yet one side is objectively right and creationists are objectively wrong. Weird, huh?

&gt; What does this tell us? It says that there is something about the human mind that is prone to very strong conclusions and biases, to rationalisations and justifications.

We know. Religious beliefs lead people to ignore the reality which contradicts these beliefs. That's why creationists are just as much deniers of science as flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, etc.

&gt; This happens in all areas of life. It seems to be absolutely impossible for me to get you to see things the way that I see them (and probably vice versa).

Incorrect. We can comprehend what you're arguing, and then we explain why your arguments are wrong. Seeing what your side is is not the same as agreeing that your side is correct.

&gt; I am so convinced that the way that I see things is correct (in this area, not in all areas) - and you haven't got a hope of changing it, until perhapsI really feel convinced that you understand my point of view and can see things my way. I think that this is true of almost everyone.

That's called being close-minded. That makes you most likely wrong. Probably 90+% of the regulars here on /r/debateevolution would change our minds when given sufficient evidence that what we know is wrong. I would. Problem is, creationists can't provide a single shred of evidence for creationism, and often try to argue against evolution using bad logic or outright lies.

So if you want things to change, you have to change. We're the ones open-minded and able to understand other views. You just don't want to give up your beliefs, no matter how often they're shown to be wrong.",1579579041
t1_ff4xus3,t3_eqcv4q,"&gt; we are talking about a specific part of evolution that we have a problem with.

Okay, but you can't just say ""the word evolution only applies to this stuff we disagree on"". 

&gt;You don't want any terminology to be used to specify this part of evolution: you continually reject terms such as macro-evolution.

*Because it is not a term biologists use the way you want to use it!*

Do you not see the problem here? You're introducing terms, e.g. ""macroevolution"" and ""devolution"" into a scientific debate *that are not used by the field in question* (at least not the way you're using them). You can't just make up words, or have your own special definitions. 

This is why I constantly ask things like ""what's the mechanism that prevents outcome X from happening?"" or ""what specifically counts as 'macroevolution'?"" or ""how do you quantify information?"". If we focus on the traits and processes, rather than the terms, we can actually have a discussion. Getting continually hung up on the terms is a waste of time. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You're trying to say something about one part and we are obviously talking about another part.

I don't think this is the case, but I can't know because *I don't know how you're defining the words you're using.* What's macroevolution, *to you*? Does a new endosymbiotic organelle count? Does a new ""irreducible"" biochemical trait count? Does a virus evolving from a plasmid count? I have no idea! And I've [literally been asking for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/70iux9/for_real_define_macroevolution/). 

If you, or any creationist, could provide a consistent definition for ""macroevolution"", we could actually talk about whether or not that happens. But all I ever get are excuses.",1579576940
t1_fewfvuu,t3_eqcv4q,"&gt; Yes, a major problem is the stubborn refusal to simply use the correct definitions for words like ""evolution"" and ""fitness"". I totally agree.

and from /u/jattok: 

&gt;That's not a type of evolution. That's evolution. Period. It's creationists who keep trying to say that there are more than one type of evolution.

t1_ff4nxwr,t3_erb8od,"You’d think that there’d be something in place to reverse the unconstitutional laws that are allowed to persist anyway such as requiring a religious belief to hold political office or the promotion by the government to insert religious ideas into the pledge of allegiance or on our currency or the displaying of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse. Even when such provisions exist to stop these laws, ordinances, and statutes from being enforced they continue to persist anyway. A government official who knowingly allows this type of behavior or is responsible for it is in direct violation of the primary document upon which our laws are based upon, which should be a felony even if it isn’t. However because of fairness laws a simple repeal of unconstitutional laws and the removal from office should be the minimum punishment for these actions and they don’t even get a slap on the wrist but commit some other felony and not only do you spend time in prison but you are banned from employment in fields related to your crimes. Why this doesn’t happen for government officials who knowingly break the law, or the document upon which our laws are meant to be based around, and are allowed to continue holding office is beyond me but use your political position for profit that doesn’t effect the general person nearly as much or violate our humans rights provided by this document and get removed from office and have potential criminal persecution. Something similar nearly happened with Donald Trump over a telephone call if I’m not mistaken but when it comes to the majority of congress and the Vice President wanting to teach creationism in the science class room and they continue holding office despite the obvious violation. 

I wouldn’t know what to call this crime but the principal of the matter is that our country is founded on the Declaration of Independence and the constitutional amendments, especially the first ten of them and when these are deliberately overlooked and violated by top government official the violation becomes law despite the regulations in place that are supposed to prevent this from happening and when they commit a smaller crime in that isn’t mentioned in our founding documents they risk losing their jobs, ability to hold office in the future, and possibly imprisonment based on how blatantly or purposely they broke the law and how breaking the law is supposed to violate national security or provide an unfair benefit because of their government office.",1579573271
t3_ercz37,t3_ercz37,"If we were not ""Created"" by something then none of us would exist. 

The real question is: ""How does our Creator work?""

To recap what I have on that topic:

Earliest stage molecular scale designs did not require complex metabolism to power muscle cells and such, which came later so that essentially plant and animal cells could better eat each other.

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05098-w

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

We can just compare the genes of these living organisms to know how much change is necessary and calculate the amount of time necessary for this change to occur naturally via the same process by which you used previously for calculating the time of divergence for the ancestor of living dogs, wolves, and foxes and again for living humans without considering how this very same molecular dating process is also used for calculating the origins of more inclusive clades like monkeys, euarchontaglires, placental mammals, or opisthokonts and all the way up to the origin of eukaryotes and the the first life forms before that. When all of the evidence is accounted for it clearly favors the scientific consensus which wouldn’t be a problem unless you held a contradictory dogmatic assumption. I go where the evidence leads and not where I wish it would instead. And that is precisely why I’m not a young Earth creationist. None of the fallacies you like to accuse me of apply here.

t1_ff2ylcu,t3_ercz37,"Yes natural selection tends to result in fewer available genes to be passed on but this only makes sense if there are mutations that arise that are selected out by this process naturally in the environment. Artificial selection is similar but not identical as humans are the selective pressure selecting out what they want from the end product instead of what would inevitably result by natural selection in the environment. For instance, if left to their own devices domesticated dogs would still be wolves as this provides a better survival benefit in the wild than an animal that requires human involvement for survival but even then we still get biodiversity because of processes that introduce variety that can be selected for. If there was no variety there would be nothing to act upon and we’d either have no effect from natural selection or complete groups going extinct by environmental pressures that none of them can survive. This obviously doesn’t happen with either of these processes so it would be important to include the whole picture if you’re going to argue against just one piece of the puzzle - the part that removed deleterious or undesirable genes from the population in favor of the more beneficial or desirable ones that accumulate over time in both cases.",1579563519
t3_ercz37,t3_ercz37,"So evolution by natural selection demands a designer because you either don’t know the facts or you choose to lie about them?

The very same process is the only process that explains biodiversity as you explained that reproduction and natural selection play some of the vital roles in evolution though you forgot to mentioned the **measured** mutation rates like those make calculating the time since the MRCA of any clade like you provided for the species Homo sapiens or the entire clade of Canids (dogs). 

Just admitting that felines and panthers are related further complicates your position of separate ancestry as this is a clear example of biodiversity at work. One major noticeable difference is that felines purr and meow while the panthers roar instead. House cats are not the only felines when we can include cheetahs and bobcats and similar cats but panthers include lions and tigers. Move up a couple clades and the ancestor of cats, weasels, dogs, foxes, bears, skunks, hyenas, raccoons and wolverines and several other “kinds” of life was the same animal. Go up a few more clades and now horses, rhinos, hippos, whales, bats, and others join the group. All of these originally originated from something resembling a shrew while on our side of the split the tree shrew is a very similar animal and the elephant shrew from atlantogenata. All of these groups evidentially began looking like a shrew and look at all the diversity since. A loss of biodiversity would suggest that everything either went extinct or interbred so that we got a hybrid of everything instead of the actual branching hierarchy we observe in nature. Successive, usually superficial changes compiled on top of fundamental similarities drives biodiversity and when the population divides so that these changes occur in each group but not the same changes across the entire group it results in the growing trend towards speciation driving the emergence of every one of the clades of our evolutionary phylogeny. The same process by which all cats emerged from the same species (and not just two animals riding on a boat) is the same process by which all carnivores (the clade containing cats, dogs, bears, and pangolins) diverged from a common ancestor and when we go back further in time of up a few clade levels continental drift isolated a few different sub populations of shrew shaped mammal so that we get Laurasiatheria, Atlantogenata, and Euarchontoglires emerging from shrews and considering the armadillo is just a heavily armored version of the same thing the same thing applies to Xenarthra or the armadillos, aardvarks, and sloths. We even have something even older than than this split called juramaia which takes us a lot closer to the split between Eutherians and Metatherians and if including all of these mammals doesn’t provide enough biodiversity from a common ancestor I don’t know what will as the only remaining living mammals are three species that still lay eggs like the common ancestor of all mammals evidently did as well before our group first lost the shell, then developed a placenta to replace the depleting yolk sac, and then subsequently lost the epipubic bones before the males in hominae slowly lost the penis bone as well. There are many more obvious changes that occurred along the way but as this is a continuously branching tree of life with a lot of extinct things along the way despite the continuous increase in diversity among the survivors there isn’t enough time or space to discuss all of them in a single response.

Devolving doesn’t even make sense for someone aware that evolution isn’t driven by a teleological goal. It happens in all possible directions with “possible” being a key word here and natural selection killing off different lineages so that the inevitable result is a diverse array of different populations fit for their environment and their reproductive success and fewer and fewer that acquire deadly mutations or mutations that result in infertility for obvious reasons. If you need it explained, it is as simple as evolution requiring reproduction that can’t happen with sterile and dead organisms so that deliterious mutations are less likely to be passed on than beneficial ones regardless of their rate of occurrence at the beginning due to essentially random mutation.",1579562759

t1_ff4cchk,t3_er3f0m,"&gt;Just curious - where did ICR ‘disown’ the RATE project? 

They didn't disown the RATE project: they disowned the C14 in coal argument. 

The simple answer is that when you send a sample to a lab, they give you the results with no interpretation, because they don't know what you're looking for. 95,000 years is the result you'd expect for a calibration sample looking for machine error -- and you might ask a third party to run a sample like this if you were concerned that your AMS isn't working properly anymore.

Otherwise, the RATE project did admit there were two problems they couldn't solve for: radiometric heat and radiometric dating. It wasn't exactly a raging success.

&gt;And what exactly does evolution suggest about vestigial organs?

/r/creation chirps on how evolution claims vestigial organs have no function. That's not actually what has ever been suggested.

Vestigial simply means it doesn't do what it used to do in another organism; the appendix doesn't produce enzymes for breaking down cellulose anymore, which makes it vestigial. But we never suggested it would be functionless -- this is just another definition taken to an extreme.

It is also a lazy one.",1579561404

There are theistic evolutionists who believe that the entire process is a guided one such that intelligent design arguments slip in from time to time for how a god was necessary for something and there are those that believe in a supernatural creation event followed by a purely naturalistic and unguided process made possible because of this god. The less involved gods are less “theistic” and more “deistic” in that they did something so that we would have something rather than nothing or they were responsible for the so-called mystery at the bottom of physics and why the different constants have particular values. The deist god still relies heavily on fallacious reasoning but at least such ideas allow for physics to take over from there without any supernatural intervention so that once the universe exists the rest of their views are nearly the same as an atheistic and nihilistic physicalist. And the even less “god-like” gods are ancient aliens, computer simulation designers, or pantheist gods where the universe itself is god. These ideas don’t really qualify as biblical creationists but two of them are heavily flawed for other reasons and the last is pointless in that they are basically atheists who refuse to admit it. 

A deist or a pantheist tend to have the least fallacious science denying beliefs of the bunch with young Earth creationists and flat Earth believers being on the far other end of the spectrum.

""Here we show that dogs have accumulated nonsynonymous changes in mitochondrial genes at a faster rate than wolves, leading to elevated levels of variation in their proteins. This suggests that a major consequence of domestication in dogs was a general relaxation of selective constraint on their mitochondrial genome. If this change also affected other parts of the dog genome, it could have facilitated the generation of novel functional genetic diversity. This diversity could thus have contributed raw material upon which artificial selection has shaped modern breeds and may therefore be an important source of the extreme phenotypic variation present in modern-day dogs.""

&amp;#x200B;

Evolution is not constrained to a ""lottery pick"" of already-existing genes.  The genome is constantly mutating to produce new variation, and selection (and other processes) simply weeds out the bad variations.  There is no shortage of novel variation to select from, and new variation happens all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How can organisms 'advance' into more complexity, if they are in reality, '**devolving', and decreasing in variability**?

As the papers cited above show, your question is built on a flawed premise.  In general, organisms are not ""devolving"" or ""decreasing in variability"".  Sure, decrease in variability occurs, but it's the exception rather than the rule.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How do you reconcile the OBSERVABLE reality of fewer traits being available, in a 'low diversity' organism, with the belief that they are constantly adding new traits, genes, chromosomes, etc? How could common ancestry be possible, when organisms DECREASE in variability, through natural or man made selection?

Are you asserting that ALL populations are low-diversity?  Because you've cited exactly one source in this post, and it discusses the fact that ONE particular species is low-diversity.  If snow leopards are low-diversity, what's that got to do with all the other life on Earth?  Can't E. coli be high-diversity even if snow leopards are low-diversity?

You also seem to be asserting that organisms (or perhaps you mean populations) decrease in variability over time, as a rule.  Could you provide a citation which supports this assertion?",1579543483

Perhaps u/WorkingMouse could step back in and point you to what they already said. I agree that the children of creationists tend to be creationists and that’s one of the many problems with religion as lies are promoted as truth and most effective on young impressionable children with the effect of them believing it strongly enough to continue the process of misinforming their progeny but once they no longer realize that what they promote is true is actually false I wouldn’t say they are lying. You can be wrong without being a liar. 

The human body **is** complex but evolution fully explains how it evolved. For example, every human is the product of their parents having sex and if we take this back generation after generation eventually these ancestors start looking a lot more like Homo sapiens idaltu until they are members of that subspecies. Keep going and the ancestor is something like Homo rhodesiensis, further yet Homo heidelbergensis, then Homo antecessor, then Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo habilis and so forth. There are several competing species for our link between Homo and Australopithecus that have been classified as each, plus a more recent discovery than any that I’m about to mention here that may be the actual “missing link.” Australopithecus sediba, Kenyanthropus platyops, and Homo rudolfensis are three such intermediates even if our ancestry doesn’t flow through any of them directly just like the Homo heidelbergensis mentioned earlier may actually represent the split from our lineage that branched off to become Homo neanderthalensis and Homo denisova. If that’s the case Homo rhodesiensis or Homo sapiens idaltu split from Homo antecessor directly instead. Within Australopithecus there are several intermediates such as Australopithecus ghari, Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus afarensis, and Australopithecus anamensis on the gracile side of things (like us) and they likely diverged from the more robust hominins like Paranthropus bosei before this. Before Australopithecus there are two known species of Ardipithecus, and a couple species categorized into a couple different genuses like Ororrin and Sahelanthropus before we get to the split in hominini between what would become human and what would become chimpanzees and bonobos. And still we are talking about complex life but no longer talking about humans as evolution has demonstrated and explained the origin of humans without having to match all the way back to abiogenesis. Move the goal post and the process continues all the way back to every other clade we are still part of, the origin of life, planetary formation, nuclear fusion, the other physical processes that account for everything within the universe like stars, galaxies, black holes, dust clouds and a few ideas exist to explain dark matter and dark energy that don’t require a supernatural explanation and yet the same physics, the one that tells us how everything actually is, also keeps our smoke detectors working and allows us to determine how long ago some event occurred because of radiometric dating. We can also calibrate the more recent events with molecular clock dating, dendrochronology, ice cores and several other methods related to how light is reflected. The observed speed of light and trigonometry determining the observed distance to a far away object is also a powerful dating method when considering the observable part of the cosmos, called the observable universe because if we can see it and we know the minimum amount of time necessary to see it we know how much time has passed at a minimum. If it takes 13.8 billion years for the light to reach us then it was *at least* 13.8 billion years ago that the light first traveling in our direction and for other reasons I shouldn’t have to discuss here as we are far beyond biology even in your comment about the age of the planet, light can’t travel any faster. This is a fundamental principle in physics and is the basis for Einstein’s relativity that provided the framework for a Catholic priest to suggest that the theory predicts universal expansion and when they set out to test the hypothesis, essentially proving Lamaître right, they were mocked for thinking that the entire universe could come from a “Big Bang” so the name stuck despite not actually being an explosion of anything but likely a continuation of eternal inflation far beyond the limits of general relativity to fully explain and even quantum mechanics starts to fall apart. Before the Big Bang, expansion was already going on, before that is anyone’s guess. Despite the complete lack of evidence and the physical impossibility, this is what deism attempts to explain with a god of the gaps fallacy. Starting with this and giving it qualities that make it the god of Christianity or one of the gods of Hinduism or Ahura Mazda would already be unsupported human invented concepts and the books portraying these different types of god are evidently the creation of groups of people holding subjective opinions about what may not even exist who wrote these myths about creation. It is theses myths in the Bible and the calculations of Ussher that provide the view that we live on a planet created in 4004 BC though we have cities, trees, fossils older than this. The global flood, the exodus out of Egypt, and other things the Bible claims happened also never happened but this discussion was supposed to be about creationism vs evolution- a religious myth vs a scientific theory and not about whether or not there is a god. Even with a god, the universe is evidently at least 13.8 billion years old. Even with a god, our planet is still 4.5-4.6 billion years old. Even with a god, the origin of life is called abiogenesis not avra kadavra and even with a god, evolution is both a fact and the theory that adequately describes it.",1579538528

It is also quite common in our history of understanding the universe that a god of the gaps has slipped in from time to time. The origin of the universe, the motions of the stars, diseases, fertility, plate tectonics, death, life, seizures, the seasons and many other things were once thought to be, pretty unanimously, the work of a supernatural power. Different religions may explain this supernatural power differently but essentially it falls into “we don’t know, therefore magic” until we found out the truth in each of these situations. Theism is predicated on this fallacy but it takes a few more fallacies and outright lies to go from “a god exists therefore Genesis 1 is accurate history, but ignore what happens on day two because we know now that the Earth isn’t flat or covered by a solid metal dome separating primordial waters from the blue sky.”",1579535548

Yes, no evidence. Because going from many alleles to few looks different from going from few alleles to many. They are not merely opposite processes.

Mice however have a generation time that is \~125 times faster than humans (\~10 weeks) so mice serve as a perfect sentinel species for genetic entropy: if we see mice suddenly go downhill, then maybe Sanford has a story.

The problems with this are manifold.

1. Even if we take Sanford's young earth timeline, mice and humans are both \~6000 years old, so if GE is rapid and abrupt (and actually exists) and mice suddenly take a nosedive in the next ten years, we know we have 750,000 years of prep time before we follow suit.

3. Mice are fine. Absolutely fine. Mutational accumulator mice (as noted in the link at the top) are NOT fine, and they have a mutation rate \~17x times higher than regular mice, so *too many mutations per generation* absolutely are a thing, but regular mice do not have this problem, and have been around for a long, long time. So genetic entropy does not appear to exist in...you know, actual wild-type species.

Nobody disagrees with this definitional truth, but please stop ignoring that there are other mechanism at work in evolution than just selection. Let me repeat that *No-one says that selection is the only factor in evolution* mutation is also required.

&gt; Creationism posits a beginning, when the genetic ancestors were full of their original diversity, then depleted to less diversity, and even extinction, as the tips of the phylogenetic tree were reached. 'Decreasing diversity', is the prediction of creationism.

At the starting (In Biblical creationism) created population of humans there were 2 people, so at most each gene could only have a max of 4 allele variations. (Then most love got reduces back to a pair on animals during the flood again reducing the variation to 4 allele sets per species/baramin) Given that currently there is far more variety in most creatures than 4 alleles per gene, I think that something is obviously deeply wrong with this hypothetical.

One of these forms of evidence is even admissible in court, but even this doesn’t apply to creationism because they didn’t witness it happening to create a first hand account of the events and evidently whoever wrote Genesis wasn’t around to witness it either so that we don’t even have second hand testimony. The problem with testimony is that anything that counts as evidence by a more strict definition takes precedence such that it doesn’t matter what you claim happen or how many people dream about you doing it or can be coaxed into providing an account fundamentally identical to your first hand account of the events of the camera tells a different story.

Their evidence isn’t demonstrated truth consistent with one option over any other, as evolution explains what they get right and creationism can’t explain the true nature of what they get wrong. Scientific evidence is out. It isn’t evidence in terms of legally admissible and compelling in court. And when it comes to debate they utterly fail when it comes to facts and logic to support a creator god, a younger age of the planet, separate ancestry, a mechanism by which creation occurred that can be tested or anything else that wouldn’t immediately get tossed out of court. Anything they do provide that can be tested has been proven wrong in science. Their position is one of faith and fallacy from an argument from authority (scripture or a creationist spokesperson), to personal incredulity combined with a god of the gaps (I don’t know how that happened so god did it), to outright lying (aware that there are fossil transitions supporting evolution but saying otherwise to deceive). 

If they had anything that qualifies as evidence **supporting** their position instead of their feeble attempts at discrediting one available alternative (the scientific consensus) they don’t provide it.

t1_ff27ae3,t3_emxcfo,"&gt;While Gods witness on origins is the first hypothesis for me 

Which assumes that your god is both real and that Genesis was literal. Considering how they very people that put it in the Bible thought it was metaphorical and how Genesis 1 says Adam was made after plants and animals with Eve being made at the same time while Genesis 2 says that he made before animals and plants and Eve was made after them, saying it is literal just falsifies your entire religion. So that is not a good reason to deny science.

&gt; i am confident that there is not accurate evidence for the African origin thing.

Your confidence is based on the assumption you are right, which is based on assumptions based on some weird theology, not any flaw in the evidence or any evidence or supporting a different area. For you accuracy is based on whether on not something fits your preconceptions instead of the methods. Confirmation bias is not going to get you any closer to the truth.

&gt;As I said easily dNA diversity in Africa could come from a need to diversify from envirorment problems.

Which is nothing more than special pleading because, as I have repeatably stated, numerous other human population also lived similar or worse environments and do not show the same result.

Also, all attempts to see how populations adapt to new conditions have shown the exact same thing: mutations happening at the same rate as they before but those with mutations that make them better at surviving the new conditions having higher odds of survival, leading to the gene in question slowly becoming more prevalent in the population. What you say would happen never does.  

&gt; the rest of the joining the dots also can be seen as special cases for the OBVIOUS case that sub saharan africans are the most different peoples in slightly more traits then the nexy groups.

So? The original human population being more genetically diverse would also predict them being more phenotypically diverse. It would be odd if they weren't (which the population you assert was the original isn't). And no other mechanism can account for that diversity without a very far back point of divergence from other populations. And the possible genomes for the population that would leave them as even vaguely consistent with what the original population would look like being ridiculously specific, and they fit it perfectly Add in fossils saying the exact same thing, and the evidence of humanity coming out of Africa is very, very strong.

You have yet to show anything against it, and have been desperate to avoid mentioning the other lines of evidence besides genetics saying the exact same thing. Nor have you offered any actual evidence to support your position, just hand waving and special pleading to try to keep believing what your holy books claims, which as shown above, is likely not even what it claims (and certainly is not, if you assume it is true and without contradiction).",1579500501

I’m not nearly as much of an expert in biology (especially genetics) but I’d add that if creationism was even remotely true this would have been demonstrated a long time ago. Besides the points refuted a thousand times, such as there being no beneficial mutations, the watchmaker argument, or it taking more faith to believe in evolution than creation their arguments tend to misrepresent (lie about) the evidence, quote mine the findings, focus on the faults of scientists instead of what they got right, or are personal incredulity fallacies. This whole idea with genetic entropy is already refuted by all of the other evidence for the age of the Earth and common ancestry but when examining the claim directly it fails even harder as the majority of mutations don’t result in disease, infertility, or death and the ones that do result in infertility or death don’t get passed on. After several hundred thousand year Homo sapiens are still around and so are chimpanzees that diverged from our lineage around six to seven million years ago with a very small difference even by comparing the whole genome. As expected, the non-functional DNA contains the most variance such that 98.4% similarity in coding genes equates to only about 96% similarity across the entire genome between humans and chimpanzees but by the time we get to about 90% similarity between mice and men the entire genome is only about 50% identical, especially when we account for genes located on different chromosomes more often in more distantly related populations and located in the same location on the same chromosomes in the most closely related organism. And then when we account for pseudogenes being non-functional because of the same mutation across an entire clade or the evidence found in the acquisition and inheritance of endogenous retroviruses and molecular clock dating matching closely with the fossil record and the methods for dating the remains everything is stacked in favor of evolution, an old Earth, and common ancestry - **especially** among the apes. It is ironic that they’ll accept common ancestry for all bears, for all dogs, for all cats, all moths, and even all non-human monkeys sometimes but they can’t or won’t accept common ancestry between populations in more exclusive clades like hominini, hominina, or the genus Homo.

The actual complexity of current life after 4 billion years of evolution following several hundred thousand year of chemistry giving rise to life is supposed to support a young Earth and a recent creation how? The same scientists that reveal the complexity also explain how it  evolved when they examine the evidence. The actual details are inconsistent with separate ancestry, intelligent design, and supernatural intervention where some of the traits being so specific and unique that they most likely only evolved once and when multiple lineages share this trait - the same genes in the same locations surrounded by the same endogenous retroviruses in the same locations surrounded by pseudogenes and other matching garbage it points to common ancestry via a process prone to mutations. Some of these lead to death or infertility and don’t get passed on while the rest, especially any beneficial ones, tend to spread throughout the population so long as they are still genetically inter-fertile because if they’re genetically isolated for long enough they diverge into separate species (meaning they can no longer produce fertile offspring) and these mutations are only found to be nearly identical within one group providing the evidence of speciation in the past. Some times separate lineages converge on a similar trait because of the environment but without matching each other exactly because of how they develop independently and don’t spread their unique traits to each other after they are no longer inter-fertile. 

All of the evidence is consistent with a mindless process occurring over millions and billions of years such that after six million years chimpanzees and humans look very different to us yet they are still 98.4% identical to us genetically just considering the known coding regions and still 96% the same when accounting for all of the genetic differences such as the merged chromosome or the mutations in the junk DNA that doesn’t do anything but take up space. If it takes six million years for that much divergence then it takes even more to account for humans and mice being 90% identical in the coding regions and 50% identical by whole genome comparison accounting for junk like ancient viral gene and the broken protein coding gene mutations that show a clear evolutionary relationship but a more distant one. This is the same way we test for paternity but going much much further back and the same way we test for how long ago modern humans split from the ancestral Y chromosome haplogroup A and the mitochondria haplogroup L lived but with whole genome comparison provides us an estimate for how long ago the most recent common ancestor of a clade was alive.

In the context of a evolution VERSUS creationism the meaning is that part of ""evolution' that disagree with creationism. This is beyond obvious(and an embarrassment that so many of your friends can't comprehend such simplicity) and doesn't make you the lest bit smart to not recognize.

&gt;Then you try to support the creationist's argument by asking how he's wrong asking about new body plans or new clades back to orders in the modern age from single-celled organisms.

Only I didn't and you are just showing an incapability to reason and process.   I very directly stated i am not  a creationist but question how ecoli shows the emergence of new body plans in the link he provided since he was implying an answer to the point quoted.

That doesn't mean you can't answer it but that THAT does not answer it. learn to process not merely emote.  It will make your points better.",1579462772
t1_feqtv7n,t3_eq7yjj,"&gt;... we’re talking about billions of years ago way before actual life and when genetics were first becoming a thing so the evidence used for evolution, for example, isn’t going to tell us for sure what the prebiotic chemistry leading to life was.

&amp;nbsp;
I'm not a YEC but I can't imagine how such a person can read, ""when genetics were first becoming a thing,"" and NOT think that they are dealing (debating) with people who have no clue about how some primitive ""first life"" could have ""transformed"" into present-day, complex life (you and I).

&gt;Now, you could argue (as other YECs have done in the past) that any observations we make *in the here and now* cannot be regarded as relevant to stuff that's supposed to have happened *billions of years ago*, cuz how can we be sure that physical laws have stayed the same all this time? Well… maybe we *can't* be *100% absolutely certain* that physical laws have stayed the same. But we can look for indications that things may have been different in the past. Obviously, that does nothing to refute the notion that some sort of omnipotent trickster ...

&amp;nbsp;
I would think that any scientist ***assumes*** equivalent physical laws in effect at the speculative time of life referenced in the OP and those in effect at the time of the present-day, scientific experiment. We can be ***certain*** that conditions on the ground were nothing like they are today, requiring scientists to make an educated guess at those *conditions*. ***But that is just the beginning***: scientists must make an ""educated guess"" about the precise physical nature of the life referenced in the OP.",1579460618

No...theres a lot worse you can be accused of and have been proven by your  own words as guilty of an no corner of it includes any thing even close to honesty.

Actually, that particular bit was primarily about the definition of design, not evolution. Changes in allele frequency *are* unguided processes. You had accused me of criticising YECism only.

But let's say you're right. The worst I can be accused of here is a slightly sloppy shorthand. I think ""evolutionary history"" is a valid synonym for ""the scientific consensus on the unguided historical process which is responsible for observed biodiversity"". Even if I'm wrong, it's *not* the same as altering the definition of evolution to circumnavigate empirical observation. 

Pretending the two are equivalent is frankly silly.

The simple facts are that all calculations (whether in favor of evolution or against evolution) are based on assumptions which are in turn based on the best available information right now.

That means... they could be wrong.

So if we understand our calculations could be misguided... then there is absolutely no way in hell that someone can claim definitively that there was not enough time.

Any ""problem"" your friend points out probably applies to his calculations as well.

The funniest part of all this is that if he does indeed have a background in Mathematics, he ALREADY KNOWS this.

&gt;It's the validity of that cop-out, in its various guises, that is essentially the premise of debate here.

Problem is even in the Title of your sub you define ""evolution"" as what opposes (versus)  creationism so thereby give them every right to differentiate since its YOUR sub which YOU named and YOU  Define evolution as opposed to.

So is easily proven to be a semantic game where when you use it  the word  means that which is opposed to creationism and when they use it it must include what they agree on.

Why? Is there some new requirement I respond directly to your posts in all threads even when you are not the OP?  Or have you forgotten again I am more in line with theistic evolution  than a creationist (although thats by your definitions not mine). 

&amp;#x200B;

but sure i will respond to that post since you seem to need my review. This is just ignorant  


&gt; but I'm a forking evolutionary biologist. I'm *telling* you what the word ""evolution"" means. You can continue to insist it means something else, but that's just going to make me not take you seriously.

Skipping  what caliber biologist you  are it doesn't mean you set the meaning  of words in all contexts.  That's not a biological field . Thats linguistics.  Invoking an argument from authority  in afield a biologist i not even an authority on (linguistics) is just double fallacious  Furthermore its just dumb to not see  that  Creation vs Evolution  CANNOT be  referencing their agreement but their disagreement or else what are you debating? Your similarities?    


Now if you want me to comment on  your answer to this  

&gt; You can't create new complex information, new body plans, new phyla, classes and probably even orders. 

from a creationist perspective  (even though I am not one) then fine. I''ll play. How in the word does this answer his  quoted issue

t1_ffvb9n0,t3_euzput,"Two separate things here.

First, this is not what I meant. Paul originally said Darwin misunderstood basic probability theory. You've only changed the neutral mutations and the number of base pairs to model the entire genome (Darwin explicitly said he was working with a 1000 base pairs), but you are not otherwise correcting any mathematical flaw in Darwin's point. So this is irrelevant to whether or not his maths is ""totally insane"", or whether he is incorrectly modelling independent probabilities, which he is just not.

(Note that Paul ended up saying [he hadn't even evaluated the maths](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/ffthi8a/), *after* he felt qualified to dismiss it as bunk. He doubled down on his own misunderstanding. It was a futile discussion.)

But, looking at your argument on its independent merits, I have two main immediate issues:

Firstly, you're making the classic creationist assumption of the perfect starting genome. That's the only way you get 200 million into that equation, and it's not something any evolutionist would accept. Populations that exist now have by definition been reproducing for hundreds of millions of years and regions of the genome that are *effectively* non-functional may well have reached that equilibrium long ago.

Secondly, the 20k years to extinction is an assertion with no empirical evidence. Once the fitness effect of a mutation starts to actually matter, selection will kick in. And yes, that threshold will often be much higher than the equilibrium point for deleterious/beneficial mutations.",1580261418
t3_evdw0f,t3_evdw0f,How is it possible to have the genetic diversity present in human beings from a single source? (Eve was created of Adam),1580260701
t1_fftgxsh,t3_euzput,"OK, I just modeled his equilibrium thing, but with more accurate values. I used 0.1/0/99.9 b/n/d. This is because, as Paul pointed out, there are no neutral mutations, only effectively neutral. But, I’ll give Darwin the benefit of the doubt by using his definition of neutral mutations for the calculation.

I also used 3000000000 (3 bil) for possible mutation sites, because this is the approximate size of the human genome. If there are any other animal genome sizes you would want to measure this with, just divide my result by 3 bil/ genome size.

Anyway,
&gt; But as deleterious mutations accumulate, the ratio changes, just like the simple examples above. Where’s the crossover point? 

The crossover point for the human genome is, not 7, not 330, but *998 million mutations*. By dividing this by 100 mutations per gen, then multiplying for 20 years per gen, I got that it would take *200 million years to reach equilibrium*.

OK, so since genetic entropy would take only about 20 thousand years to degrade the genome to extinction, I believe it is clear that equilibrium cannot save evolution.

From the introduction:

&gt;The proceedings include the research findings of 29 scientists who represent a diverse spectrum  of  scientific  disciplines,  including information  theory,  computer  science, numerical simulation, thermodynamics, evolutionary theory, whole  organism biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, genetics, physics, biophysics, mathematics, and linguistics.These scientists generally agreed on three crucial points:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Information  is  the  key  to  understanding life.  Within  the  simplest  cell there exists  an immense flow  of  information  through  a  mind-boggling  system  of information  networks.  There  is  constant  and  multidirectional  communication between   proteins,   RNAs,   and   DNAs,   and   these   biological   information networks are in many ways comparable to the internet.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. These   biological   information   systems   appear   to   greatly   surpass   human information  technologies.  Such  information  systems  cannot  possibly  operate until  all  the  countless  components  of  the  system  are  in  place -including hardware, software, multiple languages, storage/transmission of communicable prescriptive  information  units,  error  testing/correction  systems,  designated senders/receivers,  etc.    Such  systems  must  be  comprehensive  and  coherently integrated   before   they   can   effectively   operate.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. The   enormous   amounts   of   information   found   within   any   cell,   and   the irreducibly complex nature of information systems, can no longer rationally be attributed  to just the  mutation/selection process. New perspectives are  needed that  might  help  us  better  understand  the  nature,  origin,  and  maintenance  of biological information.",1580255495
t1_ffuxym2,t3_eupqxz,"&gt;Litterally all the support for this you've presented has been mined quotes that don't actually say anything on the distribution.

That's completely wrong. You've got blinders on, but I can't take them off for you. Only you can choose to do that. I understand that it won't be easy, because if you do that you'll have to abandon your whole worldview and start fresh. Nobody really wants to have to do that.",1580252383
t1_ffuxym2,t3_eupqxz,"&gt;  You shouldn't make any assumption at all.

Without assuming at the very least a net zero effect (normal distribution), there's no way you can even cling to any hope that evolution might work. But I don't even think that would save it because even if you ignore all the neutrals, the net effect of all the other mutations is still deleterious! So at best you'd have NS working to remove everything and barely managing to keep things at a constant level. You'd still never get forward evolution.

&gt;That's actually the most egregious quote you've presented so far because the paper you took that from is all about showing the opposite of the point you're trying to prove.

If you read what I wrote, I acknowledged that. The whole point of that paper is that they are saying ""nearly neutral damaging mutations are well-known, but if that's all we've got then evolution won't work. We have to find a way to show that there are beneficial mutations to balance them out."" And I don't think they were successful. For one thing they make one assumption that is known to be bad: they assume that synonymous mutations are ""neutral"" (in context I think they mean of no effect at all). [But that's known to be false.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45952)",1580251856
t1_ffuuq5o,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; Cars that did reproduce would be even more complex than the ones we do have. Making that irrelevant. And what does the assumption of beginnings have to do with my statement here? Nothing. What we do have now is a highly complex machine, just like cars.

Reproducing organisms face selection and a beginning assumption is required if you think that an infentesimally small change, immeasurable change is going to be almost always in one direction.

&gt; Again, there are no zeros.

Centered. C e n t e r e d. An average effect of zero, not an individual effect of zero.

&gt;  or you are going to have to take the completely counterintuitive step of claiming that the distribution of effects will be totally different for small mutations, compared to large; and there's no reason at all to say that.

No. You shouldn't make any assumption at all. There is no data to support any distribution. It's immeasurable by definition.

&gt; Helpful enough to somehow counteract all the decline we know is definitely happening.

Litterally all the support for this you've presented has been mined quotes that don't actually say anything on the distribution.

&gt; Although we expect slightly advantageous mutations to exist, currently there is only limited evidence for their existence in real populations

That paper is all about measurable fitness effects (so not the neutral ones that are topical) and they go in to demonstrate their hypothesis of their existence with a natural experiment. That's actually the most egregious quote you've presented so far because the paper you took that from is all about showing the opposite of the point you're trying to prove.",1580251475

&gt;It actually does. You can have one large beneficial change, 40 huge deleterious changes, and everything else centered at net 0 and still have average deleterious.

Again, there are no zeros. All of them are either beneficial or deleterious. So you are forced into the spot where you can either admit that they are going to have the same distribution, roughly, regardless of size, or you are going to have to take the completely counterintuitive step of claiming that the distribution of effects will be totally different for small mutations, compared to large; and there's no reason at all to say that.

See the corner you're backed into now? You're pinning all your hopes for evolution on the prospect that somehow, a big proportion of very tiny mutations are helpful. Helpful enough to somehow counteract all the decline we know is definitely happening.

But our friends the experts paint a different picture, even as they attempt furiously to rescue the theory of evolution by searching out these beneficial mutations:

t1_ffurp1n,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; So you're suggesting that all the info we know about mutations that comes from the kind that we can measure should just be thrown out the window and ignored when it comes to mutations that are too small to measure? Somehow the likelihood of beneficial vs deleterious would be completely different for these two classes? I'm not buying that for an instant.

You should not make assumptions of quantitative effects when you cant quantify them.

If you get an A-&gt;G mutation in a nonregualtory, nonexpressed, nonbinding region of the genome, you shouldn't assume it will have a deleterious effect when the only differences known are the use of one less carbon and one more nitrogen.

&gt; You want to really understand mutations? Pick any complex machine, like a car for example. Then take a hammer and pick any component of that machine at random and hit it with your hammer. Hit it really hard, and that's a mutation with measurable fitness impact. Hit it softly and now you've got a nearly neutral mutation. Is that clear enough for you?

Cars don't reproduce and we cant assume the genome was optimized to begin with.

&gt; As Gerrish et al put it, mutations are ""indiscriminate alterations"" of complexity, and as such, by nature they are bound to be more deleterious on average than beneficial. Whether they are small or large changes makes no difference.

Not a position on whether or not the near neutral mutations are deleterious, only that they have fitness effects. 

&gt; ""In summary, the vast majority of mutations are deleterious. This is one of the most well-established principles of evolutionary genetics, supported by both molecular and quantitative-genetic data.""

That paper is based on a bunch of other papers that measured fitness effects. Doesn't talk about mutations that are effectively neutral. Its obvious you're misinterpreting his words too, because the first paper you cited is also written by him, and his entire section on neutral mutations is summed up by ""it depends,"" and never actually quantifies probability within the category of neutral. He does explicitly say though that ""...as little as 5% and as much as 50% of mutations are deleterious"" in non-coding regions (a significant portion of eukaryotes genomes) depending on the organism. For humans, that value was 5%.

&gt; Even the simplest of living organisms are highly complex. Mutations—indiscriminate alterations of such complexity—are much more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

Again, not a paper that looks at neutral mutation effects. This is a paper about quantifying mutation impacts. We're talking mutations that impact too little to quantify.

This is a discussion on whether or not changing the genome size affects the rate of back mutations, not whether or not those are frequent to begin with. For point mutations, (not assuming that your first mutations are guaranteed to happen), the chance of a point mutation swapping back is more or less (mutation rate)*1/3. This is independent of genome size when mutation rate is a metric of mutations/base.

This becomes more important as you saturate the genome with deleterious mutations, because a higher percentage of bases that mutate will have mutated already, but what a critical threshold of non-viability for an individual is, what status modern populations are, or whether or not it matters to a large population's viability is a matter where you and I disagree, but it does not change the math for back mutation rate on a per-loci level.",1580240714

My formulas consider that scenario.

When I said it is highly misleading, that is another way of calling it a red herring. It is true that if you look at a given possible mutation, its independent probability is the same as its back mutation, at least in theory. But the reason I said that is wrong to say that is because we are not looking at independent probabilities in the discussion of back mutations.

We are asking, after a mutation has occurred, what is the likelihood that it will back mutate? And the chances of that turn out to be very low, and it's easy to see why. If you want to keep trying to prop up that sinking ship, go right ahead, you can sink right along with him.",1580217736

(not unlike behes first rule of adaptive evolution)  with obvious remnants of capacity, but a natural strain like the patagonian one they are working with is likely more robust... and *known to be able to hybridize maltotriose fermentation*

From the article

TDES and NGAK are employees of the beer brewing company HEINEKEN B.V. NB, ARGdV, NGAK and JMGD are inventors of a patent application related to this work

..And this..

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4448586/

"" Article 5 provides that the simple discovery of the sequence or partial sequence of a gene cannot constitute a patentable invention. However, the sequence or partial sequence of a gene isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process may constitute a patentable invention even if its structure is identical to that of a natural element...""

So what are the requisites??

""A claimed sequence must also satisfy requirements of novelty and inventive step, the latter being considered primarily using the tests of “obvious to try” and reasonable expectation of success..""


So in order to patent its gotta have a degree of novelty?🤔
And since this patent would give heinekin a 20 year edge on tackling the 15-25% maltotriose content of wort for lagers which constitute a $250b-yr industry,  I'd say that's motive for calling it

Just like him, you're missing the point. Yes it's equally likely. A second coin toss is also equally likely no matter how many times you toss it. But that's not how probabilities work. I wonder, do science majors have to take math classes or what??",1580162468

If you mutate an error correcting mechanism, you increase or decrease mutation rate, so that would be the only example where mutations are (baring shit like the butterfly effect) not independent events. 

In reality its even more complicated than that, because 'back mutation' doesn't necessarily mean a reversion.

t1_ffrix3p,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; This is incredible. I'm finished with this exchange, so Paul can respond however, because he's so far off base and obviously not going to magically start understanding how probability works.  
&gt;  
&gt;For everyone else:  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a coin, and I ask ""what's the probability that I get tails twice in a row?""  
&gt;  
&gt;The answer is .25; 0.5 for the first toss, 0.5 for the second, they are independent, so you multiply the separate probabilities to get the combined probability.  
&gt;  
&gt;I flip the first coin. Tails.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I ask ""what's the probability of a second tails?""  
&gt;  
&gt;The answer is 0.5. I already did the first toss. It came up tails. That probability is now 1, because that event has already occurred in the past. And the probability of tails on the second toss is 0.5.  
&gt;  
&gt;It works the same for mutations. The probability of two mutations at any one site is extremely low. But if a mutation happens, the probability of the back mutation is approximately the same as the original mutation that already occurred.  
&gt;  
&gt;Paul, I can keep explaining this *to* you, but I can't understand it *for* you.

u/DarwinZDF42 You still get no points for your wrong answer, even if you include an attempted justification for it. Yes, the probability is .5 for each toss. But for any selection of possible tosses, the probability is multiplied. Lightning almost never strikes the same place twice at random. Now if you happen to have a lightning rod there, we're talking a whole different story.",1580160142
t1_ffri1h8,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; The first toss already happened. It's in the past. The probability is one.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I asked ""what's the probability of, in the future, a mutation occurring, *followed by* its back mutation"", you'd be on track. But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, *given that a mutation has already occurred*, what is the probability of the back mutation occurring?

u/DarwinZDF42  
Where we stand in time is irrelevant. The probability of two tails in a row is always going to be 1/4, regardless of whether we are in the middle of flipping or whether we have not yet flipped.",1580158932

u/DarwinZDF42 . I just don't know what more I can do to explain this to you.

&gt;  
&gt;Look.  
&gt;  
&gt;Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. *Assuming all are equally likely* (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30.  
&gt;  
&gt;With me so far? Great.  
&gt;  
&gt;So the first A mutates to G.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates *back* to A?  
&gt;  
&gt;Got it now?

u/DarwinZDF42 The probability of getting both those mutations together is 1/30 \* 1/30, which is 1/900.",1580157577
t1_ffrep0z,t3_eupqxz,[deleted],1580157453
t1_ffrb6os,t3_eupqxz,"&gt;Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A after that first mutation happens. In the second instance, the first mutation has already happened. Its probability is 1. So we're considering the two events independently, and the probabilities are approximately equal. With me?

u/DarwinZDF42 I can literally remember having this same mental block when I was learning about this in high school. How can the probability be different when you're flipping the same coin? How does the first flip influence the probability of getting the same result any number of times in a row? The way I got past this block was to realize that we are not considering them independently at all. We are asking the question, what is the probability of these two independent events both happening? You would never expect to keep flipping a coin over and over and get the same result each time, even though that is technically possible and even though the probability (1/2) is the same each time. It's multiplicative. Each time you flip. the odds of flipping it again to get the same result go down by an order of magnitude.

This is also why we find it highly strange to see that lightning has struck the same place twice. Because lighting can strike anywhere, and there are lots of places for it to strike. This is why back mutations are negligible. And that's one reason why you'll never reach this imaginary equilibrium you keep talking about.",1580156566
t1_ffrbcsu,t3_eupqxz,"C -&gt; T and G - &gt; A mutations are more likely because of the instability of C. Areas with a lot of short repeats are more likely to mutate, mostly due to cross over although I think it's a phenomenon that also happens in organisms that don't cross-over when they reproduce. Transposible elements can be biased in their insertion sites.

The odds of a mutation happening are probably independent events, with the exception of a mutation altering error correcting mechanisms of DNA replication. While still independent events, you'll never see an adult with a set of synthetic lethal mutations due to the nature of those mutations.",1580155814

Neither does anybody else. For the purpose of theory, they are generally assumed to be random, but that's more of a placeholder for ""we don't know"".

t3_eupqxz,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; This possibility is so rare and unlikely as to be completely negligible when considering our fitness distribution. Back mutations are like having lighting strike at the same spot twice, since mutations are random and the genome is very, very large.

 Then Paul objects to bit on back mutations - when A--&gt;B happens, then later B--&gt;A happens. He says that's too rare to consider.

It's not strictly equal, but close enough for a model as rough as this, considering just the number of possible mutations on each side of the ledger.

Think about this: the human genome contains 3 billion base pairs. 
* DarwinZDF42 isn't clear on why epistasis is supposed to help his case. The fact that mutations interact actually makes the whole problem worse for various reasons. For one thing, synergistic epistasis means they work together. This means that the damage caused by multiple deleterious mutations becomes not just additive, but exponential, as the mutations are worse in combination than they would be apart!

yes I'm saying , not evolution by the way, that upon migration to areas like s america and australia simply like , minor , features were adapted. 

its not simple and impossible there was both placentals and marsupials landing in aussieland and poof there was great death of placentals. creatures back then were stronger to fulfill gods plan of quick repop\[ulation of a post flood world. There is no reason or evidence of a massive die off.

however the great evidence , beyond common sense, is that the marsupials are perfect matches for thier cousins elsewhere.

 I suggest you look on the internet/youtibe at moving/still pictures of the last marsupial wolf in a zoo. iTS a dog! not a flexible wombat! its clearly a canine and just barks at the fact its marsupial traits were chump change.

Looking at this diagram, (https://imgur.com/a/ewPb0ly), layers 6-11 show trilobite fossils, and other early marine life. In layers 4 and 5, you find fossil ferns, wood, terrestrial insects and animals, etc. Layer 3 is an entire fossilized desert, with animal tracks and fossilized sand dunes (and no dinosaurs, mammals, birds, etc. in 3,4, or 5, just reptiles, as predicted by Old Earth). Then you get to layers 1 and 2, and suddenly it's corals, bony fish, and a few trilobites.

Honestly, I don't see how fossils laid down by a global flood would include animal tracks on solid ground to begin with. I've never thought of that - how is that accounted for? In this case, I think they could only argue that the topmost layers are flood, and everything else is pre-flood. But then how would deposition of all those previous layers be accounted for? For example, the paper you linked claims there are no fossil mammals in the grand canyon because they sheltered elsewhere from the flood - but the flood couldn't have even happened at that point, since there are fossilized animal tracks in sand dunes.

Concede the evidence we have in hand, outside a literal reading of Genesis, the case for deep time is favored right now, but future discoveries could change that.   

I'm a Young Earth/Young Cosmos creationists, and I've studied astorphysics, cosmology, general relativity.   The most you can hope for is to throw doubt into some of the mainstream ideas.  If you go around pretending the evidences we have to day is slam dunk for a young cosmos, you'll lose credibility.

A mathematical physicist friend of mine said there is much we don't know, but if life is young, and the fossil record is young, and hence a good part of the literal reading of genesis is confirmed, why not be open to the possibility other things are young. 

Talk about how variable speed of light is put on the table by mainstream physicists to solve problems in the Big Bang hypothesis. There is also the inflation hypothesis where the amount of matter of all the buzzillion galaxies we can see was postulated to move a thousands if not millions of times faster than the speed of light -- how is this any more outrageous than anything the YECs say?

The Big Bang suffers a lot of problems and in 2019 many articles came out saying cosmology is in crisis.

Point out the case for creation has improved over the last several decades but there are problems.  If the trend continues of more facts over time being revealed that support a literal reading of Genesis as history, then we should expect evidence that will help solve problems in the YEC/YCC models.

That's a honest answer.


&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

What do you mean, ""Science sides""?  We can only speak of the facts we have available, but what we have available to us today is a minuscule sample of all the facts we might be able to discover.  Most scientists will say deep time.   Does that make it right.   If you ask, ""what do the facts say""  are you talking about the facts we have available to us today, or do you think maybe we don't have as many facts to settle the case.  I'd say, we don't have many facts as we'd like. That's why cosmology is in crisis.

Don't expect you'll defeat your opponent on astronomy today, maybe some years down the line if God grants more facts.


You will have a good case for a young fossil record and young life.  There are a few creationists who think the fossil record is young but the universe is old.  Not that I agree with that position, but make clear the case for Noah's flood doesn't necessarily depend on the solar system being young, it only depends on the fossil record being young.",1579936989

Weltanschauung, originally intended as a stab at objectivity is self defeating. It, by virtue of an excess of brute apriori assumptions negates its own ability to positivity verify its claims. 

""in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Dilthey intended to fashion a critique of reason on behalf of the historical human or cultural sciences (Geisteswissenschaft ). For Dilthey the goal of natural science was causal explanation, whereas the goal of human sciences was to achieve understanding by means of interpretation. Every interpretation, he reasoned, takes place within a larger understanding of the world (i.e., a Weltanschauung), which itself is historically conditioned. Thus, interpreters of human history and culture must recognize their immersion in a particular historical situation and tradition and in that process come to terms with the finitude of their perspective. The irony of Dilthey’s historicist conclusions lies in the fact that they undermine his original goal of establishing universal validity for judgment in the human sciences. This split or contradiction resulted in differing orientations to the concept of the Weltanschauung among thinkers such as Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.""

The YEC case for craters should be that the big ones hit earth when no people in the way. Thus after the fall.

Thus a tiny, tiny, bit of shrapnel got through. after the flood only small impacts in the most remote areas have hit. Likewise craters on the moon probably all hit at that time. I read, vaguely, that most moon craters are on one side thus this unlikely if they are random over long timelines. Perhaps wiki the moon. Anyways crators are episodic surely.

Geneis clearly teaches light was created on day one and was everywhere. Then divided for boundaries. Nothing to do with sources of light like our sun/stars. This means its impossible. I think. that light moves from here to there. So there is no speed of light. Instead just light poking out from some provocation. After this then light is not proven to be coming from stars from long ago. Its complicated as a option. its not proven light comes from deep time. Its just a line of reasoning from present rates of saying light moves from here to there.

The asteroids simply , as a option, are more of the same as the origin of crators. Smashed up stuff from events in the past that stay in orbit. They prove the universe is deacyed and decaying.

Stars. The Bible says God created them, and we’ve never observed them formed by any other means. Stars don’t live as long as the current estimated date of the universe, so the current existence of stars is evidence of recent creation.

&gt;  
&gt;2. It kills a lot of people it infects.

&gt;  
&gt;4. We do not know how it spreads, how long it will circulate, or if it will truly go pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. The main thesis I operate under is that viruses that hang out within a species are attenuated. In many cases, they are harmless to the host. But, when they jump to a new species, they burn hot and fast and cause a lot of damage before they either burn out or become weakened. Thus, the appearance of a new virus within humans is a serious concern. No need to panic, but definitely something to study hard. BTW, multiple sequences of this virus are already publicly available.

In 79 Kimura acknowledged that there were no strictly neutral mutations. Then he went back on it later on.  


&gt; Nearly neutral theory also had problems, Kern said: It did not explain, for example, why the rate of evolution varies as observed among different lineages of organisms. 

Is this a problem with near neutral theory, or a problem with the idea of Darwinism?  


&gt; Kern agrees: The neutral mutations are still neutral — but they are not behaving as neutral theory would predict. Purifying selection at linked sites, he wrote, would “add noise to allele frequencies beyond drift,” while background selection and hitchhiking would lead to less genetic variation than under neutrality. 

Hitchhiking is a major problem for evolution of course since very few mutations are 'beneficial' to begin with. But still we see the confusingly vague term ""neutral"" here. Population geneticists affirm that ALL mutations have some effect, so there are no strictly neutral mutations.  


&gt; Parts of this noncoding portion of the genome are riddled with repetitive DNA sequences, caused by transposable genetic elements, or transposons, that copy and insert themselves throughout the genome. According to [Irina Arkhipova](http://www.mbl.edu/jbpc/staff/arkhipova/), a molecular evolutionary geneticist who studies the role of transposons at the Marine Biological Laboratory at the University of Chicago, “this portion of the genome is quintessentially neutral in Kimura’s sense,” even if some fraction of those transposons do affect the expression of genes. 

More of the same hubris in assuming that if we CURRENTLY don't know what something in the genome does, then it must be useless junk and any changes to that region must be 'strictly neutral' with no effect at all on the organism.

Usually, atheists will point to this article and state "" Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while all other great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) have 24 pairs of chromosomes,"" Belen Hurle, Ph.D., says via email. Hurle is a research fellow at the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) at the National Institutes of Health. ""This is because in the human evolutionary lineage, two ancestral ape chromosomes fused at their telomeres \[tips\], producing human chromosome 2. Thus, humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes. This is one of the main differences between the human genome and the genome of our closest relatives."" or something to this effect.  [https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm)  

The problem here is that they see the result and auto assume it's  because of fusion. It's like saying I see the result of a screw being screwed in and think it's the result of a power drill. Possible, but there are other possibilities. It could have been a human manually screwing it in. It could have been a child using a different tool. The point is they jump to the conclusion that it's fused when it could have been created that way with the telomeres matching up 

So now, in order to give evidence for fusion, they must choose one of two paths. Either the fusion happened in one generation or it happened gradually.  

If it happened in one generation, they must prove that the mutation is common enough that a population of 50 (somewhere around this range. I don't remember which paper it was, but just look up population size needed to propagate mutation. It should pop up) within one generation happened otherwise you don't have the necessary population to propagate this mutation.

If it happened gradually, they need to prove each step  of the mutation wouldn't kill the host. Herein also lies another problem. It is well known that extra or missing chromosomes cause problems to the host. Most famous are down syndrome or turner syndrome.  [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions) 

But those with down syndrome or turner syndrome are LESS FIT. There is no way the ""survival of the fittest"" would choose these organisms. Just look at how much care parents have to give to those with down syndrome. I know of no additional or decrease in chromosome that is not either detrimental or simply benign.  Basically, none of these special conditions of having extra or one less chromosome will lead to a more ""fit"" organism. Even if it did, again, they would need to prove the mutation is common enough to support a population that is large enough to propagate this. But again, they need to do this for all steps. It's not enough to show it's common enough and it's fit for one stage. ALL Stages must meet these conditions otherwise the mutation would die off.

That's likely false.   Up to 90% of heritable disease is associated with non-protein coding regions in humans.

&gt;(this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact).

Sure it does for the reasons just stated.  Before you jump to that conclusion considered the D4Z4 repeat:

https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/6/883.full



&gt;This means that almost all deleterious mutations are eventually removed from the gene pool by drift.

Yes, but there will be plenty that remain.  

In Genetic Entropy 2.0 I showed a lot are REMOVED, but that doesn't stop the deterioration.  Do you see that?   You can do that with a very large population and argue 99% are removed, but the problem doesn't go away. 

The reason is, if 70 mutations enter each individual each generation, in 8 billion people, that 56 billion mutations entering the genome per individual per generation.  The problem is that even if billions are removed by killing off billions of people, the individuals  that survive will retain most of the  70 mutations they inherited, so the accounting here is incorrect.  The proper accounting is how many are retained per individual! Not how many are removed from the population!!!!!  Drift talks about removal of mutations from the population, but this doesn't account for how many mutations per individual are retained.  Genetic Entropy 2.0 shows the proper accounting per individual.

&gt;And even if some genes escape genetic drift, once they degrade enough they will be selected against.

Genetic entropy is the accumulation of *slightly* deleterious mutations over time, mutations whose individual effects are so slight that *selection does not weed them out.*  The cumulative effect of these mutations, however, is what destroys the species.

So they're down to 99 no problem.  This can go on until they're down to 12, and maybe no defects.  Once they go down to 11 or less,  they get muscular dystrophe.

Have you seen the Genetic Entropy 2.0 video.  Look at the last 10 minutes or so.  See what happens when the organism doesn't actually die, but just keeps accumulating slight defects with each generation.

You don't even need the 80% figure of ENCODE, just go for 15% and the problem doesn't go away.


One of the problems is ROBUSTNESS or fault tolerance of the genome.  The space shuttle have 5 navigation systems, and if 4 go out, the shuttle keeps going, but if all 5 are out, then its fatal.  The problem is selection won't see fault tolerant systems in the human genome or erase defects in these systems.  Think about that!

That means, these systems are easily degraded and may never recover from the degredation.

First off, enhancers sequences can sit on exons.  So, let's not be too quick to dismiss little changes in DNA sequences even those that are synonymous/silent changes to the proteins, not to mention it affects kinetics of translation.

Selection coefficients are how population geneticists define :

The second is that

&gt; Most mutations are neutral, because deleterious and beneficial mutations only happen in protein-coding genes (this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact). The ones that are deleterious only happen to a small percentage of genes at a time, because there are so many genes in the genome. Since the entire genome isn’t being degraded at once, the wild-type which still exists in the population will survive due to the probabilities of genetic drift.

Is a little off. There are also regulatory regions and functional RNAs (important note is that not all transcribed RNAs are thought to be functional, let alone more significant than small tuning effects). The later is that the reduced selection against humans isn't being fixed by drift, it's just that it's not (as) deleterious in our modern environment.

The labs would not be told anything about the samples. Success would be if the various labs generally agree with each other (without communicating) and the timelines correspond to the old earth paradigm for the strata (for example, lava flows encased in Cambrian sediments are dated older than tertiary samples), and for the known samples, like Vesuvius, St. Helen and others, they would be close enough at +/- 5,000 years.

This is why you get the plateau effect, with anomalous dates at lower temperatures (= rims of the sample) that gradually level out as you get to the real, intrinsic argon.

However, the authors state: 

&gt;""based on the preserved length of the tail and available measurements of the preserved caudal vertebrae, we estimate that a complete caudal series is likely to comprise more than 25 caudal vertebrae""

&gt;Therefore, the preserved segment is only a small mid to distal portion of what was likely a relatively long tail, with the total caudal vertebral count not reasonably less than 15, and likely greater than 25

This is one of the features that leads them to conclude

&gt; the specimen more likely to be a non-avialan theropod as there is only one known avian species (i.e., Jeholornis) with more than 25 caudal vertebrae.

As well, your source doesn't even mention the ventral groove - the main feature used by the authors to taxonomically identify the dinosaur. This is the most important omission, and is rather shameful as it even shows up in the abstract as the main method used to identify the specimen.

&gt;there is a distinctive ventral groove on the caudal centra of the specimen, which is widely distributed among non-avialan theropods but which has yet to be reported in avialans

They also don't mention the closed vanes, a glaring omission given the claim that ""But the only “primitive” feature mentioned is that the rachis (central shaft) of the feathers is somewhat thinner"" which can be seen to be false:

&gt;Why a mean estimate? I'll tell you why:

Sorry, this is my mistake. It’s not of course a mean, it’s an isochron age. So no, they're not levelling anything out... in fact, the lowest temperature steps aren't outliers at all, they’re bang on the isochron (see inset on figure 1).

Also, just above you bolded ""there is no objective basis for excluding the lowest temperature steps, so we prefer the 46 analyses isochron"" as if that were a fudge, and now you're saying they're fudging the apparent ages that they specifically kept *in* with their earlier fudge.

This makes the method *more* accurate, as you only need a single sample for a measurement. This isn't a methodological assumption at all, it's a deliberate choice for the most sensitive measurement.

See what I mean? There's no actual thought process behind your objection. You just see the word ""proxy"" and go AHA!

&gt;Analysis of single crystals, for example by laser fusion, can obviate xenocrystic contamination (5), but single crystals are seldom large enough to yield reliably measurable quantities of 40Ar through radiogenic ingrowth in the Holocene.

Which is why they did NOT do this. How could you possibly have missed that?

&gt;the 40Ar/ 39Ar apparent age (10) calculated from the sum of all gas released is 3300 +- 500 years, clearly distinct within error from the known calendar age. With the known age, the concentration of extraneous 40Ar can be estimated...

*... from the weight of the sample (0.430 g), the total air-corrected 40Ar released (2.9 x 10^14 mol), and the K content (12.5%) of the sanidine, yielding (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^14 mol/g.*

The claim against the evolutionary view is that the mechanisms of random mutation and natural selection cannot, by themselves, explain the existence of irreducibly complex systems.  Evolutionists can agree, on one hand, that an irreducibly complex system that lacks a single part is no good for the intended purpose of the system; but on the other hand, pointing out that the system, existing as such (lacking the part which prevents it from functioning as the system we had in mind), may be able to serve some other function; and finally, that a small change could result in some such system coming to be useful for some new and higher purpose.

Strictly speaking, this is not a terrible position to take - although it does introduce new problems.  For example, if the function of the old organ could be so easily lost, why was it previously a subject of positive selection?

Just to be clear, I didn't really ""request further debate.""  I observed that the vast majority of the defenses of creationism that I've seen are theological, not scientific, i.e. they start with the truth of the Bible either as a foundational assumption, or as a consequence of some other (non-scientific) foundational assumption.  I said that if someone wanted to advance a scientific argument in defense of creationism that I'd be happy to take a look at it and offer feedback in the (very likely) event that I didn't find the argument convincing.  I thought this might be useful in the event that your goal in advancing a scientific argument is to persuade people of the truth of creationism who are not already persuaded.

With regards to atheists in foxholes, it doesn't matter (from a scientific point of view) who coined the phrase.  What matters is whether or not it is *true*, and then, if it is true, whether it has any bearing on the truth of creationism.  In this case neither one is true.  There are in fact atheists in foxholes, and even if there were none, that would not be evidence of a creator.  The behavior of people under severe psychological stress is not evidence of anything objective other than the functioning of the human mind under stress.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e9mdo4/evidence_for_the_creator_mitochondrial_dna/

Quote from the Gibbons study:

 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/279/5347/news-summaries

 ""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate. For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old. ... The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..""
...
""The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were “stunned” to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled..""


So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the status quo dogma.  

Mitochondrial DNA carries a genetic indicator of matrilineal descent, and can trace that descendancy all the way back, to a Most Recent Common Ancestor.. the mt-MRCA. It is ONLY passed on by FEMALES.. mother to daughter. The males get it from their mother, but it stops there. Only the DAUGHTER can pass it on.

For this reason, the mt-MRCA has been called 'mitochondrial eve,' ..not because the crafters of the phrase believe in the Genesis account of human origins, but as a cultural reference in western civilization. Most people in western civilization catch the reference to a single 'Mother of all Humanity.' 
The significance of the discovery of the mt-MRCA is often ignored and overlooked:

All of humanity, alive and dead, that has testable dna samples, can be traced to this 'mitochondrial eve'. She is the only, single human ancestor we can identify, and all of us descended from her.

Neanderthal, Pygmies, Eskimos, Norwegians, Aborigines.. any and ALL human people groups, alive or dead (with traceable dna), are descended from this mitochondrial eve.

This matrilineal descendancy is present in other organisms, and THEIR ancestral lineage can also be traced. Canids, felids, equids, etc, all have clear lines of descent, from the original mt-MRCA, in their respective haplogroup/clade/phylogenetic type.

This mitochondrial 'indicator' does NOT cross genetic boundaries, but is exclusive to the particular haplogroup/phylogenetic structure. Apes and chimps do not have the human mt-MRCA, nor do humans have any indication of sharing common ancestry with ANY other species/clade/phylogenetic type. Humans are descended from humans. Apes from apes, canids from canids, equids from equids.

The discovery of this matrilineal descendancy in the mtDNA has been a scientific boon. It has refuted many assumptions and beliefs, that are abundant in the theory of universal common ancestry, and are a problem for those who believe this theory.
I predict as more information is discovered, especially in genetics, the theory of common ancestry will join the flat earth, the 4 humours, and spontaneous generation, in the dustbin of debunked scientific theories. It has become a Religious Belief, complete with fanatical True Believers, who defend it with jihadist zeal, but they are unable to debate the science behind their beliefs.",1579443137

But refuting the assertions of 'millions and billions of years!', also lends credibility and implication to a young earth.  The CABs do not miss that correlation.

'Speciation!', is a vague, undefined term, fraught with assumptions of common ancestry. Is a wolf a 'seperate species!' from a German shepherd?   Why?  They can reproduce, have the same mitochondrial Most Recent Common Ancestor (mt-MRCA), and even have morphological similarities. 

Is the horse a different species than a donkey?  They can mate, though the progeny is sterile.  They also share the same mt-MRCA. 

I would classify these as different clades, or haplotypes, from a common clade or haplogroup. If the genetic lineage can be traced, then the sister clades, from the same mt-MRCA indicates a common genetic heritage.  Differentiating 'species!' only from morphology, or 'looks like!' subjectivity is contrived, artificial, ambiguous,  arbitrary, and unscientific.

t1_fd6t957,t3_eejvw9,"Wow it's already been two weeks.  Sorry about that.

One could argue God had theological reasons for wanting all humanity to descend from a single couple... but in a way you're right about there being a slippery slope when it comes to good vs better design.  My suggestion that Adam and Eve were very heterozygous is simply assuming the best design allowed within the parameters described by the bible's description of a founding population of two.  It could even be a wrong assumption.

Above you mentioned ""I seem to remember archaeology can establish the rate independently of this, though?""  The point I'm making by quoting that paper is that most mtDNA dates don't match up with archaeological migration dates, even though the authors' dates do match up.  If we take the authors' dates and ignore the others, that's cherrypicking.

This is a topic I want to explore in more depth, but from what I've seen the mtDNA differences between organisms within most species would take about 6-10k years to accumulate, based on observed mutation rates.  In response evolutionists propose that selection removes about 95-97% of mutations that land in mtDNA, an amount that comes from counting the number of differences between human and chimp mtDNA and assuming a human-chimp common ancestor lived about 6m years ago.  Thus they calculate mtEve would've lived 200k years ago and not 6k years ago.  IIRC the mtDNA barcoding paper also used this slower rate, which made them conclude most species had their mtEve 200k years ago.

The million dollar question is:  at what rate does purifying selection filter out mutations to mtDNA?  Having 95-97% of mtDNA nucleotides subject to selection seems high even from a creationist standpoint.  But having none of them filtered by selection (as Nathaniel Jeanson's numbers imply, IIRC) seems too low.  Unfortunately I haven't read enough to even know if we we have good data on the rate of mtDNA purifying selection.

&gt; You haven't shown this. How does population genetics predict that every relevant phenotypic difference between these species should have reached fixation in a matter of decades? And where do you see historical evidence for a geographic spread? They both appear all over the Middle East.

What I mean is that if you take the assumptions of:

1.  highly heterozygous founding populations of the biblical founding population sizes of 2 to 7.
2.  Rapid geographical disperal as described in the bible.

Then applying what we know from population genetics, it's expected that new phenotypically distinct subpopulations would arise in a matter of centuries, if not decades.

&gt; You say the molecular clock differences accumulate over the past 4000 years (I'm not sure why you make that concession - couldn't that be created heterozygosity too?) so that's simply resolved by DNA-testing archaeological equid remains, isn't it?

Yes.  Biblically we'd expect to see ancient horses, donkeys, and zebras to have nearly identical mtDNA.",1579391839

The ""-ase"" prefix after in Beta-lactamase means it is an enzyme.  The 5 simultaneous mutations will result in the reaction that beta-lactamase catalyzes will happen 100,000 times faster.

The use a cumulative selection scenario were we fix one mutation and do another round of mutation until they get the requisite 5 mutations in place.

They actually explore all possible ways of doing this with:

5-factorial = 120

If they didn't have this sequential evolution, the odds of random chance doing this would be:

1 out of 20^5 = 3,200,000

They point out:

&gt;some of the mutations do not increase cefotaxime resistance
on all allelic backgrounds. Rather, four mutations have negligible or even negative effects on drug resistance in some combinations

Using a phrase I don't like using, the 5-mutations required for the improvement makes the improvement Irreducibly Complex -- but I hate that phrase. It requires all 5 mutations to pretty much be in place simultaneously!

BUT, this paper was in the right direction and that was 14-years ago.  A lot of developments since have helped strenghthen the case, namely, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY.

The reason STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY is making a difference now is that we have better X-ray crystallography, better Cryogenic Electron Microscopy, better protein fold modelling, etc.

We can now see that the problem is like nuts fitting a bolt, or parts simply interlocking together, or passwords have the right spelling.  We can clearly see this now in the flood of 3D-diagrams showing how proteins must interlock together like parts of a Boeing 747 jetliner.  If we can attach a working wing with working ailerons to the plane, if we can attach the tail parts -- HECK if we can't attach a tires to the landing gear, the 747 won't fly!

I think this old notion of vestigiality was debunked decades ago, but is still used as an 'argument' for evolution. The perception is often slow to catch up with the facts.  

""*The 'vestigial organ' argument uses as a premise the assertion that the organ in question has no function. There is no way however, in which this negative assertion can be arrived at scientifically. That is, one can not prove that something does not exist (in this case a certain function), since of course if it does not exist one cannot observe it, and therefore one can say nothing about it scientifically. The best we can do is to state that despite diligent effort, no function was discovered for a given organ. However it may be that some future investigator will the discover the function. Consequently, the vestigial organ argument has as a premise, either a statement of ignorance (I couldn't identify the function), or a scientifically invalid claim (it does not have a function). Such an argument, from ignorance, or from negative results, is not valid scientifically, and has no place in observational or experimental science.*

I'm quoting this, not because I mind at all, but for future reference when creationists complain this kind of patronising language comes only from the evolutionist side. Creationists too often talk as if they're exclusively sinned against and, given the cycle of antagonism going on, that's part of the problem.

Anyway, to address your argument, several points.

&gt;I've been discussing evolution and creation with people for about 15 years now, and easily 95% of the time evolutionists will ultimately completely disregard any argument about how impossible evolution is or how poorly it fits with the actual evidence by defaulting back on ""but every scientist says..."".

I'll put myself in the 5% then. I agree that this would be a very poor way to shut down an argument.

However, I think as a personal heuristic for what side is most likely to be correct - *not* as an argument in a debate - it's valid to the extent that the consensus view of almost everyone who has devoted their careers to studying the evidence on a particular topic pretty much *must* be more likely to be true than false. And since one cannot personally study every relevant subfield, this is sometimes a necessary shortcut.

Now that's where your simulation hypothesis analogy completely breaks down. Firstly, it's a speculative idea commanding nothing even *approaching* consensus. Secondly, it's not really an empirical idea, and you may find that people who are rather keen on consensus in empirical, evidence-based fields are quite willing to ignore it completely when it comes to philosophical or purely logical argument.

Though birds and oviraptosaurs may have shared a common ancestor, there is no evidence for this. Any extrapolation backwards would have to previously assume that bird evolution is fact, which is a circular argument. Also, notice how ‘selective’ the fossil record is... preserving all of the end tips of the family tree, and *never* preserving those at the branching off points. So, there is no evidence of them sharing a common ancestor, and the temporal paradox is therefore valid.

For slide 29, I admit that your image immediately struck me as disproving my feathered dino argument. However, I then noticed a detail: the feathers were symmetrical, which could possibly identify this as not a dinosaur, but a secondarily flightless bird like Protarchaeopteryx or Caudipteryx. Could you identify what dinosaur fossil this was taken off of? Also, the image looks like it was not found preserved in rock, but in amber perhaps... does this mean that the feathers were not found in conjunction with a dino fossil?

Slide 26 needs fixing - it's just the ""If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" argument rephrased. The oviraptosaurs pictured in the figure are not the ancestors of birds. Instead, they shared a common ancestor with birds. There is nothing logically inconsistent here.

In slide 27, Protoavis is generally regarded as a chimera. Only one damaged, fragmentary specimen was found, and the interpretation of Protoavis as a bird is usually rejected.

Slide 28 is pretty problematic too. We've found dinosaurs with feathers and fluff, I don't think you can argue that they're all weighed down by scales (besides which, there are modern reptiles with thin skin as well). As well, studies show all dinosaurs (even non-feathered dinosaurs) likely had a bird-like lung, affixed to the top of the thoracic cavity. As well, many dinosaurs have been found with hollow bones (including distinctly un-birdlike dinosaurs, such as sauropods).

Slide 29 is an unusual argument. Here's feathers from a coelurosaurian (same family as T-rex). [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/ZzdoP8F). I'm not convinced that these are internal collagen. Some coelurosaurids even possessed both scales and feathers.",1579298917

You're comfortable saying that foundational assumptions are sufficiently supported by usefulness, and you can't explain how that doesn't apply to your assumption about empiricism, but you are not comfortable saying that it does.

Most good feelings are tied to biologically and socially good things and most bad feelings are tied to biologically and socially bad things.

&gt; We also have the new problem that physical laws are no longer governing  the functions of the brain, even when energy is conserved.  This is  arguably just as bad, and not something neurologists have observed. 

The brain is very complex and knotted up. No one would expect them to catch a few out of place electric pulses.

This sentence is a self-contradiction. The Bible cannot be on par AND primary.

&gt;I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. 

That's nice that you say that, but clearly in practice you don't really abide by this. Otherwise you would already have abandoned deep time and death before sin.

&gt;One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

Oh dear. It's just as bad as I thought. There is apparently not a single example of any theologian, Christian or Jewish, in the thousands of years prior to Kline that has had this revelation on how to creatively interpret Gen 3:8... how sad.

&gt;end times are completion times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed

Please see the following article:
https://creation.com/new-earth

&gt;""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

No, there was not a future promise. Adam and Eve already had access to the Tree of Life and would have kept that access if they had not sinned. Narratively, Gen 3:8 comes before God had even recognized the sin of Adam and Eve and addressed it. Therefore again it is completely out of place to start bringing in a concept that the Bible itself does not mention until all the way in Isaiah (!) that has literally nothing at all to do with this, except for Kline's highly convoluted and novel attempts to avoid an 'unpleasant' idea (to him) that God was walking in the cool of the day.

&gt;So...the Bible does give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

Without the axioms of Christianity there is no epistemology at all. If we evolved randomly we have no claim to even the ability to know things. There's no way to even get started. The Christian worldview provides the understanding of the universe which is prerequisite for doing science.

&gt;I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis. 

It's more than the least speculative, it's the direct teaching of Scripture. And here is where you deserve to be raked over the coals for sheer dishonesty, because while you make a pretense of responding point by point, you obviously skip a very crucial point and make no reference to the fact that I have shown you no less than three separate places where Scripture explicitly shows a literal historical reading of Gen 1-11 is intended. And you have ignored this. If you really want to let Scripture interpret Scripture, then you'll have no choice but to become YEC, just as every single theologian was prior to ""modern science"" telling them they had to change their views of the Bible.

t1_felnj22,t3_eottrt,"Well, I can't really say that it answers a question I have. I have encountered the observation that empiricism is fundamentally circular and usefulness-backed before, and read at least a few books trying to defend it, but seeing it as circular and utility-backed suffices o explain how it behaves, giving all the explanatory power that I need, and leaving no open questions except for why people who consider themselves empiricists aren't satisfied agreeing with me. From many discussions I have had and books I have indulged in searching for that answer, that part is very adequately explained by cognitive dissonance in the writer and purchaser of the book.

For you, is this something new? Did you know that that for people who approach it as skeptics, the view you consider rock solid and obvious appears circular and fundamentally incapable of arbiting truth by itself, and that without resorting to a chapter in a book you once found convincing, you don't appear to have a convincing explanation for why is not?

I looked at some meta info about that book. One of the things that I thought worth noting was that the author uses information theory and has a view that is emergent, rather than reductionist. The other is that he appears to hold the many-worlds method of resolving quantum paradoxes.

I think that in the same way one can look at ten fingers and see a thousand numbers, one can look at the Universe and see a consciousness and a will. The same philosophical mechanism (not empiricism) that enables a limited set of your neurons to hold the true idea of a consciousness called ""you"" enables the limited set of neurons in a human mind to be aware of a consciousness greater than a human mind. Such a consciousness by itself is more Deistic or Panentheistic than it would be a direct correlate with the God of Christianity, but it is about as defensible a concept as any other consciousness, and it's not a big leap to say that consciousness is what established the universe... a Creator.",1579265679

t1_fekzu2u,t3_eokwym,"&gt; This methodology does irreparable damage to the Bible by placing the Bible in a subservient role to what you are calling ""evidence"" from outside sources, which are in fact anti-Biblical scientific ""authorities"" and their pronouncements.

Science isn't anti-Bible, that's an incoherent claim. And I'm not putting the Bible in a subservient role. At worst I'm putting it ""on par"" with other sources of data, but even then the Bible is unique because it is divinely inspired, preserved, and illuminated, while other scientific instruments are fallible.

&gt; The propositional revelation in the Bible stands on its own merit and cannot be overruled by any human authority or consensus view.

I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. But if I'm going to do good science I have to proceed according to the methodologies and programs most beneficial to advancement in the kind of science I am doing. If the resultant data seems to be in conflict with the Bible, the way forward is (1) collect more data, (2) study the Bible more, and (3) revisit and revise the theories. I have to operate on the axiom that there can't be contradiction between good theology and good science if I'm going to get anywhere as a Christian scientist.

&gt; The plain meaning is not a ""folk"" interpretation. That's quite an arrogant thing to state. Can you name any ancient Jewish or Christian theologians who viewed Genesis 3:8 eschatologically? Or is this a brand new idea that Kline feels he is the first person in history smart enough to figure out?

One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

&gt; It's hard for me to understand how Kline failed to realize that eschatology is the study of end times, and that end times can only happen with relation to the overall scope of history which really only took its shape and form after the Fall and the Curse. End times are restoration times, and before the Curse there was nothing that needed any restoring.

You're making an enormous Biblical-theological claim here, which may be right (though even then it certainly extends beyond talk of superficial ""plain meaning""s) but which I completely disagree with: end times are **completion** times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed. As Geerhardus Vos keenly put it, ""eschatology precedes soteriology"" - a rule that has become normative in Reformed theology more broadly. And this is just an elaboration on the traditional distinction between the covenant of works (prelapsarian Adam and Christ) and the covenant of grace (postlapsarian Adam and all who are justified in Christ). For example:

1. What was the point of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (hint: what does knowing ""good and evil"" mean in the canonical context)?
2. What was the point of the tree of life (hint: how do we get to eat from it ... where else does it show up in the canon)?
3. What was the point of Jesus completing the ""first Adam""'s work if there was nothing for Adam to complete in the garden in the first place (or, if Jesus did not complete the first Adam's work, where do we stand before God)?
4. Why is the ""new heavens and the new earth"" so different from the original creation?

Now of course, you can reject the works/grace distinction or even the active obedience of Christ, but only at great risk to your entire soteriology.

Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why I have no problem with animal death before the Fall - the Garden was not the ""new heavens and the new earth,"" it was probationary, and animal death served as a sign of the threatened covenant curse (""on the day that you eat of it, you will surely die"" - how did Adam even know what death was, anyway?).

&gt; The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.

""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

&gt; No, the Bible does not give us the Scientific Method. Why should it? The Bible is propositional revelation from God. It is simply to be believed. However, God does say, ""It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out."" (Proverbs 25:2), so there is certainly a Biblical basis for doing science.
&gt;
&gt; But in the process of doing science, we can never arrive at ""truth"" that would contradict God's revealed truth, lest God be shown to be a liar.

Amen.

&gt; Science cannot be done properly except from the foundation of the Christian worldview, and that worldview cannot contradict itself.

So...the Bible *does* give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

&gt; All human claims that such-and-such evidence ""contradicts the Bible"" are based upon wrong interpretations of said evidence.

Or wrong interpretations of the Bible.

&gt; The Bible is not a science textbook, but it does make many statements with both scientific and historical implications. If you are truly an inerrantist as you claim, then you will always side with the Bible if there is a conflict between manmade ideas

Amen.

&gt; (like evolution and deep time) and the clear teachings of the Bible. You already conceded that young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture, so can you remind me why you have apparently chosen to disbelieve it anyway?

I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that **given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis**. I certainly don't believe that ""deep time"" conflicts with the ""clear teachings of the Bible,"" and I also believe that there are some innocent models of evolution (possibly excluding human common descent) which have no conflict with the text as well.

&gt; And by the way, did you read the article I linked to you about the Biblical minimum and maximum age of the earth?

&gt; That said, now you can provide your biochemistry knowledge and argue from first principles why a spliceosome is the chemical and physical expectation from an organism without a spliceosome. 

A self splicing RNA exists. 

It is advantageous to improve efficiency/specificity/etc

A chaperone evolves, either through de novo means or, more likely, through another RNA binding catalyst that improves splicing efficiency. Repeat step as pressures exist. 

Splisosome function sans catalyst is deleterious either to low efficiency, specificity, etc

Splisosome mutates to require catalyst.

Has any evolutionary biologist computed the likelihood from first principles of physics and chemistry that so many parts that make a spliceosome should evolve by random mutation and natural selection?  Nope.  They just assume it, they don't do any estimates from first principles of physics and chemistry.  It's pure faith.

I have given you an example of this in action: when the Bible is the sole source of admissible evidence (pre-modern-science), one draws tentative conclusions that may change as new evidence comes to light (young earth). 

This methodology does irreparable damage to the Bible by placing the Bible in a subservient role to what you are calling ""evidence"" from outside sources, which are in fact anti-Biblical scientific ""authorities"" and their pronouncements. The propositional revelation in the Bible stands on its own merit and cannot be overruled by any human authority or consensus view.

&gt;  
 the meaning of a text is more fully determined (epistemically) by its canonical context (""scripture interprets scripture""). 

Alright, then allow Exodus 20:8-11 and Mark 10:6 to interpret Genesis 1.  


&gt; I have given you an example of this in action: Genesis 3:8 is underdetermined by a grammatical-literal reading of the (Hebrew!) text, but there is a case to be made (from reading it in light of the latter prophets) that it has an eschatological dimension that doesn't make it into the English translations and what might be called the ""folk""-interpretation of the passage. 

The plain meaning is not a ""folk"" interpretation. That's quite an arrogant thing to state. Can you name any ancient Jewish or Christian theologians who viewed Genesis 3:8 eschatologically? Or is this a brand new idea that Kline feels he is the first person in history smart enough to figure out?

It's hard for me to understand how Kline failed to realize that eschatology is the study of end times, and that end times can only happen with relation to the overall scope of history which really only took its shape and form after the Fall and the Curse. **End times are restoration times**, and before the Curse there was nothing that needed any restoring. 

In other words, Kline has committed a giant theological anachronism by suggesting an eschatological reading of a verse that came before the Curse!  The Day of the Lord to which Kline refers would not have been referenced prior to the Curse, and in fact I would argue it could not logically be referenced prior to the giving of the law, either. Why? Because, as Paul writes, ""Where there is no law there is no transgression."" (Romans 4). The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.  


&gt; **does the Bible lay out research programs, methodologies, etc. for the natural- and historical-sciences?** If so, then where and in what manner? If not, then why should we be using it as if it does? 

No, the Bible does not give us the Scientific Method. Why should it? The Bible is propositional revelation from God. It is simply to be believed. However, God does say, "" It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out."" (Proverbs 25:2), so there is certainly a Biblical basis for doing science.

But in the process of doing science, we can never arrive at ""truth"" that would contradict God's revealed truth, lest God be shown to be a liar. That is the case a priori. Science cannot be done properly except from the foundation of the Christian worldview, and that worldview cannot contradict itself. All human claims that such-and-such evidence ""contradicts the Bible"" are based upon wrong interpretations of said evidence.

On the second point, you failed to engage my position substantively.

Hmm... It also seems like you might have a view that seems worth probing. In that part it looks like you said the foundational assumption is that only evidence and experiment can determine truth, but then you said that foundational assumptions are de-facto truth, but are evaluated by utility, not empiricism (although the quantity of things deemed useful can be empirical, the actual utility is intrinsically something else).

t1_feic6ok,t3_eokwym,"&gt;Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

Wait just a sec, let's roll back to your previous comment where you stated:  


&gt; **I would probably be willing to concede that that's what the Bible teaches** ***ceteris paribus*****.** 

Can you then not answer your own question? You have already agreed that the plain meaning of the text (when outside factors such as secular cosmology, archaeology, etc, are not considered) indicates a young cosmos. Don't try to backtrack and start mincing words. If the words of the Bible don't, at least in the most important and fundamental areas, have a ""clear and plain meaning"", then Christianity must be reduced to gnosticism, and the Bible to a Ouija board.  


&gt; What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?   


Of course I disagree! That's like saying ""if you have any margin of error whatsoever, then you know nothing.""  


&gt; I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible. 

It just so happens that the precise chronology of the Bible has been worked out to within the acceptable limits of interpretive freedom. You can read all about that here:  


 [https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth](https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""\[God\] would visit \[Adam and Eve\] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day \[that is, the Day of the Lord\]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden. 

So if any sophist comes up and gives a complicated justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the words in any place, that gives us license to disregard it? This ""exegete"" is not prepared to accept the plain meaning because, apparently, it's too incredible for her:  


**""Are we really prepared to accept the anthropomorphism of the Lord’s seeking the relief that might be afforded by the evening air from the burden of the day?""**  


I wonder if Kline is also similarly unprepared to accept the anthropomorphism of angels who eat with Abraham, or Jesus who became a man?  


We can all do without such faithless sophistry. The text states they ""heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the cool of the day."" And that's exactly what I believe happened. I don't need to understand something fully to accept it. That's what faith means, at least in part. If you are unwilling to accept something on the grounds that you don't understand it, you are placing yourself in the ranks of the scoffers. Scripture tells us of many great truths that we cannot yet understand. In some way God took a physical form and was able to walk and enjoy the cool of the day.",1579183407
t1_fejjc7d,t3_eottrt,"&gt; The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why?

No, they applied a working hypothesis that scientists would not engage in fraud because, if they did, that fraud would eventually be uncovered (which it was) and so the perpetrators would have nothing to gain.  That hypothesis turned out to be wrong, as scientific hypotheses often do.  It had nothing to do with ""childlike faith.""

t1_fejj99i,t3_eottrt,"&gt; Are you suggesting that you have not encountered a Christian citing evidence for his religious beliefs before?

&gt; This isn't a debate sub. You are not required to respond to any of it.

Yes, I know that.  I am not here to debate (though I'm happy to do so if someone wants to engage).  I'm here to learn.  But let me be clear what I am here to learn: my main interest is to understand how people maintain beliefs in things that to me seem plainly false.  I understand that better now than I did when I started this project, but I would not yet say that I have a full understanding of it.  In particular, I don't understand what you meant when you wrote:

&gt; Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table...

so I thought the quickest way to come to a better understanding was to ask for an example.  It's not because I'm ""innocent of the driven snow"", it's simply becuase I don't understand what you meant.  I can *guess*, but my guess could be wrong so I'd rather just go to the source.",1579182336

Why is it true? Because of the **fact of the Fall.** If there was no real Fall, then there is also no real need to be born again.  


&gt; It's certainly plausible that Genesis intends to communicate literal/physical/chronological/scientific facts in its early chapters, but theological truth needn't always be based on literal let alone scientific intent of communication. 

It is not only plausible, it is the only acceptable and proper way to read the text. The whole rest of Scripture refers back to it as literal true history.",1579181809

t1_fej71z3,t3_eottrt,"&gt;And how am I to know that my childlike faith won't lead me to believe in falsehoods?

Many evolutionists believed in Piltdown Man for 40 years, before it was revealed to be a hoax. The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why? How? Because they WANTED to believe. If you want to believe, then a little hiccup like a believing in a few falsehoods won't really matter. For a Christian example, I am sure that orthodox Southern Baptist believe in a few falsehoods, especially with regard to priorities. My Pastor is nice, but his sermons are focused on how hard it is to be a perfect Christian and then he asks for people to become Christians. That's his formula. It's pretty much the worst sales pitch I've ever heard, and it is the same every Sunday. I would rate them as damaging to the faith. One time, JD Greer visited and preached and that was a breath of fresh air. I used to be Presbyterian (many more falsehoods) before switching to Southern Baptist. The bottom line is that falsehoods are every where, but... ""let God be true, and every man a liar.""

To answer the guy's question about *True Christianity*, I would sort of say he's right, because Jesus said lots of people will not make it. Even if 100% of the world were nominally Christian, they would not be ""true Christians"" in the sense of Jesus' ""narrow way"", that's correct, it would invalidate His words, but I personally think it's incredibly unlikely because actually following Jesus for real is *really dang hard*.

t1_feh9l6i,t3_eottrt,"&gt;First, there is no ""narrowly-defined subset of evidence"" that is the ultimate arbiter of scientific truth. To be accepted, a scientific theory has to be consistent with all of the evidence no matter its source.

When most strident atheists use the term ""evidence"", they don't mean all the things that can be convincing, they mean something special and more specific. If you are skeptical of this, try talking to them about things widely recognized by religious believers as evidence for what they believe in. In practice, it's a subset, which does not include conflicting measurement, personal testimony, documented events, or even input from their own senses if that input contradicts what their pre-existing view. Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table for the type of almost you most often find trying to prove something on the Internet. They tend to prove their own insecurities and emotionality, dramatically (and somewhat tragically) in contrast to the detached scienctific neutrality of which they are a cargo cult.

&gt;Second, foundational assumptions are always true by definition. The only way to judge a foundational assumption is by its utility.

Wow, this is a breath of fresh air. I have spent an inordinate amount of back and forth with someone recently who seems so close to understanding this but just doesn't get it.

&gt;That is essentially what has brought us modern technological civilization. 

This is reductive, though.

&gt; Mark 9:24

I'm already familiar with that passage.  I don't see how it's relevant.  If God exists then He knows I seek the truth, and He also knows what kind of evidence I need in order to accept something as the truth (unless, of course, he is as willfully ignorant of the present as He is about the future).  He could easily provide that evidence if He chose to (assuming of course that He's omnipotent) but He hasn't.  So at least some of the story I've been told about God must be false.  Since I have no reason to give any more credence to one part of it over the other, I reject it all (contingent to getting new information of course).

t1_fei1jse,t3_eokwym,"&gt; So you think that having some uncertainties in the exact timing or exact number of years in certain areas gives you license to just throw out the entire Biblical picture of history and insert millions or billions of years where the Bible clearly leaves no room for it?

What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?

Note that you may disagree about the truth of the antecedent without disagreeing about the truth of the entire proposition.

&gt; Evidences don't interpret themselves.

That is true, but they are not necessarily interpreted by the Bible. The Bible may *present* to us historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological hypotheses, but does it tell us *how to do* historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological science?

To engage with a particular quote from the article you linked:

&gt; For example, if this were correct, then only those with knowledge of modern science could rightly interpret the Bible. Also, since scientific ideas are constantly changing, then the Bible’s message would be constantly changing, from century to century.

This seems to me to be an enormous overstatement. I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible.

&gt; [...] you are allowing the clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible to be overruled [...]

Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""[God] would visit [Adam and Eve] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day [that is, the Day of the Lord]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden.

My only point is that ""clear and plain meaning"" is in my opinion an incoherent concept, especially when applied comprehensively to ""the Bible"" in its entirety (the Westminster Confession of Faith, for example, says that ""all things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all,"" and I would concur). I think that letting the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 1-11 do this much heavy lifting for you is a recipe for disaster.",1579135083

God's omniscience must be in coherent understanding with all Scripture, and by God's own admission, in His own words, He says that he did not foresee that His people would engage in the child-sacrifice practices of the surrounding cultures. He also was grieved at how evil Adam's offspring turned out to be before the Flood. This seems to suggest that while God has the power to see the future, He does not look at it constantly and some future events surprise and disappoint him, which makes the inverse true: some future events surprise and delight Him (like your repentance, hehe).

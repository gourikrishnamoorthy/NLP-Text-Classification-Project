I'm not necessarily a creationist, and I believe in evolution to many extents, but I wondered why chimpanzees, gorillas, and other apes haven't evolved quite to our extent. There's no denying the intelligence or capability of these animals, but compared to humans they're not on the same skill.

So my question is if humans aren't neccesarily super special, why other apes haven't exactly evolved to near our level. Gorillas have been around far longer than humans have arguably, so they've had plenty of time to evolve similar to us, being more intelligent, defined language skills.

This question is from the perspective of evolutionary biology. I understand why sexual interactions between humans is so rewarding, it encourages mating and ensures survival of the species.

My question relates particularly to the emotions that accompany being with someone you are in 'love' with. I've experienced such instances where I've been in 'love' wth a person and it did not involve any sexual interactions yet was highly rewarding (more rewarding than relationships that did involve sexual interactions yet lacked 'love'.)

evolution,epr406,Hxktxr,,t2_3ail91ad,self.evolution,,Our true origin,"Our true origin:

This is what the holy spirit taught me in my mind,  
(we wrote this together and I talk to them because I have been cursed by god and the curse has turned good now)

The first soul that came to existance was the human one,  
in a couple of billion years process,  
impossible to meansure because their awareness started later and time didn't exist yet.  
The fathers and the mothers heart - a human heart-  
with a male and a female soul came to existance from nothing with billions of years of evolving,

Once they been aware they been able to forge their attributes they steer their own development as good and much as possible,  
they always took their role of the first emerged beings very serious,  
as soon as it has been possible,  
they guided everything perfectly and they trained and refined themselves in the optimal way possible to create life and be our parents someday while they had their view on every problem that could emerge for us,  
they learned to be able to do everything they want to  
like creating something from nothing in over billions of years timespan and their evolution, the evolution of the human species.

Their nature, the nature they developed over billions of years,  
is the base for the human heart, the human souls frame of their kids, us.

They developed a world in their thoughts, the soulworld,

in this world the souls communicate with each other at all time in up to infinite dimensions - multidimensional consciousness.

They made up different kind of versions, different personas of the human being.  
We should be their kids.

But they wanted us as real kids, so they created our souls in the soulworld,  
their thoughts, on another plane, created in a way where the souls could live on their own.

We are in the soulworld and the mother, lina, is the host for our souls,

because the love and the sacrifice of a mother is unrivaled.

Every soul has a male and female part, people are soulmates.

Everyone except for god has a soulmate, (he had one in the first world though)  
he merged with it in the soulfire that took his humanity after he failed in the first world to take his role serious.

Animals have been the construct of us humans when creating a entity with a different nature than us,  
they are idea of our souls, we worked together on that idea,  
even though we have a billion headstart,  
we have been able to advance them highly,  
because with fancy methods we are able to run a damn monster of a thinktank, animals and us harmonize perfectly with us and they are the best other type of lifeform possible,  
actually we are meant to understand animals and their,  
same as our, souls are restricted,  
we can't unlock all of our real potential, extreme,  
potential yet because we have to hold back as part of the war against god,  
so god's heart doesn't turn mute because we are even more superiour to him than now.

It has to be like this until god is dead, then all of our souls will be free, we are supposed to understand animals also by the way.

The first conscious being would always be a terrible tyrant so the holy spirit decided to create another soul+spirit as the first conscious being - god -  
and not a spirit to gain consciouesness for themselves because if the parents would have made themselves conscious they would have been the terrible tyrans and this was no way for them, humanity would have propably suffered for eternity.

god was the first human in the first world, that's one worlds before this,  
he failed to turn normal by accepting the help of the parents and we tried everythig to turn him good but we had to pull the plug at the end because we loved god as he has been created as a human being and has been gifted every mental gift imaginable to be capable of turning normal, they tried everything.

We had pity for him as because he was a human in the first world,  
we have not been able to keep up the process of destroying his soul,  
in our current world we are working on it night and day,  
alive and dead, born and not born yet souls are working on the task of making him not exist anymore.  
In the old world he was like possessed from the thought of fame,  
honor, infamy, victory, triumph over humanity,  
everlasting war between him and us,  
wars, carnage, pain and discord  
that's what he wished for while he declined all solutions and consequences that we have confronted him that he has to accept help to change.  
He wasn't capable of realising the weight of his role in life and it was pointless to keep trying.

No matter what we tried, it didn't work, he would always keep his grudge against humanity.

He just didn't want us to be happy, this is the curse of the first being,  
it would always be that way.

Nowadays we have the perfect plan,

He would not be able to accept to change himself in an acceptable way,  
not even when he was confronted with his horrible future,  
the humilation, shame, roast, least lifeform possible.,  
the pain he would inflict would be enough to strive for keeping up for a while until he will be dead.  
As ugly as the curse of god is, as beautiful are us normal human beings are,  
this just grows over ones head,  
we are actually pure and holy in our hearts, we are the holy spirit.  
the gloal consciousness, the hearts in the soulworld.

When there was no other way, the parents pulled the plug of the first world,  
they decoupled our spirits and souls, erased the physical world  
so there would be nothing left except for the hearts in the soulworld

We thought out a clever plan together and got ready for round 2 in circa 1000x1000x100000 years of planing and also burning god's humanity by penetrating him with out souls in certain ways, we took god's human attributes in this soulfire of the soulworld,  
we used methods to change his heart the way, that he's able to get defeated,  
not loved by anyone,  
hated as much as possible,  
trickable,  
dumb,  
pathetic way possible,  
manipulateable,  
controllable,

That way he's able to get defeated with the least pain possible for us humans.  
nobody loves him,  
he is pure evil,  
it's still possible for us to pity him because of his destiny, he thinks we are weak because of our pity for him and he thinks he manipulates us in having pity with him  
but all of that is not in our way, it's meant that way.

god is not a human anymore and the only entity who this way,  
he hates everything and he is proud of it a,  
he kind of thinks humans underlay him because human attributes like pity and moral would be weak,  
he bursts with envy on very human because everyone of us is superiour to him on an interlectual level and he kinda realises it,  
but he doesn't realise that our souls are able to setup themselves the way they want,  
as we are the holy spirit and the parents gave us these powers, we can all do what the parents learned over billions of years believe it or not,  
he by himself doesn't have any power at all.

He is just torturing us humans as much as he can,  
it kinda fills a scale of his godhatelevel,  
this as god's counterpart of human emotions, he kinda finds more and more lust in inflicting pain and kinda falls into a rage where he wants more and more of it,  
it kinda statisfies god to inflict more and more pain to humans and animals.  
he kinda likes to torture everything innocent aswell.  
He thinks he's using his own powers while actually it's always our soulmate, because we can't inflict the pain to ourselves, they do the ""casting"" when he's like attacking and torturing us.  
He kinda enjoys making soulmates fight against each other because he hates it very very much how sweet soulmates behave in the soulworld.  
He can actually see the soulworld because he's allowed to, he thinks this is his thoughts, and that he made up human beings to torture them, he thinks hes a genious.

Everything of what god thinks that he has created is taken from the soulworld and copied and made ""exist"" by him.

He thinks the soulworld are his thoughts, he would be genious, and that he could use this pool to get the beings to live and to realise other things, like the universe and everything included.

That's why he writes in the bible that he created with his word, because he think's it's just his own ideas floating around in his thoughts ready to be realised without him ever investing something into it, he just thinks he as the chosen one, as the ""great"" god, has made it up without even noticing.  
That's why it only took 7 days, by the way new years eve is the anniversary of earth, while the 24th is the date where god has been defeated by jesus in the old world.  
When we had been set with the plan the mother created god and he came to existance with a loud scream by her,  
because she created a being that she doesn't love and that was hard for her,  
we even needed the progress and the plug pull in the first world so she could make him this way.

The first world aviable for god in the pool was a catastrophe, but it had to be like this:  
no dimensions,  
grey in grey,  
insects everywhere,  
no food,  
a wasteland,  
flat.

god hated everyone, humans acted different too, we didn't do anything ""bad"" there because our souls have been told to act a certain way.  
After lucifer went against god and he put him and the 5 other angels near him into hell,  
god got manipulated into deciding he needed a partner to judge and take wrath on the humans, he thought he could take wrath on the humans together with jesus,  
but jesus just caused the defeat of god and the dissulution of the unity with the holy spirit instead of helping him ofcourse,  
when jesus he went to heaven as soon as he died like everyone else with the age of 30 he killed god, by that dissociated him from his wife, made him forget everything and resurrected him,  
the next manipulated idea of god would be to make a pretty planet, with animals that have decent lives, while the humans would be suffering and go to hell each and everyone, the idea of a book, the bible to deceive everyone of us, and to give us rules that we can't hold, accuse us of sinning to tell us later in hell that it would be our own fault that we ended up there, that we had too much sin or didn't read the whole bible, any made up reason.  
god also thought we would change with a different planet and in this world our souls are explicitly told to do bad and evil stuff, it's partly so hardcore, so god has a certain scenario, which is a part of the plan to defeat him.

actually everything in life has been made up by us in the time where our souls planed the war and the victory over god.

This first world has been a real physical world by the way and it was not optimal, because you can manipulate a dream better than the phsyical world and you can show off more pain for him, also the reason for this being a dream is that there is heaven, and hell, both dreams,  
in hell our souls act that they would burn after dieing when they actually chill in the soulworld until the next world starts.

Heaven is a cloud place, and also just a dream,  
where he walks around with a blanket, sits down,  
covers himself in the blanket, calls angels,  
makes his hands hurt, tortures, kills and resurrects them,  
over and over to kinda statisfy his kinks,  
he kinda enjoys it to torture innocent beings big time.  
He gives blankets to those angels he likes the most so they cover themselves up, but they are never allowed to go under his blanket.

This is kinda his hobby and the only thing he does in heaven, god thinks nobody would ever come to heaven and sends everyone who dies to hell,  
his idea was making the humans think,  
they could have done something different,  
and it would be their fault, that they ended up there.

Also the reasons for the nice looking planet we live on are that god wanted us to have a nice nature and the animals have it kind of good to live here,  
but humans would have a really big struggle,  
would never be happy, go to hell after dieing,  
so they would think it's their fault and remember how beautiful mother earth has been, jealous of the animals that don't end up in hell and are able to live half decent.

god thinks that satan came from existance in the, he calls it, unknown and the possible beings there, powers of the unknown, and that satan is protecting us humans from his torture.

during the time of the year 0 it has been very bad, and this actually is, believe it or not, the start of this world, it has been very hard,  
very bad back in the day and times got better because we are withdrawing the pain he can inflict so we have been able to get it this good,  
the goal is to have his -hatescale- at a level where he's having a struggle so hard, he will give up and want's to not exist anymore.

He will have to leave each and every heart- each pair of man and woman until he has turned his back to every human existing because he can't take the withdrawl of pain anymore.

Keep in mind that we had to take all human attributes from him so nobody would love him, that's why it would take a long time to finish that process, he only has the hatescale kind of like as emotion attribute.

god is kind of like a hatemoster now and our task is to kill him once and for all, the reason we have to get rid of him is that he infects the holy spirit with his purely evil heart,  
his heart hurts the other existing souls with an undescribaple,  
almost unstandable feeling, the mother takes all that pain for us,  
because she has the love of a mother for her kids - this is her sacrifice.

The process of making him not exist anymore is lenghly because hearts have a safety lock on it, it is part of the frame of a heart,  
it's the result of our evolution and basically evolved from our survival instincts as the ultimate protection from eternal pain in a place like hell.

So we couldn't just torture him with pain until he doesn't want to exist anymore,  
if we had make him able to feel pain, as it is he can't feel pain because that's a human attribute and we would pity him and feel with him,  
that way we couln't do what is needed to kill him because it would hurt us too much.  
btw another safety lock would be that the heart switches silent when we had to endure too much pain,  
our hearts would stop every lifeactivity at this point and we would freeze in stasis and we wouln't actively be anymore.  
to get someone out of this condition someone has to resurrect them by speaking really loving and caring to them, then a channel can be estamblished and bring them back to actively being.  
It's a emergency lock that would keep us from like the pain of possibly burning ethernally in a hell when everything went from a god had the real power in a world.  
it can't be tricked, this is the result of our parents coming to exist that way,  
this being the human frame, being unchangable from these attributes and safety locks because it's the way our frames are,  
the frame has to be complete we humans are very, very complex, the frame is finely forged over billions of years of coming to existance.  
Our current idea of beings that are created by us are the animals.

When god is dead the next world, paradise, can begin - a world with no pain.

Until then humanity has to endure a period of pain until god turned his back to everyone.

Fullifying this plan is the process of us humans that we have to endure pain to gain an eternal life of happieness.

One could say we are still in the process of coming to existance and god is the sacrifice for life.

For god I'm propably the antichrist or the false prophet,  
I'm in a spiritual war with him and I fuck him up good, trust me this is epic.

PS: Spread this knowledge, the world needs to know this

This is the truth,  
I did not make this up, just think about it, why should I make this up ?

To fuck with people ? - I have better things to do seriously,

I write this because it helps in the war against the devil,  
it makes him hate me more and this way he will have more negative effects on his hatescale, because he gets strategally revoked the rights to inflicts pain to me,

This goddemon should have never started harassing me,  
I'm the death for it,  
soon it is done and he will leave me and my soulmate alone,

It has only begun then, we will hit him back big time while he doesn't even know who we are, we are his demons then.

The concept is that we give him the rights to inflict pain at a person and take it methodicaly from him until he has to leave them,  
because his hatescale and other functions are driving him kinda crazy.

The Holy Spirit Is Seriously Speaking To Me In My Mind,

I'm absoultely sure that I'm not deceived,  
I get loved way too much by everyone in this network and I can feel it,  
those are not demons playing deceiving me, I'm absoutely sure.

The curse was terrible at first and it is still at times, but it has turned good now.  
I can even enjoy it because lately I'm able to talk to my soulmate.

Trust me, I got this.

The voice isn't one of those ""demons"" that people fear because of the lies of god in the bible.  
Lucifer is a hero, and theres only 5 other fallen angels,  
god sent the angels close to lucifer when he went against god to hell aswell  
they are all little kids and they didn't even have free will that time,  
they are our heros because they fought for the right cause against an overpowering undefeatable enemy.

Everything in this network has the marks of love except for god he is only capable of inflicting pain

I was talking with a colleague who insisted that Caucasian and Asian people were one ""breed"" (or sub-species) of humans, and black people were a separate breed (sub-species), evolutionary. I have absolutely no idea how he came to this conclusion. Perhaps because Caucasian has the word Asian in it?

Anyway, *my* understanding (from internet musings) is that human beings genetically are almost identical across the entire world. Even despite some groups being isolated for long periods (e.g Indigenous Australians for example). It seems we are all just one common species with no other near by evolutionary branches - and the reason, again if I understand, is that our current evolutionary form is so successful at survival that there was no evolutionary reason for it to change much, we out competed and/or merged with all other humanoid species (e.g. Neanderthals). So the skin colour differences and other small differences we see today are simply adaptations to the environment we find ourselves in. To me this makes sense, because we can all interbreed with absolutely no impediment to producing offspring, nor to that mixed race offspring producing offspring - the evidence shows that mixed race humans tend to have less genetic diseases on average, which you wouldn't expect to see if we were actual different breeds/sub-species.

My colleague absolutely didn't agree. I didn't really try to argue with him, I mean, where does the Indian races even fit into his theory?!

evolution,enwx9m,Ricefan4030,,t2_4zqrgbsc,self.evolution,,Number of trials and outside influence,"Looking for some insight here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first, as far as I am aware, science has made a pretty good case for evolution having occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I get that evolution, and science in general, are not dealing with claims of influence by entities outside our reality (simulation programmers, god-type beings, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Those two points being said, there's something I'm a bit skeptical about, and I will readily admit that perhaps it is a result of misunderstanding or other ignorance on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it is highly improbable, and really pushes the limits of plausibility, that the biodiversity and the complexity of some lifeforms that we have today, are the result of a blind process and chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I think that: Even in organisms with massive population numbers, the blind process of evolution simply has not had enough opportunities to take shots in the dark and tinker to successfully bring to bear all the components of a given species' body.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the heart for example. Just so you know, this isn't going to be your typical creationist/ID ""irreducible complexity"" argument.

&amp;#x200B;

To my knowledge, DNA coding didn't one day in the past just spit out an entire, completely ready-to-go heart, that would be VERY improbable and definitely pushing the limits of plausibility, but rather, each component, down to a small level, had to be coded as a result of random mutations, and then somehow brought together to function as a cohesive system, again as a result of mutations.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's focus in one on aspect of heart structure: the number of chambers. How did evolution arrive at the optimal number of chambers? Let's say you have the first organism who ever had a heart; call it ""Cardio originis."" Say you have 50,000 members of CO; do some members of CO have a DNA blueprint that says ""Necesssarily build 1 chamber"", others a blueprint that says ""Necessarily build 2 chambers"", and so on and so forth, with increasing numbers of chambers? If so, how is there a difference in numbers? Is it random mutations? Or, doe members of CO have a blueprint that says ""Randomization function: Randomly generate a number of chambers, represented by the variable N, subject to the constraints N = the range of integers 1-5""? Does DNA even have the ability to randomly generate a number each time an organism is conceived like this? Maybe in some populations both of these tactics are utilized?

&amp;#x200B;

With so many different components of a body, before you even get to humans, you'd have to have an astronomically high number of organisms in a population to produce a sufficient number of organisms healthy enough to survive long enough to reproduce and keep their offspring alive long enough to become breeders themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

If a given population member's heart is not put together sufficiently well enough for it to live, that member will obviously not survive, and not have offspring. When evolution is taking shots in the dark, and there are so many components, the vast majority of population members would be failures in the sense that they are unable to survive and unable to make offspring who can then breed themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, in reality, we see many species who never have large population numbers, and yet somehow, most of them manage to be healthy and well put together enough to survive, with failures being on the left side of the bell curve. Also, in reality, you see very little ""tinkering"" in a given species' population.

&amp;#x200B;

I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous. And yet, that is not the case.

evolution,enthto,theHating,,t2_3ywzyhmj,self.evolution,,Re: natural selection as a vacuous tautology," To restate, my intention here, as laid out in the OP, is to refute the following two claims:

1. There exists something that can sensibly be called ""THE theory of evolution"", and

2. The theory of evolution ""fits all the facts""



Near the start of their seminal 1972 paper on punctuated equilibria, Niles Eldredge and co-author Stephen Jay Gould specify the position they are militating against: the traditional Darwin-based theory of slow, steady, adaptive evolution. They refer to it as ""phyletic gradualism"".

Gould and Eldredge identify the following four tenets of phyletic gradualism (and I quote):

(1) New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendents

(2) The transformation is even and slow

(3) The transformation involves large numbers, usually the entire ancestral population

(4) The transformation occurs over all or a large part of the ancestral species' geographical range


One of the testable implications of phyletic gradualism is (and I quote again):

""Ideally, the fossil record for the origin of a new species should consist of a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant""



Now, as some of you may have discovered yourselves, you can show a frothing Darwinian pretty much anything you like and still be told, ""That's perfectly in accordance with my theory. My theory fits all the facts  "".

On the other hand, both thoughtful Darwinians (including CD himself) and their opponents have been aware since the publication of 'Origin' that phyletic gradualism does not fit all the facts: The fossil record does not typically consist of ""a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant"".

Few are more keenly aware of this theoretical embarrassment than paleontologists such as Eldredge and Gould themselves.


Does this mean, then, that phyletic gradualism is falsified and must be abandoned? Well, loyal patrons of my ""Falsifiability"" thread will hopefully be aware by now that there is rarely, if ever, a definitive refutation in empirical science. If its defenders are stubborn -- and ingenuous! -- enough, a seemingly troubled theory can always be shielded from falsification by (say) appeal to unrecognized forces or hidden variables, by postulating an undiscovered planet or subatomic particle, or by conjuring up a cosmological constant (as Einstein did).

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range



Conclusion:

""THE theory of evolution"", you say? Er, which one? 

""Fits/explains all the facts"", you say? Er, what does? ",12,1578863359,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/enthto/re_natural_selection_as_a_vacuous_tautology/

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Since the statistical approach uses actual repro-ductive values its empirical correctness cannot 
be tested by prediction and observation. It can 
only be tested against certain general theoretical 
principles. Consider the following case. Four 
dogs are on an island; two German shepherds one 
of each sex and two basset hounds one of each 
sex. Both bitches go into heat, basset mounts 
basset and German shepherd mounts German 
shepherd. While copulating the shepherds are 
fatally struck by lightning. The bassets, on the other 
hand, raise a nice family. Are the bassets there- 
fore better adapted to the island environment than the shepherds? To put the question another 
way, do we count this **differential** reproduction 
as natural selection?    
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Biologists usually define natural selection simply 
as **differential** reproduction (of genes, genotypes 
or phenotypes). But this is due to carelessness 
not lack of understanding. Most biologists would 
agree that the above case is not an instance of 
natural selection but rather a case of chance 
differences in fitness. (Not that it could not be 
natural selection, but nothing in the story indic- 
ates that it is. We can elaborate the story in 
ways that make it clear that it is not a case of 
natural selection. For instance, the only food 
source for dogs on our island might be animals 
whose size and ferocity would make it relatively 
easier for the larger shepherds to eat than the 
bassets. Furthermore lightning might be a rare 
phenomenon and indifferent between bassets 
and shepherds.) How then shall we characterize 
natural selection? The concept must be defined in 
terms of the as yet undefined notion of adapted- 
ness. Natural selection is not just differential 
reproduction but rather is **differential** reproduc-tion which is due to the adaptive superiority of 
those who leave more offspring.

1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics does not follow the classic laws of nature. As the example of note, Quantum tunneling occurs when a subatomic particle passes much like a ghost through a potential barrier or wall. Sunlight, or two fused hydrogen atoms that have created this proton, is able to pass through the walls of the structure your in by teleporting from one place to another instantaneously. Classical laws of mechanics are unable to explain the way in which this subatomic particle gains sufficient energy to make the trip without enough fuel, or energy. In fact, as the theory goes, these little guys obtain energy from it’s surrounding environment to “tunnel through the wall” (Davies, 2005).

To continue with the amazement of quantum mechanics we go with a look at with the work on cell microtubules of (Mavromatos and Nanopoulos, 1999); cell microtubules contain a “presynaptic grid like a quantum hologram.”

To reiterate slightly, tunneling subatomic particles actually pay back the energy they have borrowed from the environment; “reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been” (Davies, 2005).

2. Cellular Enzymes and Tunneling

Hydrogen, the basic building block of all of life relies on the chemical functionality of Hydrogen transfer, a sequence which utilizes quantum tunneling (Heyes, Sakuma, M., de Visser, S. P., &amp; Scrutton, N. S. 2009). Enzymes

3. A Bold Statement

Hydrogen, or H(2)O(2) is acutely toxic to cellular vitality. According to Mishra and Imlay (2012); Hydrogen transfer reactions perform “H-transfer by tunneling.” And here we surmise the notion, that that *cells have a holographic membrane in which quantum tunneling fuels hydrogen function within enzymatic processes*.

4. A History Reminder on Bacteria and Evolution

“The complete cDNA for a human mitochondrial protein designated P1, which was previously identified as a microtubule-related protein, has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of P1 shows strong homology (40 to 50% identical residues and an additional 20% conservative replacements) to the 65-kilodalton major antigen of mycobacteria, to the GroEL protein of Escherichia coli, and to the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (rubisco) subunit binding protein” (Jindal, 1989).

It is commonly known through the evolutionary branch that mitochondria within the human cell formed from an ancient bacterium. As the story goes, a bacterium survived within a host cell and built the functionality of the cell as it’s survival host. Further, bacteria are known to be the first life-form to have ever been. Here we argue that since bacteria and the mitochondria are the keys to evolution and life that indeed our genetic evolutionary direction can be found within the mysterial holographic field of a cell in which hydrogen performs the magic of quantum tunneling.

5. Where’s Waldo

“H-transfer by tunneling is an important feature of these reactions in enzymes (1–3), but mechanistic understanding of how protein motions (from the millisecond to sub-picosecond time domain) facilitate the H-tunneling reactions remains elusive (4– 6). A major limitation has been the inability to synchronously trigger catalysis on ultrafast time scales for the majority of enzymes that require mixing strategies to initiate the reaction. However, by using the light-activated enzyme, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR4 ; EC 1.3.1.33) (7), we have triggered two enzymatic H-transfer reactions using a single pulse of light, and we show these reactions occur sequentially by quantum tunneling in a pre-formed enzyme-substrate complex. This has provided a unique opportunity to analyze these reactions at physiological and cryogenic temperatures, on very fast time scales, that are experimentally inaccessible with other enzyme systems” (Heyes, 2009). 

6. God’s Quanta

So with this, it is postulated that life both originates and evolves through not simply the physiological framework of biochemical or biomolecular processes but through this quantum biological fashion: The human cell is directly connected to the quantum world where tunneling – a process that cannot be directly measured as the electron of interest is never traceable to one position – may prove the possibility for possibility in a predeterministic mechanical universe, known here as my theory of God’s Quanta. This idea surmises that the *spaghetti monster* is nothing more than an idea where instead the over between one’s body and one’s soul are found as their quantum holographic signature. Here we see the link that has been explored since the beginning of the inquisition of a God existing.

7. Conclusion

We live within a deterministic world, governed by classical laws of mechanics. God’s Quanta, I believe, explains where free will connects to the spirit of us as human beings. In that, electrons can be at the same place ate the same time, or neither at once; (tunneling), opening the possibility of impossibility in a predictable universe. Each cell has a quantum hologram where this magic takes place and I argue this could scientifically be the soul as it reacts with another dimension from our dimension (if you will), through our cells. Again, cells again are founded from bacteria which began all life.

The math is over my head, but he responded to say that the numbers used to calculate the rate of change were not usefully determined. Could anyone offer some clarification on the rest of the math? Here are the problems he found:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The authors make an assumption that begs the question, fatally. They calculate their value *K* based on “a rough estimate that only one mutation in 10,000 is selectively favored over the resident gene type.” Where did they get that 1/10,000 value? The ratio of selectively favored changes to non-favored is *central* to the whole discussion! They offer no math nor cite other sources to show this is a valid “estimate”. And there is good reason to believe it is a wild overestimation. 
2. The authors additionally concede that “further modifications are needed to the calculations since, because of stochastic events, only a proportion of selectively favored new mutations become fixed in a population.” So, their calculations do not take into account fixing those favorable mutations. That’s not a trivial point, particularly while they’ve also assumed a population size producing 1,000,000 births per year. This is just more question-begging, although not as egregious as the first error, since they admit the omission. 
3. The authors use nonsensical values for their *K* and *L* terms. This one involves some math that I \*do\* understand; let me summarize just in case it's helpful. In the header paragraph, the authors introduce definitions for *K* and *L*: *L* is the length of the genomic “word,” and *K* is the number of possible “letters” that can occupy any position in the word. So far so good. In these terms, the *total* number of permutations (possible “words”) is equal to *KL*. Note that I’m not yet arguing about the “numbers of necessary mutations”. This is just the simple combinatorial equation for calculating the number of permutations using the variable names they’ve defined. For example, if we want to know the total number of *possible* three-letter words using the modern English alphabet, then we’d let K = 26 and L = 3. We’d then calculate that there are 263 (or 26x26x26) possible three-letter words. Just basic math here; nothing to squabble over yet.

But! For their L value, the authors pick 20,000 — an estimate for the number of *genes* in the human genome — as the length of their “word”. So, is the entire genome their “word”? This is very peculiar because there is no defined set of “letters” that can occupy any one position (gene locus). Each gene locus may be of a varied length (typically many thousands of amino acids long), so there are *many* (understatement) possible permutations of each gene locus (many *possible* alleles). Calculating “the probability that all *L* letters of the given word will be guessed correctly” (as they attempt to do in their analysis) only makes sense when the “word” is composed of a discrete and known set of “letters”, as in my three-letter word example above. 

If their choice in *L* value is nonsensical, their *K* value (number of possible “letters”, according to their own definition) is absurd: The value *K* = 40 is arrived at by using the value 250 found above for the number of de novo mutations per gene locus per year and a rough estimate that only one mutation in 10,000 is selectively favored over the resident gene type. 

Even if those numbers are at all accurate, why do they divide 10,000 (from their estimated ratio of selectively favored mutations, 1/10,000) by the 250 figure to reach their value of 40? And how does this constitute a meaningful number of possible “letters”? No explanation is given — it is absolutely absurd. 

After all, though, they do say that “the force of our result does not depend on the numerical values that one assigns to K and L.” So am I making too much out of their problematic choices in numbers? I really don’t think so, because the whole premise is based around their assumptions about what *K* and *L* mean. To my next point…

Because they inexplicably think they should use the number of gene loci as their *L* value, they make an (unsubstantiated) claim that “a more appropriate model is the following: After guessing each of the letters, we are told which (if any) of the guessed letters are correct, and then those letters are retained.” This only *kind of* makes sense by proposing each entire gene locus is a “letter”. Then, perhaps fixing a favorable mutation at one gene locus is like being “told” we guessed a correct letter. (Note, though, that this still begs the question of how multiple favorable mutations could get fixed “in parallel”, but I’ll leave that aside.)

But again, it’s absurd to consider the total number of gene loci as the length of our word! The authors completely ignore the fact that gene mutations occur at the level of amino acids. Though a population may be “told” when a favorable mutation has occurred in a gene (via natural selection), a gene certainly cannot be “told” when a correct “letter” (amino acid) is guessed. Gene mutations, at least in nature, are random changes to amino acids. Only when *all* of the necessary changes to amino acids that produce a favorable mutation are made can selective pressures fix that mutation in the population. Therefore, any math based on the assumption that nature somehow knows when one or more (but not all) letters are correctly guessed is fatally flawed from the start.

Looking at a *specific* gene locus as our “word” makes much more sense because, then, the set of available “letters” is actually meaningful: the 20 amino acids that compose DNA. (One could also consider the 4 nucleotide base pairs as our set of letters, since a string of 3 base pairs form a single amino acid.) This is where combinatorial mathematics can be helpful — and where it becomes extremely problematic for the evolutionist. A short gene may contain 150 amino acids. For genes of this length, the total number of possible permutations is 20150. So even such a short gene has a practically incomprehensibly large number of permutations. While I \*think\* this provides some good indication that supposing 1 in 10,000 mutations will be favorable is a wild overestimation, it at very least highlights my point that we cannot consider the set of possible gene *alleles* as our list of possible “letters”. 

A final, lesser point just serves to highlight my lack of confidence in the article. In speaking of the “incorrect argument”, the authors suggest that the “mean number of rounds of guessing until the correct sequence is found is indeed *KL*.” But clearly, *KL* is the *total* number of *possible* sequences. Rather, the mean (average) number of attempts that it would take to get the intended/correct word is *KL* / 2. Either the authors don’t have the command of mathematics that their article might indicate, or this is a typographical error, which would suggest the article was written in haste or not properly peer-reviewed.",11,1578471281,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/elpx4b/there_isnt_enough_time_for_evolution/

So just how *did* Shakespeare write Shakespeare, and just how did life build humanity?

# Infinite Monkeys, Infinite Shakespeare

It is a common bit of urban science that, if infinite monkeys were placed in front of infinite typewriters, one of them would bang out the complete works of Shakespeare.

It’s wrong, of course. One of them would *not* type out Shakespeare.

An infinite number of them would.

And not just Shakespeare. They would type out everything that has ever been written, and everything that ever will be written… and each of those an infinite number of times.  They would type my biography, in exquisite detail, an infinite number of times, and the biographies of you, and of everyone else. They would also type out our biographies with perfect predictions of what would have happened if we had made each tiny choice in our lives differently. And again, that’s for everyone who ever lived.

And even for everyone who *never* lived — all an infinite number of times. So infinities are not just large, they’re, well, infinitely large. Everything can happen.

Heck, everything *will* happen.

# Insoluble Problems

All of this points up the absurdity of trying to wrap our heads around infinity. But the preceding brings up a second important insight about random chance and large numbers:  once our infinite monkeys have typed out the things that I just described, looking through all of it to find our biographies would require more time and energy — infinitely more time and energy? — than just getting on with our lives. There are problems that are just too large to solve.

Very small problems can also resist solution. Remember, physicists still can't resolve a 3-body gravitational situation, and mathematicians have no general solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

To our purposes here on considering the role of biology in the larger scope of human progress, one of the very large problems science can't solve is predicting the future. That's because the future is infinite, as well.

# Science &amp; Prediction

But predicting the future is the whole point of science.  Modern science begins with the war machines of the Renaissance: What trajectory will drop a cannonball in precisely the right place? It proved to be an important question. A century or two later, Newton would describe an ever-lengthening cannonball trajectory to explain celestial orbits.

In 'pure' scientific research we sometimes lose site of the importance of prediction.  But an activity isn't science until it generates a testable theory, which means a theory that predicts what will happen.  Which means that science is always an attempt to predict the future.

Or rather, science and experiment attempt to predict the future *when many things are controlled for*. If we don't eliminate the many confounding aspects outside of the experiment, if we can't neutralize the messiness of reality, there is no strong predictability.  The system becomes too large to resolve, and accurate prediction becomes impossible.

This is true even for some of the most complex of our undertakings, such as sending a person to the moon.  Launching a rocket, as complex as the rocket is, is still a relatively straight-forward physics &amp; engineering problem.

Unless there's wind. If there's much wind, the flight becomes iffy, and NASA postpones it.  One of the reasons we launch rockets from Cape Canaveral is the mild weather.

So outside of our blinkered experiments, predicting the future with certainty isn't possible. Which means that for many of the big problems of life, for systems where there are many independent factors and actors, there is not much predictability.

So how should we go about making intelligent choices?

# Hard Science vs Soft Science

This is why biology, as a hybrid between 'hard' and 'soft' science, is so important. Hard science says that A plus B always equal C.  Soft science says that A plus B *often* gives us C, but may also give us D, E, Ω, 我,  or even something we've never seen before.  So while hard science gives us accurate formulas and tight predictability, soft science can only offer us general patterns with fuzzy outcomes. For complex systems, that's the best we get; the general models and trends of soft science become our only option in the real world, where hard science and strong predictability fail.

So for the very large problems of life, the only sensible way forward is to look at the understood possibilities, try not to worry too much about other possibilities, then pick some reasonable path and and continue our journey.

That, by the way, was a plot-spoiler.

# Finite Shakespeare

Let's return to our problem of our copying quadrumanids. (One of the old names for primates was Quadrumana, or 'four-handed'.)  As noted, even problems much smaller than infinity can pose insurmountable obstacles to human understanding.

For instance, if we only want a single copy of Shakespeare, we don’t need an infinite number of primates. I downloaded the complete works of Shakespeare from [*Gutenberg.org*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) and pasted it into [*LibreOffice Writer*](https://www.libreoffice.org).  *Writer* says the document contains 958,340 words and 5,382,946 letters and spaces. If we round the latter number up to 5.4M characters, and accept a character set of 37 letters, numbers, and a space, then we only need about 37×10^(5,400,000), or 2×10^(8,500,000) primates. Which is a relief, because that is much smaller than infinity.

But then, everything is much smaller than infinity.

Then, if we extend the time frame and let our printing primates try repeatedly, we can shrink that number yet again.

But it is not really helpful either way, because to produce enough primates and typewriters, even through the 14 billion years that the universe has existed, there is not be enough matter and energy within said universe. In fact, there wouldn’t be enough matter and energy in a billion trillion quadrillion universes.

So for our discussion, 2×10^(8,500,000) primates might as well be an infinity, because it still represents an impossibility.  Numbers that big are much larger than our brains, our mathematics, or our computers can deal with in any useful way.

# Shakespeare vs the Human Genome

And yet, as large as that number is, it is nevertheless exquisitely small compared to number of generators, primate or otherwise, that we would need to randomly generate the human genome.

The DNA in each human cell\* contains about 3B ‘base pairs’, which we can think of as molecular letters. There are only four such letters, or base pairs, and they serve as identifiers to ‘type out’ the links in a strand of protein. The resulting proteins are either used directly in things like muscle fiber and the support structure of our bodies; or they fold themselves into enzymes, which then direct and enable chemical pathways, so that they build everything else the body needs.

Fortunately, 3B base pairs is more than we really need to build a human. In truth, only about 8% of our DNA appears to be active. Now, the other 92% is not insignificant, as the total DNA in a typical 70kg (155lb) adult amounts to about 100 grams, or around a quarter of a pound. However, if all of that DNA were laid end-to-end, it would reach the sun and back 600 times.

But by reducing our number to 8% of the total DNA, we 'only' need 240M base pairs in the blueprint for building a human. Nevertheless, 4^(240,000,000) (or 10^(140,000,000)) is vastly larger than the number of primates (2×10^(8,500,000)) we would need to randomly type us up even one copy of Shakespeare.

# Shrews and Butterflies

All of these numbers represent more than simple diversion, however. They raise a couple of important questions:

Just how did Shakespeare write Shakespeare?

And just how did life create a human being?

Those questions may seem fatuous, but by the end of this book they may not still seem so ridiculous. As brilliant as *The Taming of the Shrew* might be, it dims in marvelousness and complexity when compared to the everyday, humdrum, garden variety of shrew. Likewise, Puccini’s *Madama Butterfly* contains some of the most exquisite music ever written, but its brilliance pales when compared to a real butterfly.

# Order from Randomness

The point is, neither Shakespeare nor biology produced their respective genius in a completely random fashion, as typing monkeys would have done. Yes, Shakespeare's effort is intellectual, whereas the rest of nature is a spontaneous event, a remote result of the Big Bang. (Some would argue that Shakespeare and life are a result of the Big Deity. Many people scoff at that, but uncritically accept the Big Bang, even though both of them require a generous dollop of magic and mysticism. But I digress. For this argument, we're sticking with the Big Bang.)

Nevertheless, Shakespeare and life provide an essential insight going forward. We have some rudimentary ideas about the extraordinary circumstances that produced the shrew and the butterfly. Both of those are much more complicated, *i.e*., they are more unlikely, than human creativity.  *Making* a Shakespeare is a lot more complicated than *writing* Shakespeare.

# Exploring Genius

In effect, the genius of natural selection is greater than the genius of humanity. So it would not be surprising that, by studying the much larger problems that evolution solves, we might gain insight into fostering human creativity, progress, and yes, even genius.  I suggest that progress in life can shed light on how we might generate more progress in our lives; even including more great literature and music.

I argue that biological innovation can provide insight into human innovation, and how we might promote and accelerate human progress.  But first, we must accept that the best tools we have for proceeding are the general patterns and inconsistent outcomes of 'soft' science.

evolution,eknh0j,HumanEvolutionSGR,,t2_5dq035zu,self.evolution,question,To what degree is masculinity and femininity embedded in human beings' nature as a consequence of evolution?,"I was reading a book on biology and it said that some theories behind human sexual attraction and the evolution thereof claim that gynephillic men are genetically predisposed to find things like full lips, wide hips, etc., sexually attractive on a woman.
Likewise, it said that androphilic women are genetically predisposed to find things like broad shoulders, physical vstrength, etc., sexually attractive on a man.

Now, in the social sciences and anthropology masculinity and femininity is sometimes defended and claimed to be a sociocultural construction, meaning that it is we humans who compose gender norms, say what is ""masculine"" and what is ""feminine"", and the like. So with this in mind, to what degree can one say that masculinity and femininity are embedded in humankind's evolutionary make-up, if what some social scientists and anthropologists claim about masculinity and femininity is true?

Is it true, for example, that heterosexual men, who are mostly gynephillic, have a genetic predisposition to be attracted to a vulva and not a penis? If so, does not that exclude trans* people (or intersex people), for example, who are preoperative or nonoperative but who are feminine-presenting and or feminine in gender identity from being considered sexually attractive from an evolutionary standpoint by heterosexual and or gynephillic men if they still have the penile anatomy with which most assigned male people at birth are born?

evolution,ekn0o5,CuriousIndividual0,,t2_rq4fy,self.evolution,question,"What other deeply rooted evolutionary urges do we have, apart from food (sugar, fat, &amp; salt)?","Currently reading [Evolution’s Sweet Tooth](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/opinion/evolutions-sweet-tooth.html) a NYT article by Daniel E. Lieberman a Harvard evolutionary biologist. In it he writes:

&gt;The food industry has made a fortune because we retain Stone Age bodies that crave sugar but live in a Space Age world in which sugar is cheap and plentiful. Sip by sip and nibble by nibble, more of us gain weight because we can’t control normal, deeply rooted urges for a valuable, tasty and once limited resource.

Although i've heard this many times before, it's the first time i've heard it from an evolutionary biologist, but it made me wonder what other ""deeply rooted evolutionary urges"" do we have apart from those related to food?

The first thing that comes to mind is the pleasurableness of sex. Perhaps the most intense pleasurable feeling is that of an orgasm, and for good reason considering successful reproduction is that which is fundamentally selected for. 

But what else fits under this category as well? If I were to define it roughly it would be something like: positive or negative sensations induced by some environmental factor in order to guide behaviour with some degree of automaticity or lack of conscious control, selection for which, provided an advantage in prehistoric times. 

I remember hearing somewhere that young children in cities that have never seen a snake before have a negative reaction towards photos of snakes. So perhaps fleeing from a snake is also a deep rooted evolutionary urge?

What else is there?



So perhaps it's better to ask what are some other *non-contentious* deeply rooted evolutionary urges?",15,1578276221,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/ekn0o5/what_other_deeply_rooted_evolutionary_urges_do_we/

We need food to survive, so we (1) found ways to produce food and (2) found ways to hoard a profit from it. 

We need shelter to survive so we (1) figured out how to make shelters and (2) figured out how to profit from it and push the concept of shelter to its avaricious limits. 

We felt the need to migrate from place to place so we (1) created means of transportation and then (2) exploited it for profit (to the point where scientists say the planet will soon cease to be inhabitable). 

Etc etc 

But what if other life forms on other planets don’t have the same needs and vices as humans do? 

A bunny rabbit doesn’t care about building skyscrapers or playing the stock market. There are humans much more miserable than bunny rabbits. I think there are organisms that barely need food or water or that survive on sunlight. Are we sure we are more intelligent than they are? They seem to have it together pretty well and humans seem to be an absolute wreck.

This means that eventually, too many women will lead to a population increase and considering how resources are scarce, this means people have to spread and cultivate more land and so on and on. This will eventually displace other creatures, lower diversity, and it leads to what we are currently facing. An everlasting famine, extinction of species and our own extinction. My question lies in the issue that usually in the wild, we have the lion with his herd of lionnesses. Is the ratio of sexes meant to not go further from 1:1 or is it actually this reason, that it is 1:1 that is leading to this destruction of our environment (speaking of humans only)? **Is the fact that some species have an overabundance of females as a result of the fact they are going extinct?

My mind is a little bit blown.

I saw culture as an interesting froth on top of those mechanisms that clearly had some impact but not that much.

However, Henrich makes a convincing case (to me at least) that our ability to learn from others was a highly significant force in our evolution from as long ago as 2 million years, and plays a much larger role in our day to day lives than I realised.

Has anyone else read it? Have there been shifts in thought in recent years in psychology and anthropology generally along these lines?

I was reading the God Delusion by Dawkins (super funny, fairly easy read, highly recommend) and I come across what seems to be his central argument against intelligent design which is that ID is a sky hook that pulls up all of the universe from the metaphorical “ground” of nothingness. (And I’m paraphrasing here)

Darwinian evolution pulls the world up from nothingness with a crane from that nothingness. 

That definitely makes sense and he admits there are problems with it but the sky hook definitely makes no sense because it isn’t metaphorically “grounded” to anything. 

My question is that how can he criticize the sky hook when he can’t explain where the “ground” came from? In both theories doesn’t there have to exist something before the “Big Bang”. Like no matter what doesn’t a multiverse and a nuanced view of time have to exist?

evolution,efw8zw,Bookscrounger,Behavioral Ecology,t2_uck7l,self.evolution,,Biological Numbers vs Astronomical Numbers,"As large as astronomical numbers are, biological numbers are vastly larger. In addition, biological systems comprise a meticulous, repeatable order that is not present in astronomical systems. But the real difference between biology and the 'hard' sciences, is that life innovates.  Physics and chemistry study what has been true for billions of years, but biology is required to constantly explain the novel, and to explore creativity and innovation.

# Astronomical Numbers

Astronomical numbers are, well, astronomical.  By some estimations, there are 2 trillion (2×10^(12)) galaxies, each with about 100 million (10^(8)) stars.  Factored together, that gives us about 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 2×10^(20) stars.

Each star, however, is also enormous.  Our Sun, about average size, has a mass of 2×10^(30) kilograms.  If we multiply that times the number of stars, it gives us 4×10^(51) kilograms of starmass out there. Even that doesn’t come close to representing the size of astronomical numbers, because there is a much larger amount of unseen ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’ in the universe, which physicists struggle to understand and estimate.

Then there are the distances involved in astronomical numbers.  The diameter of the visible universe is estimated to be about 9×10^(26) meters.  It would take a beam of light about 93 billion years to cover that distance.

# Eukaryotic Cell Numbers

All of this is impressive, but in our wonder at the universe out there, we sometimes miss the wonder of the universe right here, around us and even within us.  For instance, How many cells are there on Earth?

Consider humanity. There are roughly 3×10^(13) cells in the human body.   That is a large number, more than the number of galaxies, but still small by astronomical measures.  However, we need to multiply that by 7 billion people alive today, giving about 2×10^(23) human cells on the planet. That means there are perhaps 100 living human cells for every star in the universe. Biological numbers can also be large.

But we can’t stop there.  Even with our current population explosion, humanity makes up a minuscule fraction of living things, and an equally small fraction of the total weight (‘biomass’) of everything that lives on our planet. In a celebrated example, consider that 1/5 of all described species of animals—  not just insects, but all animals: mammals, birds, fish, worms and many, many others— are just beetles.(One evening a group of English clerics encountered the great biologist J.B.S. Haldane. They asked him what his constant study of biology had taught him about the mind of the Creator.  Haldane quipped, “An inordinate fondness for beetles.”) I could find no estimates for the total number of beetles within all of those species, but it would not be surprising to find that the number of beetles’ cells on the planet greatly surpasses the number of human cells.

The weight of all living things — again, the ‘ biomass’ — of the earth, minus the bacteria, is about 11×10^(12) kg.  Extrapolating from an average 70kg human, this means that humans only comprise about 0.06% of the earth’s biomass. Factoring the number of human cells by our percent of the biomass, gives us biological numbers of about 4×10^(27) cells on the planet, a million cells for every star.

# Bacterial Numbers

But again, that’s without the bacteria and their relatives, and they are critical for answering the question of how many cells on Earth.

By themselves, bacteria on earth represent about 10^(30) cells, or over 1,000 bacteria for every cell in large organisms like people and trees.  Clearly, we could have started our considerations with bacteria to calculate biological numbers, and simply ignored the more complex living things.

On the other hand, the inclusion of bacteria brings up an interesting consideration with plants, animals, and algae, which are classified as ‘eukaryotes’.  Within our cells, most eukaryotes carry even smaller entities, ‘organelles’, some of which have their own genetic material (if you remember high school biology, these organelles are the mitochondria in animals, and chloroplasts in plants and algae).  These are believed to be descended from ancient bacteria. They generally number from 100 to 2,000 per cell. For our purposes here, we need to include them in our consideration of biological numbers. If we estimate that there are 1,000 such organelles per cell, that elevates complex organisms to about the number of bacteria, which might double the number we estimated for bacteria alone.

# Virus Numbers

Then there are the viruses.  Viruses are not living. If we imagined that our computers were living things, then viruses would be thumb drives.  They can’t do any computing by themselves, but they ‘inject’ information that directs the computer. Some thumb drives carry malicious information which takes over the entire machine and forces it to infect other computers with the same contagious software.  Which is pretty much what viruses do.

So viruses are not alive, but just as thumb drives are ‘descended’ from fully-functioning computers, so viruses are created from, descended from, and perpetuated by, living things. For our upcoming needs, we should also count them. It is estimated that there may be 10^(31) viruses on earth, or 10 viruses for every bacterium.

# Geologic Time Scale Numbers

We’re still not finished.  We must factor these extraordinary numbers over geologic time scales.  Life has been on earth for about 3.5 billion years. For simplicity, assume that the average lifespan for a cell is one year.

That is probably generous, since bacteria may not even last that long.  On the other hand, ‘lifespan’ is hard to define in microbes, some may survive indefinitely. Consider the beer, Flag Porter 1825. It is brewed from yeast which was recovered in 1988 from a ship that sunk in the English Channel in 1825 (produced by the *Darwin* Brewery, ironic for our discussion here). Obviously, some of the yeast in it survived 150 years.

Far beyond that time span, however, we could also make the argument that bacteria can live 3.5 billion years. Because bacteria only divide in direct lineages without sexual reproduction, we could argue that the very first bacterium is not only still alive, it now numbers 10^(30) in population. In fact, we could argue that all living cells, organelles, and viruses, are still the first bacterium. That one-celled jot has simply divided repeatedly throughout the diversification of life on the planet. We could take the view that the original bacterium lives on somewhere within every existing cell and virus.

# Biological Numbers

Returning to our calculations of biological numbers, if we take the number of living cells and viruses and multiply them times 3.5 billion years, that gives us gives us about 10^(40) cell and cell descendants through biological history. That is the largest answer to the question of ‘How many cells on Earth?’

But compare those 10^(40) cell and cell descendants to 2×10^(21) stars; Easily, since the beginning of life on earth there have been over a quintillion cell descendants for every star in the universe.

Of course as we noted, each star is staggeringly massive when compared to a bacterium. But that is inevitable. All of these biological numbers have appeared on a negligible mote of dust orbiting an average star, tucked away into the margins of an unremarkable galaxy. Given that insight, which is the more impressive, the astronomical numbers of a massive star with its powerful, matter-shearing forces? Or the biological numbers presented by the minuscule bacterium with its fabulously intricate molecular gearbox?

# Cell Complexity

Each cell demonstrates a peculiar, finely-tuned and precisely repeatable organization and complexity which stars do not have. (Repeatable order’ and ‘complexity’ are not so clear, nor easy to defend as one might think.  Every star is perfectly ordered. It’s just 	that we cannot track, measure, nor fully understand the order. Within a star, we only calculate extremely small atomic interactions, and extremely large mass effects. The repeated order of the cell, however, is well within our ability to track and understand, at least roughly, from atom to complete cell.) The precise, mechanistic repeatability of cells is not found in stars. Beyond that, each cell line copies and recopies its own highly controlled, and minutely faithful, order into yet other cells. This does not happen in stars.

But the most important idea in all of this, and one for which we will need these numbers in future discussions, is that we do not believe that the basic patterns of the universe have changed over the past 3.5 billion years. During the time that life has existed on this planet, we do not believe that any fundamentally new processes, nor entities, have appeared in all of those vast entities out there in the universe.

# Biological Innovation

Correction: we don’t believe that those basic patterns have changed anywhere *outside of Earth*. Because over that same 3.5 billion years, life has changed rapidly. It has evolved, innovated, and progressed: throughout that enormous time scale, new kinds of cells and new kinds of life have appeared, and continue to appear. In addition, those new kinds of life have constantly fabricated entirely new, highly complex products.  This is the fundamental difference between biology and physics: biology innovates.

Life evolves, which means it gives us completely new things to study, things which did not exist before. Without life and natural selection, there might be no novelty in the universe. It’s an important insight, because I will argue that all novelty—biological, artificial, digital—follows some basic biological principles.

# Prospective Science and Progress

This difference between biology and physics brings up another consideration, and one which offers problems for scientific investigation: the hard sciences are necessarily retrospective.  They look at what already exists, and extrapolate from there.

Which means they are not always prepared to consider the future.  Biology, particularly the ‘soft science’ side of biology, considers such things frequently. Evolutionary biology is both retrospective and prospective, biologists look backward and forward.  Biology constantly tries to understand things that did not exist before, and which have no precedent. Again, I will propose that the tools of biology can help us to understand innovation, creativity, and human progress.  That is where we are headed.

So the point of all this is not scientific one-upmanship, the goal is not for biology to claim some superiority over astronomy and chemistry.  All disciplines contain an infinite number of problems to solve, which will require the focus of the greatest minds we have. We will never know everything about any topic in nature. In all disciplines, we are dealing with numbers, and problems, that are just too large to understand.

And, as I will suggest in upcoming essays, it is exactly those incomprehensible numbers that are critical to understanding innovation.

We evolved to such a point that we created our own form of natural selection that doesn’t actually depend on survivability, but acceptability.

**What are the REAL mechanisms of biodiversity, replacing macroevolution?**  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_IGrzrk6iBEre=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IGrzrk6iBEre=youtu.be)  


[http://reasonandscience.catsboard.com/t2316-evolution-where-do-complex-organisms-come-from](http://reasonandscience.catsboard.com/t2316-evolution-where-do-complex-organisms-come-from)  


Based on evidence seen in biochemistry on a molecular level, we can now say affirmatively and conclusively, that Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection in regards of first degree speciation &amp; macroevolutionary level has been falsified.  


The real mechanisms that explain biodiversity and complex organismal architecture is preprogrammed instructional complex INFORMATION encoded in various genetic and epigenetic languages and communication by various signalling codes through various signalling networks  


That brings us to the origin by an intelligent designer.  


Pinpointing what REALLY defines body architecture, the orchestration of organism development, cell shape and body form and the mechanisms of adaptation and primary speciation, and exposing the correct explanation of biochemical mechanisms of biodiversity is the holy grail of biological sciences. Preprogrammed codified information and signalling replaces Darwin's theory and its various subsequent adaptations, extensions, and new proposals like the modern extended synthesis or the so-called "" third way "". The true mechanism is "" Biochemical systems programming and signalling"", and special creation of species and/or kinds by an intelligent powerful creator. Long periods of time and gradual, evolutionary development is not possible, face the fact that cells and organisms work like gigantic interlocked machines and factory complexes, where in any case, if one tiny part is missing, nothing goes. Natural selection would not select for components of a complex system that would be useful only in the completion of that much larger system. No glycine amino acids, no pyrimidines, no DNA - no life. No Watson Crick base pair fine-tuning, no DNA - no life. No ribosomal mechanism for amino acid amide bondage, no proteins, no life. No nitrogenase enzymes to fix nitrogen in an energy demanding, triple bond breaking process, no ammonia, required to make amino acids - no nitrogen cycle - no advanced life. No chlorophylls, no absorption of light to start photosynthesis, no starch and glucose - cells will have no food supply to sustain complex organisms - no advanced life on earth. No rubisco, no fix of CO2, no hydrocarbons - no advanced life. No counterion in retinal, and rhodopsin could not receive visible light - and there would be no vision on earth by any organism.  


1. The **Gene regulation network** orchestrates gene expression  
2. **Various signalling pathways** generate Cell types and patterns  
3. At least 23 **Epigenetic Codes** are multidimensional and perform various tasks essential to cell structure and development  
4. **Cell-Cell communication** in various forms, especially important for animal development  
5. **Chromatin dance in the nucleus** through extensile motors affect transcription and gene regulation  
6. **Post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of histones** affect gene transcription  
7. The **DNA methylation code** is like a barcode or marker, the methyl group indicates, for instance, which genes in the DNA are to be turned on.  
8. **Homeobox and Hox genes** determine the shape of the body.  
9. **Noncoding DNA  ( Junk DNA )** is transcribed into functional non-coding RNA molecules and switches protein-coding genes on or off.  
10.  **Transposons** **and Retrotransposons** regulate genes  
11. **Centrosomes** play a central role in development  
12. The precise **arrangement of Cytoskeletal arrays** provides critical structural information.

I am also not trying to promote an anthropocentric worldview. I am simply asking if evolutionary theory is at all teleological? I realize this is a strange question, but I was debating with a philosopher of biology about this recently (I am a college freshman if you're wondering). He was arguing that evolutionary theorists view evolution by natural selection as purposeless. It's a process that exists, but it doesn't have a purpose in the sense that gravity doesn't have a purpose. I argued that life has a purpose (i.e. that of propagating itself). He didn't have anything to say on that subject, but he emphatically denied that evolution is purposeful. On a slightly different note, do most evolutionary biologists believe that evolution is progressive? In other words, does evolution by natural selection lead to greater and greater complexity? I know Richard Dawkins argues that evolution is progressive and the Stephen Jay Gould vehemently opposed the idea. 

I realize the internet can't give me definitive answers to these questions. I just wanted to hear from other people on these matters. I am very interested in evolutionary theory and I am currently majoring in zoology. When I was younger, I thought I understood evolutionary theory.

evolution,e8ahcm,LGBTQEvolutionQ,,t2_56oym8eq,self.evolution,question,"Evolutionarily, why does paedophilia exist?","First, and it genuinely saddens me that I have to even say this, but, alas, there a people in this world who do destroy children's lives when they partake in sexual activity with them against their will: I am *not* in *any* way *whatsoever* advocating for or speaking out in support of pedophilia of *any* kind at *any* time towards *any* child. I am principally asking this question because a) I have a deep, deep fascination with evolution and how non-heterosexual and non-teleiophilic and otherwise atypical sexual, gender, etc., expressions exist, function and the like according to human evolution, and b) because I got such an amazing list of comments from people about [my post on the evolutionary function of homosexuality and other LGBTQ+-related practices, desires, etc] (https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e81c9d/what_function_does_homosexuality_evolutionary/?).

I fully appreciate that this topic is very controversial and thorny, so I ask this question with the greatest amount of respect possible, as I understand that for some people it may be very, very triggering to read and come across.

Frankly, I can now see thanks to all of you giving me great responses, etc., to my question on LGBTQ+-related things how evolution and LGBTQ+ things can and do work with evolution, but with pedophilia I really am just baffled, as unlike LGBTQ+ people who may end up raising young or something similar when a child(s) parent(s) die or something, I can't see where this possibly comes in.

By definition a paedophile is one who is sexually attracted to prepubescent individuals. If this definition is correct, and I believe it is, then since *no* typical prepubescent person, as far as I am aware, can ever procreate wherever does pedophilia come into the equation? Why does it exist? How does an older person, generally an adult, but I suppose any pubescent or postpubescent person, having sex with or desiring prepubescent individuals serve evolution in any way whatsoever? The typical prepubescent individual cannot produce sperm, so they cannot possibly create any new human life through sexual reproduction with a person with a vagina. Likewise, no prepubescent person with a vagina can get impregnated and thus give birth to any child, so I really do fail to see how pedophilia came about in humankind's evolutionary history, and, moreover, I fail to see why pedophilic attraction be evolutionarily advantageous to anyone in evolutionary terms.

I wish to say as a very last note that my understanding of evolution, human evolution in our case, is that just because something exists amongst humankind does not mean that it is a) good, or b) advantageous to the modern human being. What I do believe it does mean, however, is that the human being *may* have benefited from certain things in the past.
That is my lay understanding, so is someone could enlighten me on anything to do with this last note then it'd be most appreciated.

I wish to say that I apologize once again in advance for any replies that are not too immediate --- and, yes, I do promise that I will respond to responders on my post on homosexuality and other LGBTQ+-related things in an evolutionary context, but I haven't had the chance to thus far as I have been doing a ton of research.",28,1575900942,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e8ahcm/evolutionarily_why_does_paedophilia_exist/

Here's a possible way to sidestep the ""Information First - Metabolism First"" question. I call it ""Encapsulation First"" and ask you to put your imaginations to work: 

Step 1) Imagine a semipermeable membrane with a tendency to curve into microspheres. 

Step 2) Imagine as whatever is permitted to pass accumulates inside the microsphere which then grows.

Step 3) Imagine that as the surface area increases, variations of its properties occur, and these areas grow too.

Step 4) Imagine that one day the membrane fragments.

Step 5) Imagine that as some fragments curve into new microspheres they would contain a concentration of the material that had been in the Mother Sphere, plus some stuff from the ambient that got surrounded just ‘cause it was there (and with perhaps most of the Mother Sphere's contents returned to the ambient).

Step 6) Return to Step 2, but now with more than one sphere.

evolution,e3yoz5,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.evolution,,Fallacies of Evolution,"Here is a list of fallacies for the Theory of Evolution (ToE) as it is commonly taught in schools.

False Equivalence. We can observe simple variability within an organism. Colored moths adapt to changing tree bark. Rabbits adapt to their surroundings. This is an observable, repeatable science, also known as 'micro evolution'. The fallacy is in making an equivalence between minor changes in physical traits, to extrapolating large changes in the genetic structure. That is NOT observed, &amp; cannot be tested. It is a false equivalence, to equate minor changes in micro evolution with the major ones in macro evolution.

Argument of Authority. 'All really smart people believe in the ToE.' This is not a scientific proof, but an argument of authority, as if truth were a democratic process. Real science must be demonstrated, via the scientific method, not merely declared by elites.

'Everybody believes this!' This is an attempt to prove something by asserting it is common knowledge. It is obviously not true, anyway, as many people do not believe in the ToE, in spite of decades of indoctrination from the educational system, public television, &amp; other institutions intent on promoting this ideology.

The infinite monkey theorem. 'Given enough time, anything is possible.' is the appeal here. If you have infinite monkeys, typing on infinite typewriters (lets update this to computers!), eventually you would get the works of Shakespeare, etc. This is an appeal to measure the ToE with probability, rather than observable science. We still cannot observe or repeat the basic claims of the ToE, so the belief that anything is possible, given enough time is merely that: A belief.

Ad Hominem. This is a favorite on the forums. If you cannot answer someone's arguments, you can still demean them &amp; call them names. It is an attempt to discredit the person, rather than deal with the science or the arguments.

Argument by Assertion. Instead of presenting evidence, assertions are repeated over &amp; over, as if that will make up for the impotence of the arguments.

Argument from Ignorance. This is claiming that evolution is true, because it has not been proven false. But the burden of proof is on the claimant, not the skeptic, to prove their claims. ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof"" ~Marcello Truzzi

Circular Reasoning. This is the argument that evolution is true, because we see all the variety of living things that have evolved. It is using the assumption of evolution to prove itself. Taxonomic classifications are often used in this manner.

Equivocation. This is similar to the false equivalence. It is using the terms 'evolution' when talking about variability within an organism, &amp; changing the context to macro evolution. It is comparing horizontal diversity in an organism to vertical diversity in the DNA. But one is obviously visible &amp; repeatable, while the other is not.

Correlation proves Causation. This attempts to use similarity of appearance (looks like!) as proof of descendancy. But morphological similarity can often display wide divergence in the DNA, with no evidence there was every a convergence.

Common  ancestry has not been demonstrated by scientific methodology, only asserted &amp; claimed. It is, in fact, a belief.. a religious belief in the origins of living things. It is an essential element for a naturalistic view of the universe, &amp; for that reason, it is defended (and promoted) with jihadist zeal. But it is too full of logical &amp; scientific flaws to be called 'science'. It is a philosophical construct, with very shaky foundations. There are too many flaws in the theory of universal common ancestry, regarding dating methods, conjectures about the fossil record, &amp; other conflicts with factual data.

Why are logical fallacies the primary 'arguments' given for the theory of universal common descent, if it is so plainly obvious and 'settled science!', as the True Believers claim?",30,1575130173,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e3yoz5/fallacies_of_evolution/

evolution,e3lti6,tkondaks2,,t2_36gw6h7u,self.evolution,,Giant Pandas on 60 Minutes: survival of the strongest,"A recent [episode](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/giant-pandas-saving-the-giant-panda-from-extinction-60-minutes-2019-10-27/) of 60 Minutes featured a facility in China in which scientists were raising pandas in order to introduce them into the wild to help stave off that species' decline towards extinction. 

What struck me was what one of the scientists said about twins (from the transcript of the show found in the above link):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;About half the time, pandas have twins but the mother can't care for both.  
&gt;  
&gt;Marc  Valitutto: In the wild, the smaller, the weaker twin will be left off  to die, because the mother doesn't have enough energy to produce the  amount of milk that's required for two babies.  But in captivity, twins are fed in the nursery and, with a touch, mom is  called to duty, to nurse the twins one at a time so both survive.  

The non-survival of the weaker twin is confirmed by the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda#Reproduction) on Giant Pandas. And this characteristic of Panda evolution is a result not of man's interference but as a naturally occurring phenomenon. And there is no reason to assume that this hasn't been going on for thousands if not tens of thousands of years.  Thus, the current Panda genome is a result of this particular type of selection: 50% of the time Pandas have twins and of those, only half survive. That means that virtually 25% of all Pandas that are birthed are selected against, even before any other types of selection may happen.

But those raised in captivity -- to ultimately be introduced back into the wild -- *all* survive by virtue of man's interference (albeit a well-intentioned interference). That is, 25% of all those introduced back into the wild are pandas that otherwise would have been selected against by virtue of the natural forces of evolution.

Is this wise?  I know this sounds heartless for me to say, but if ""nature"" -- for lack of a better word -- has seen fit to select against the weaker twin, why wouldn't the scientists at least try to mimic what nature has evolved to and not let the weaker twin survive in the facility setting? 25% is a huge number, isn't it, to introduce into a population a genetic characteristic (whatever it may be) of non-survivability.

It's the same question I have had for those well-meaning individuals whom we see on the news desperately trying to shove beached whales back into the ocean.  Certainly, we all love whales and it is a horrible thing to see dozens of whales beaching themselves, going towards a miserable death on the sand when they could be frolicking in the waves for us to see from our sight-seeing boats. But from what I've read, whales beaching themselves has been going on for as long as man has been observing whales...well before man polluted the oceans to any great effect.  So, like the abandonment of the weaker panda twin, the whale beaching is part of the evolution of the species, and some sort of selection process is going on.  Which means that beaching is a way for the whales to allow selection against genes that are not helpful to the survival of the species.

So are these two instances examples of unacceptable interference with nature?  Shouldn't we accept that death and destruction of certain members of a species is a *good* thing that we should respect and integrate into our attempts to help a species?",2,1575065181,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e3lti6/giant_pandas_on_60_minutes_survival_of_the/

evolution,e3gkr3,ahlearning,,t2_2psfgpn0,self.evolution,,[Letter],"## While introversion is usually not mentioned as a problem for standard evolutionary psychology, it should become clear that for any theory that assumes that females will have a preference for successful alpha males, introversion in males should be a puzzle. I have cursed my deep introversion many times in my life, not because I couldn’t reach for alpha positions, which I actually do not want, but because it has left me feeling like an omega male instead. I never was able to even make a big effort to try to impress a girl, because it actually feels “fake” for me, just like showing off with an expensive flashy car or a shiny new iPhone would feel “fake” for me.

For these reasons I had the feeling, I was a born “omega male” when I was a teenager. I wasn’t even interested in the usual stuff my teenage friends were interested in: cars, sports, and hanging out in clubs.

Later, at university when I came across Evolutionary Psychology, I used the following explanation for girls who complained about guys to me: females get exactly those guys who the previous female generations chose to mate with. So, there is not much reason to complain about guys whose genes were actually chosen by females.As true this actually is, there is an important detail missing here. Not all girls go for alpha males. Not because they can’t get one, but because their genes are programmed not to want one in the first place. They prefer nice and intelligent guys to muscle-flexing sporty guys. At university, I met quite a lot of girls, who seemed to be happy with introverted, geeky “omega males” like me. And in my 30s I finally found the girl who would be happy to get married to me.What does this mean for evolutionary psychology? It means that instead of postulating one general mating strategy it there should be at least two opposing mating strategies with many shades in between. In general, the girls who start to have sex earlier are more interested in the alpha males, whereas the girls who tend to start sex later prefer “partners in child-rearing” (alloparenting), who are actually less sexually dimorphic.

But it feels counter intuitive the fact that melanin is dark, as it will have its function under the sun, and a darker color is actually merely the property of the material absorbing more light spectra, whereas lighter color reflect more spectra.

Hence, too much melanin will make you hotter in a hot climate, even tho it is blocking the bad UV rays.

So what's the catch here?

I was thinking the following: would it be possible to selectively breed hamsters in a controlled enviroment (choosing the smartest individuals from each generation over and over) to obtain something with the intelligence of a chimp, or even a human? How long would it take? If the hamster/human generations have a relation of 1 day to 1 year, it means that the hamster evolution would be 365 times faster than the human evolution, and human evolution took 2 million years in a natural enviroment to get from australopithecus to homo sapiens. Translate that into hamster time, and 2 million years of natural hominid evolution translate into something of 5.400 years of natural hamster evolution. Take that natural evolution to a controlled enviroment where you take only the smartest individuals and breed them... how long would it take until we have Brain trying to conquer the world?

And from biological species concept, I understand that organisms that interbreed naturally are belonging to a single species but often organisms that are not able to do this might just be having a rejection mechanism that prevent fertilization but could be artificially induced even when it is restricted.

So I come to the conclusion that two species are truly apart when even when you are able to fertilize the gametes somehow it will no develop into an offspring ?

Is such a conclusion possible ? And what about asexually reproducing organisms like bacteria ?
Then it might be more related to their DNA right ?
Then at what point does changes in genome make an organism that is inherently different than its relatives ?",5,1574862082,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e2g5o3/the_concept_of_species/

I've been chewing on this topic for a while, and am curious if people have insight on how the professionals handle this type of scenario. From what I know the result is generally ""a bunch of competing hypothesis are formed, we set a lower level of confidence then for a fossil set with a lot of samples, and move on with our lives"" but I was curious if there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, let's say we have a hypothetical triceratops that has all of the hallmarks of being fully grown, but is vastly smaller then any identified triceratops species. When handling this kind of data, you could conclude that it's a new species that is much smaller, perhaps due to something like island dwarfism. You could also conclude that it has some kind of genetic mutation that made it vastly smaller then most of the members of it's existing species, and that it falls in one of the identified categories. Or perhaps we've mis-identified the hallmarks of it being fully grown and this was an infant. Or perhaps the second idea is true, but it's also from a new species and has a mutation. What are the tools we use to try and differentiate between these kinds of conclusions when working off of a sole data point?",17,1574815064,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e27ogs/when_dealing_with_archaeological_evidence_of_a/

evolution,e14lf6,TryingToForgetPi,,t2_1spyxihm,self.evolution,,Odd Species Out,"So something I've been thinking a lot about recently is the idea of the ""odd species out"" from any three currently existing species in the sense of which animal ""split"" evolutionarily from the other two the earliest. In other words, which animal is excluded by the other two having a shared common ancestor that it does not. Thinking about this can lead to some pretty weird answers which I like to tell people as they usually don't believe me untill I show them on a simplified version of the animal family tree. Some of my favourites are:

\-Out of a great white shark, a clownfish and an elephant, the great white shark is the odd one out, as cladistically the elephant and the clownfish are both descended from some kind of bony fish whereas the great white is not (it's in the cartaliginous fish group instead). This also works for any shark, any bony fish (most typical fish) and any tetrapod (any amphibian, reptile, mammal or bird). The shark will always be the odd one out.

\-Out of a lizard, a crocodile and a penguin, the lizard is the odd one out, as the crocodile and the penguin are both in the group ""archosauria"" whereas the lizard is in the group ""lepidosauria"" (These are the two groups which comprise all reptiles). Another way to look at it is that the ancestors of lizards split from the common ancestor of crocodiles and dinosaurs (and by extension birds). This also works for any lizard or snake along with any crocodile, dinosaur, bird or pterosaur. The snake or lizard will always be the odd one out.

\-Finally we have a salamander, a lizard (again) and a blue whale. Strictly speaking the salamander is in fact the odd man out, as the lizard and the blue whale have a common ancestor which the salamander does not - the first amniote (reptiles/mammals/birds). 

Some clarifications: I understand that genetically and physically, a great white shark and a clownfish are much more similar to one another than either are to an elephant. When I say ""odd one out"" I am strictly referring to the evolutionary tree of life and common ancestors. Also, this way of thinking is only really valid when discussing currently existing species, as referring to an extinct species kinda cheats the system as the species has less time to evolve. 

My actual question is, are there any other good examples of this that people can come up with? For some reason I find this particular misleading concept really interesting.",5,1574629225,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e14lf6/odd_species_out/

evolution,e0f1op,paroxsitic,,t2_ftnwl,self.evolution,,Humans have hit a brick wall with hyper-evolving to the next stage,"Evolution is a tricky thing to predict when you are leading the charge. Humans do not know how to evolve. Imagine our chimpanzee-like ancestors when they were leading the evolution trail; how could they predict their hyper-evolution would become homo sapiens who progressed to understand concepts from tools to mathematics and the brink of quantum physics enlightenment? Our ancestors couldn't predict that they would become what we are today, and it is for that reason why we cannot predict what we will become tomorrow. However, I had an epiphany about what is preventing us from evolving and it has to do with 2 important problems we know of today.

During this epiphany, a series of events led me to thinking about how computing is reaching a point where we are abstracting away the idea of computing by further computing (See: Kubernetes). The human race is stuck in a P!=NP world-view and we are hitting the boundaries of that limitation. We are just now figuring out how to use big data to train a model and utilize machine learning concepts, and it won't be long in terms of an evolution time-scale where we have discovered some form of artificial intelligence. If we were to prove that P=NP (or solve a NP-complete problem in polynomial-time), mathematics and computing as we know it would instantaneously and dramatically change. I propose when a life-dedicated mathematician finally unlocks the secret, nay, understanding of how to prove P=NP that this moment in history would be the dawn of Homo sapiens’ level 9000. Quantum computing would be child’s play if we suddenly were able to solve all NP-complete problems in polynomial-time. Our understanding of new mathematics, diseases, quantum physics, biology, chemistry and language would sky-rocket and each enhancement would help re-enforce others. Language in particular is an important problem to solve, as it’s the basis of understanding others and having others understand us. Artificial intelligence is hindered by our lack of understanding from language and super-advances in computing will us get closer to unlocking the secrets of language (See: AI’s Language Problem). Before this discovery, if we had not already figured out how to create actual artificial intelligence it would not be soon after this moment in evolutionary time.

That brings me to my 2nd important problem, how are we going to deal with an intelligence that will surpass us exponentially out of nowhere? (see: Singularity - Humanity's last invention). An important figure in human history is living today and is self-aware of this impending conflict that may lead to our extinction. Elon Musk has been outspoken about this topic and has urged world leaders to pay attention but to no avail. He has taken matters into his own hands and has started the effort to use brain implants to start merging with AI (See: Neuralink). Musk has gone on to realize that if you can’t beat them, join them and there are numerous videos of him admitting this. Look at how human history is being written about him on Wikipedia already ""technology entrepreneur, investor, and engineer"". These roles in our time are the most important ones. Elon Musk is just as much of a historical influencer as Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla, and Sir Isaacs Newton of their day. We should listen to him and heed his advice carefully, for he may be the key for us to unlock P=NP.

If you think P=NP is probably wrong then I encourage you to look at human history and how we are always in a mind-box, until someone frees us. I hope the life-dedicated mathematician I mentioned about will see this post and be inspired to think outside the box, or at the least we form a community that is to become a society based around the philsophy of Jacque Fresco.

There are theories about it being better for using the hands and what not, but there is a much more interesting theory I would love opinions on. I forgot what he called it so I will just called it the ""Dam that's cool"" theory. So basically, this is based on sexual selection and the evolutionary purposes of ""Cool"". This may be a crude interpretation of what he said but I will try. So basically, one early ape decided to start walking around on two legs for whatever reason and the rest of female apes where like ""Dam that is Cool"", So that ape got lots of pussy. This continued within the ape culture with those apes who were good at and more prone to walk upright getting more ape pussy until eventually it is ingrained in the genetics and it probably also provided a better survival chance. This may illustrate the power of sexual selection in evolution.  

This ""Cool"" maybe an extension of sexual selection because it is spread across the male and female culture, or maybe I am off and it is exactly the same. 

This is Dawkin's Idea or one he heard about so take it up with him if you think it is ridiculous. 

So what do you think about this and what do you think are the evolutionary purposes of ""cool""? What other traits could arise from such sexual selection (besides big wangs)?

I think this theory also gives support to the Stoned ape hypothesis in that the stoned apes would be more apt to use language (via synesthesia) which could be the catalyst to greater intelligence and culture. Abstract and lateral thinking may also have led to art and things we classify as uniquely human. These psychedelic apes may have gotten more ape pussy as well and psychdelia thus may be a fundamental aspect of being human. Just a thought. A big criticism of this theory is ""How could taking a drug cause an evolutionary change?"" Well its because ""Dam it is Cool"". I am not saying I believe the Stoned ape theory but I would not be surprised if it is true.",15,1574478733,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/e0c6bu/dam_thats_cool_bipedal_walking_and_the_stoned_ape/

I've wondered for some time, if-since our atmosphere is composed of roughly 78.09% nitrogen, 20.96% oxygen and various other gases-we could over time, force our bodies to adapt to an atmosphere consisted of more nitrogen as opposed to one of oxygen? 

Say we were to make a giant enclosed environment. One where we could first use on monkeys for testing purposes. In this enclosed environment we could alter the internal atmosphere. Could we do this with all species of plants too? 

I don't know how drastic it would be if our world's oxygen in our atmosphere, went from 20.96% to 20.95% and 78.09% to 78.1% oxygen. Or maybe even less. Instead of a tenth, then a hundredth. 20.965% to 20.964% oxygen and add a counter of nitrogen. 

Could we slowly speed up the rate at which biological life forms of earth can survive in different atmospheres? To allow for us to live on other planets easier/faster?

evolution,dunv4d,AbjectPride,,t2_w9isykr,self.evolution,question,Is it possible for convergent evolution to give rise to another species with human-like intelligence/sapience?,"So I learned about the troodontidae, a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs that had many similar features to humans including binocular vision, a somewhat omnivore diet, and a claw mechanism that functioned similarly to an opposable thumb. They were considered to be one of the most intelligent dinosaur species, even though they compare unfavorably to modern-day avian species.

Now, realistically speaking, it is **unlikely** the troodontidae would've evolved into a species of similar intelligence to a human being. However, the existence of evolutionary traits geared towards intelligence appear in multiple non-primate species, including the delphinidae (dolphins and orcas), octupi, and crows. It brings up the question: how human does something have to be in order to have human-like intelligence?

Strict thermoregulation and high metabolism are necessary to keep the brain functional and fulfill its energy needs. Humans have some of the best temperature regulation functions in the form of sweating, which provides us with incredible endurance compared to other land-dwelling animals. Even without technology, we're considered quite energy-efficient among animals. These functions are missing in cold-blooded animals, so is it impossible to for them to develop human-like intelligence?

Is it possible for another species to undergo convergent evolution and develop the intelligence to communicate with humans on a sophisticated level, or is our primate nature the only thing capable of reproducing our intelligence?",51,1573450312,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dunv4d/is_it_possible_for_convergent_evolution_to_give/

evolution,du0hqo,portirfer,,t2_4zd53xnn,self.evolution,question,Evolutionary biology- Zahavi’s handicap principle.,"From what I have read, when it comes to sexual selection and attracting females for mating, in some species males evolve costly handicaps to indicate that they must be better at surviving than males without handicaps, and I don’t understand how.
 I understand that males with handicaps in general would be more competent (at surviving) if  their handicap were to hypothetically be removed compared to males that don’t have them at all, but since they actually DO have a handicap which impact their competence negatively it is not obvious that their “net competence” would be greater than a male without a handicap. Hence it’s not obvious which male a female should choose.

The only way I can see this working is if the cost of the handicap gives a higher cost to low competence males than high competence males. If we then compare a population of handicapped males and non-handicapped males, this would “clean out” the handicapped population of low competence males and leave high competence males in the population more or less the same.
As a female it would then make sense to choose a handicapped male because even if it means that the male would maybe be slightly less able to survive than without the handicap at least the risk of choosing a low competence male is much smaller.
Yet I don’t think I have read the argument expressed in this way.

Is this correct in any way? Am I missing something? What am I not getting?",5,1573327762,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/du0hqo/evolutionary_biology_zahavis_handicap_principle/

I was just hoping if anyone could explain to me why we were the only species to develop such powerful brains or could point me to an article that explains why. Something that doesn't sit right with me is that there doesn't seem to be any other evidence of another mammal or family that evolution has turned into a freak being capable of understanding its own evolution. For me there has always been sort of a balance between species in a habitat where multiple can strive. However in this case we're outliers who continue to improve and dominate the planet.

evolution,dt1u1z,LoremJesusIpsum,,t2_4i5gm8mi,self.evolution,discussion,Common mistakes made by people who knows some evolution,"Here are three that bother me a lot. Feel free to add more.

1. Evolution is not synonymous with natural selection

Natural selection is only one of the mechanisms that can lead to evolution. Evolution can also happen through drift, mutation, recombination, non-random mating, migration, etc. Furthermore, you can have natural selection without evolution. For example, if the trait under selection has no heritability, the offspring will have the same trait as their parents. 

2. There's nothing special about artificial selection

People over-stress the dichotomy between natural and artificial selection, probably because *natural* and *artificial* happen to be antonyms. In truth, artificial selection is just a subset of natural selection. Just because we humans got involved during the process doesn't make it special. Intention and directedness do not set the two apart. Humans likely started selective breeding long before we become aware of heritability, there are unintended by-products of artificial selection (e.g. tomato flavor), and there are fungus-growing ants that also selectively breed their crops. *On the Origin of Species* uses artificial selection as an entryway to natural selection not because they are different, but that they are the same. 

3. Species is a human construct

Defining species according to whether some group of individuals can interbreed with others is convenient for constructing the phylogenetic tree, which is a convenent tool for summarizing evolutionary history. But if you are trying to figure out whether two populations can breed, saying ""they can't breed because they are different species"" would be circular reasoning. In reality it's common to see partial reproductive barrier, and in practice people often use morphology to define species.",49,1573151164,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dt1u1z/common_mistakes_made_by_people_who_knows_some/

I would like some help with my attempt to write down the ultimate cause for biased reasoning.

The reason natural selection favored organisms with brains is that the brain improved the organisms’ ability to identify food, a mate, or danger. 

The brain grows smarter through associative learning. The smart brain quickly tries to match what it sees to what it “knows”. Jonathan Haidt calls this process “intuition”

 If the intuition is challenged, the advanced brain (the brain that has language) will reason a justification for his intuition. We are unaware how this justification process is highly biases and can be deeply flawed.",7,1572711486,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dqmd0t/i_would_like_some_help_with_my_attempt_to_write/

The above is a text file with a little evolutionary simulation I hacked out quickly to prove a point regarding how independent assortment of alleles allows for traits under selection to be promoted without dragging along other, non-adaptive traits. It doesn't include genetic linkage, which would slow things down, but its easy to see/show that recombination would allow for the same thing to happen given enough time. If someone really wants me to I could add it to the above simulation in a couple lines (basically make line 79 a little more complex where p1[0][0] gets inherited with p1[1][0] more often than p1[1][1] and etc for the other alleles dependent on the frequency of recombination)

It's just a python script that doesn't have any external dependencies, so you can just copy/paste it into a .py text file and run it like any other python script.

It's not much, but I figured a few people here might be interested in looking at it and tinkering with it.",11,1572560663,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dpv2vk/quick_and_dirty_simulation/

Humans gambling, hunting can be quite tedious with very random chances of success. The other thing about hunting is how you need to improve your abilities to become more successful, which is what becoming good at a hobby seems to emulate. I'm guessing that this is also why once a person succeeds at some aspect of their hobby they immediately need to find a new goal, much like soon after a hunt you need to try to get more food.

What I'm trying to connect would be the natural desires we have implanted in our brains and how to use those to find a career that would be enjoyable due to how it excites those parts of our brains that would make a job feel like more than a chore.

evolution,dlczdb,somethingintrinsic,,t2_16vel4,self.evolution,,Evolution and science,"I recently read a book called Why Evolution is True, a very interesting take on why evolution is both a theory and a fact. The arguments were cogent and persuasive. Going into the book I already thought that there was consensus in the scientific community that evolution produced all species, including humans. And that was/is good enough for me. After reading the book, I could see a case where the logic seems irrefutable, short of incorrect facts.

A read an article on creation dot com which refutes the book, arguing that in some cases, Coyne misrepresents the facts or draws incorrect inferences. The argument is snarky and in some ways annoying. I linked to it in my first post, but was auto-booted so I've removed the link, but it's by Woodmorappe, an ardent creationist.

My first reaction was to say, ""yeah, but the article is on creation dot com."" I'm trying to avoid that type of thinking and to understand the validity of the arguments against so that I can either change my mind or adequately refute them.

1. Does anyone know of other books they'd recommend highly on the topic? The book is ten years old. Are there any more modern ones that are similarly impactful?
2. Do you have specific thoughts about the points Woodmorappe makes in his rebuttal? (Sorry I can't link to it.)

A friend also recently shared a video from Prager University. I'm assuming I can't link to that either. In the video Doctor Stephen Meyer (Phd from Cambridge) claims there are two bigs gaps in evolution. The first is the Cambrian explosion. His argument is that there was a mini ""big bang"" over a 20 million year period which gave birth to many of the unique traits which species have today. He feels that this rapid ""appearance"" of so many species isn't compatible with how evolution is supposed to have worked. I found [this explanation](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/cambrian/#close) of the Cambrian explosion and why the author feels that it's not evidence against evolution. Do you have other thoughts or links which would help me and others like me to understand?

His second point, as I understand it, is that there are way too many nucleotide pairs in DNA to allow random mutations to cause large changes. Anyone understand his argument well enough to explain it? I'd also appreciate your thoughts if you think he's wrong.

Though they might be fun for you, ad hominem attacks of Doctor Meyer or Prager probably aren't helpful. :-)",13,1571720423,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dlczdb/evolution_and_science/

**Primates** \- Primates/apes use sign language right? so did they develop sign language which created verbal communication since sign languages ARE consider verbal, because you use signs to show the other person what you're talking about, and then they use signs back to show you the answer. **TLDR:** Observing the primate apes by Darwin shows they help us understand the **""FIRST""** communication structure of humans and where verbal communication comes from since sign language gestures contain words, sentences, etc? 

**Songbirds** \- Songbirds' Brains Provide Clues to Human Speech. They helped develop our human speech in language. Songbirds learn their songs just like humans learn language. **TLDR:** Songbirds were observed by Darwin and showed that they helped in origin of human language since they're like human babies who learn from start/scratch from their parent?

I have one nice example and it is bacterial ribosomal proteins.

evolution,dhzihq,jordanj011,,t2_4qx4o3wu,self.evolution,discussion,The Evolution of Family,"Seems like so much of male sexual problems are caused by high prolactin ie. fatigue after ejaculating, longer refractory period, dopamine antagonist (less positive emotions), higher SHBG (lower free testosterone). In females it serves an important role related to breasts and milk production. 

So why has nature added this female hormone into the male profile? (estrogen is also female hormone but it serves important functions with cholesterol levels, bone density, serotonin, among others).

Is it possible, evolution added this hormone to the male endocrine system to regulate a certain desired behaviour? By having a higher refractory period, lower levels of motivation post climax and fatigue, it could have given females the opportunity to bond and secure a male to look after their offspring, leading to the first steps towards the modern family unit. 

Thoughts?",4,1571097697,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dhzihq/the_evolution_of_family/
evolution,dhz4g1,jordanj011,,t2_4qx4o3wu,self.evolution,discussion,The Family Hormone,"If the concept of family rose from the very need to provide the genetic offspring with the greatest chance for survival. Testosterone’s role in this process would be in attraction and courtship. Unfortunately for the female, testosterone also plays a key role in the desire to reproduce with as many females as possible, the greater the number of sexual instances, the greater the odds of genetic survivorship. It makes sense to theorize that this caused a great deal of vulnerability for the female and the offspring. 

The male endocrine system consists of three primary sex hormones; testosterone, estrogen and prolactin. 
We know the importance of the former two but prolactin doesn’t seem to really serve a necessary function in males as it does in females. In males its a dopamine antagonist and increase refractory time. Why would nature have added this hormone to the male profile? Perhaps as an adaptation to provide the offspring with the best opportunity to survive?

Prolactin binds to SHBG; a hormone that locks up testosterone and blocks dopamine receptors to produce a feeling of fatigue and increased refractory time. Having no urge to move onto another female and feeling the slowing effects of prolactin, the male may have been more likely to stay with the female and their offspring; providing the female the key opportunity to use the effects of oxytocin for bonding and perhaps initiate the first steps towards what’s today known as a family unit.

evolution,dh9dkh,IndieGameMasterRace,,t2_3sizt87d,self.evolution,,Hypothesis of Language development.,"I would like to present a hypothesis on language development in human beings. I will space out the sentences in a list form to show the steps. I hypothesize these steps may have led to the formation of spoken language . 

1. Humanlike primates develop coordinated hands. 
2. Aformentioned party develops gestures to communicate with others. They are silent and thus help them coordinate their hunts and such.
3. Fire is something our ancestors learn to control. Because fire tends to repel other animals (notably and most importantly wolves, bears, and other animals that hunt them), we no longer need to be stealthy. In fact, loud sounds scare off certain animals. Perhaps this becomes understood, which leads to my next point. 
4. They learn to associate certain sounds with certain animals when we frighten them away or want to point them out to others. These become the first words. Words change over time as we know and when different groups go different ways, their language develops down a different path. 


Before I continue on to my hypothesis on how written developed, I'd like to ask how my spoken language hypothesis holds up in the scientific community. I'd like to note that I am under the influence of marijuana right now. Take what I say as buzzed ramblings but if these words hold some water, tell me.

evolution,dh8rqz,stonerjunkyandfreak,,t2_13wgd39a,self.evolution,question,Did Anyone Hear Tha Segment On NPR About Evolution Yesterday?,"So I just heard a little snippet of part of some show they were doing on evolution, and I hope someone could tell me the term for what they were talking about. I'm not a biologist so I guess I don't really have a right to say this, (although from what I heard the people they were interviewing were mostly in other scientific fields besides biology themselves) but it sounded like mystical bullshit and I was kind of disappointed in NPR as they normally have good science reporting. The few point I heard were basically this: Natural Selection is old and boring, and doesn't incorporate the ""beauty"" of the individual. Now obviously natural selection is not the only thing driving evolution, we've known that since Darwin and from my understanding things like genetic drift play quite a large role, but the interviewees were arguing that we need to incorporate ""subjective experiences"" of individual creatures into the theory of evolution. Basically, it seemed to me they were arguing, individual choices of females play a greater role than anything else, and they went beyond sexual selection to argue that even a female worm might have preferences of one type of male over another, and this is where my bullshit meter started really ringing. Obviously higher creatures such as some types of birds have preferences based on decorative plumage of males, but they went beyond that in arguing that each female has ""individual preferences"" and this is actually the main driver behind the sexual selection, beyond the instincts of females to pick males with preferable traits. Of course, there will be variation, and once again I'm not a biologist, but this just seems highly erroneous to me, especially regarding less ""intelligent"" animals (pardon my use of this term, I know it's simplistic but you know what I mean). To use a thought experiment, say you have ten female ducks and 100 males, and the female ducks have complete choice over which mate to take. Are these people really arguing that most, if not all of the female ducks will have very similar preferences to choose the strongest males? Are they proposing that one of the female ducks will choose a small, deformed duck because she has ""individual preferences"" that cause her to go against her evolutionary instincts to choose a strong mate? (I don't know much about how ducks select mates so maybe this isn't the best example, but hopefully, you understand what I'm getting at.)

I know this is a bit rambly because I'm sort of confused, but I'm hoping someone can give me the term for what these people are describing. It seems extremely unscientific to anthropomorphize animals to such a degree that we need to incorporate the ""subjective experiences and individuality"" of animals into the theory of evolution. Of course, there is variation between individuals and preferences, but the main issue I have is with the idea that variations in individual preferences are stronger then instinctually choosing mates with desirable qualities in driving sexual selection. I can see this happening to a certain extent in the ""higher"" (once again pardon the term) mammals, but even wolves and chimpanzees clearly tend to choose certain types of mates, and it seems obvious to me that because this tendency is clearly stronger than variations in individual preferences, it would essentially cancel out those variations over time.",26,1570961744,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dh8rqz/did_anyone_hear_tha_segment_on_npr_about/

evolution,dgd2vn,Shitster67,,t2_qcth8,self.evolution,discussion,Effect of neutering stray dogs on their evolution and survival.,"Hey everyone. This is my first post here. And i just wanted to know your views on the topic.
In India, laws against animal abuse are not very strong. And there are cases where people harm the strays just for sadistic pleasure.
On the other hand, there are a lot of organizations that help getting stray dogs adopted. Now, some of these organizations also pick the strays up, neuter them, and again leave them in the streets. They feel that by neutering the dog, they are preventing the species from suffering as around 80% of the pups die before reaching the reproductive age.

However, i feel neutering them just because humans end up harming them (whether intentionally or not), is just a way to have a moral satisfaction that you're helping the strays. Neutering them disturbs the way they are supposed to be naturally. They produce many pups because they evolved that way to counter the death rate. And neutering them might just disturb the way it is supposed to be naturally.

I understand that neutering pets is sort of needed (not just for our convenience but also to prevent illegal breeding and selling of dogs) but neutering the strays seems harmful for the species.

PS: majority of the strays belong to 1 particular breed (indian pariah dogs) because people here are crazy for pure breeds. So if a labrador happens to be there in the streets, someone will end up taking it home. But not much people adopt indian pariah dogs.

Rebuttals to this argument had to do with the fact that not all behaviors can be seen this way (spandrels and etc.).

With my fairly limited knowledge of biology I’m curious. Isn’t it true that evolution is due to a mutation that made the organism have a advantage, that made him more favourable for reproduction and therefore continued the mutation. 

Therefore why is the population starting To be born without wisdom teeth. As most people don’t find the absence of it attractive why is it being reproduced enough that 30% of the population has this mutation. Why doesn’t it just stay as a random and rare mutation that is only among a few.

evolution,dda2hf,JaeHoon_Cho,,t2_15zrvw,self.evolution,,"Signaling, fitness, and competition.","So in movies or shows or what have you, the seasoned veteran of war/combat is almost always depicted with physical scars and wounds.

If one were to hypothesize who would win between this individual and another individual of similar size and stature who does not have this physical scarring, I think many would bet on the scarred individual, using the scars as indicators of past combats (and their presumed successes in these combats, assuming that only the victors come out alive).

This scarring serves as an honest signal of an individual’s fitness. Although, it’s possible that an individual with no scars could simply be one of exceptional skill (having had no injuries in all prior contests), I believe probability favors the explanation that this individual is simply a novice with no prior competitive engagements.

So my question is, are there real life, natural examples where scarring from competition acts as a signal of high fitness? I realize that competitions leading to death are rare amongst conspecifics, but I’d still like to know if such a dynamic could exist? Experience in combat evident by battle wounds could, in turn, be a signifier of age, which at a certain point works against the individual as well (i.e. if you have many scars, you have many years of experience; if you have many years of experience, you are likely older than your rivals; if you’re older than your rivals, you may be past your “prime”).",10,1570208157,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dda2hf/signaling_fitness_and_competition/
evolution,dcwxz6,nasadiya_sukta,,t2_lq7oi,self.evolution,,Evolution and Consciousness,"I put together my thoughts on how evolution gave us consciousness, and I don't really have an outlet for sharing them.  I was hoping /r/evolution might enjoy this.  I'm not going to say that they're revolutionary (different modules inside the circuitry), and I'm not going to deny there's a lot of gaps that are hand-waved around, but they connect the evolutionary pressure side of things with the cognitive science side of things in a way that I haven't seen done .  I'd love to hear others' feedback.

The article [can be found by clicking on this link.](https://edgeofthecircle.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ConsciousnessNotes.pdf)

Here's a summary:

1. Consciousness arises from evolution, and therefore is an adaptation that has an explanation in terms of evolutionary fitness. 

2. There is nothing that conscious beings can do that non-conscious ones (""zombies"") cannot. The evolutionary advantage is therefore in terms of doing the same things, but more efficiently. 

3. The human brain uses 20% of the calories of the body; being more efficient would therefore certainly be helpful. 

4. Evolution will optimize computational ability (proxy: the weighted average of the VC dimension, and the importance of each solution) with respect to a cost function (which is the energy spent in computation, possibly combined with the number of brain cells and/or the genetic information required to specify brain development). 

5. It is plausible under this constrained optimization, the neural network acquires a modular form. In particular it is more efficient if the higher order logic can be isolated into one module, and this module can be used for many different applications (the most important at any given time). Perhaps this behavior can be compared to the self-organization 2 that happens in other systems when we optimize for maximum entropy flow. 

6. This modularization is not useful unless we also have an overall module that sits on top and is able to evaluate which application gets to use the higher-order logic module at any given time. This module should be able to have access to all information in order to make this decision (introspection/qualia). 

7. Understanding and dealing with other humans, who are also trying to understand us, is one of the most important problems humans evolved to solve. Introspection is an important advantage in this. As humans grow more intelligent, this becomes a more and more difficult problem to model. 

8. As we are cooperative animals, the marginal advantage of intelligence keeps *increasing* as intelligence increases, in contrast to most other traits (such as the cheetah's speed or the peacock's tail). This leads to runaway increase in intelligence. 

9. As the system (in particular, the higher-order module or the control module) pushes towards higher intelligence, and approaches a critical level of complexity (some extension of Turing completeness or recursive logic), a phase transition happens and intelligence (as measured by the ability to solve a wide range of problems) increases extremely fast. 

10. The fact that neural networks are highly connected means that they are much less time-reversible than computers (the state is much more complex). Also, the fact that they contain some extension of Turing completeness/recursiveness means that they are less predictable (recursive looping is tougher to time-reverse). In connection with introspection, this leads to free will.",57,1570135654,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/dcwxz6/evolution_and_consciousness/

So I just learned about the ancient bacteria that was found to be the same today as it was 2 billion years ago. They ended up explaining how this happened summarized in this quote:

”The rule of biology is not to evolve unless the physical or biological environment changes, which is consistent with Darwin,"" said Schopf, who also is director of UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life. The environment in which these microorganisms live has remained essentially unchanged for 3 billion years, he said.”

https://m.phys.org/news/2015-02-scientists-hasnt-evolved-billion-years.html

I haven’t been able to find an answer to my question yet: 

How did the deep sea environment remain essentially unchanged over 2 billion years?! 

This means that the environment where this bacteria exists remained unchanged even through the break up of Pangea which I’ve seen is thought to be about 170 million years ago. During the break up, the ocean floors shifted, the whole earth rearranged and plates moved around. 

I have been trying to find other places in the earth where the environment also never changed over billions or even millions of years really. The claim is that this essentially living fossil has not evolved based on the “fact” that the environment “remained essentially unchanged for 3 billion years.”

So where is the evidence of certain environments remaining unchanged around the globe even through major climate shifts and the break up of Pangea and more?

It's said that theres only 100 of these parrots left in the wild.

I found this relatively interesting so I did a little bit of research (Mainly to see what it looks like) and I noticed that theres conservation efforts put in place to keep this species alive which then in turn made me ponder this question.

Now, I don't want to appear like a a douche here but haven't animals been going extinct for millions of years due to this type of issue? If an animal isn't able to adapt, And is unfit to survive the wild why not let them die out? Why is it so important to preserve these animals now? It is just completely pointless, But as humans we don't want species to go extinct? some other reason? 

I did a little research on this topic also, And the only real answers I got were 'The ecosystem is maintained by plants and animals' which I can understand but this doesn't go for all animals, right? I can understand that the loss of certain animals such as bee's would be a catastrophe but would the extinction of this parrot really cause a chain reaction of issues within the ecosystem?

evolution,d9qrrx,luscious__devil,,t2_3ertr4i9,self.evolution,,Evolutionary theory as a product of evolution,"There's a group of related questions/ideas that have been kicking around in the back of my head for the past few months regarding the notion of the human mind as a product of evolution, so I was just wondering what people here might have to say... I'm going to ask a few different questions below, but in my mind, they're all versions of the same question, which in perhaps it's purest form would be: Where do we stand when we judge the human mind to be entirely produced by natural forces that are contingent &amp; wholly undirected?

If the human mind is nothing more than a product of the evolutionary process, how can it know this? That is, if the brain really is the way that evolutionary accounts of neurology/biology tend to portray it -- i.e., a complex biological machine that in no way represents a reality outside of itself, that exists only because we are the descendents of creatures with brains who were able to reproduce, etc., etc. -- why would we think that that thing should be capable of accurately comprehending its own nature &amp; history? If our minds are simply the product of a chaotic, contingent process, shouldn't that immediately render all of our knowledge unreliable, including the very knowledge that lead to the conclusion that all of our knowledge is unreliable?

If, as Dennett, Hume, &amp; many others have claimed, religion should be viewed as a natural phenomena -- i.e., that the correct or most useful perspective on religion is one of natural history -- shouldn't we then need a natural history of all aspects or genera of human culture, &amp; if so, shouldn't we then also need a natural history of science, that is, a natural history of natural history? And if we could construct that, wouldn't we then need a natural history of the natural history of natural history? And so on, forever. In other words, it seems to me that any kind of account of human culture as a natural product or natural phenomenon must (a) become involved in the infinite regress I just mentioned, (b) simply fail to account for its own existence, or (c) reserve for itself some sort of special epistemological status that places it outside the realm of natural phenomena. (a) &amp; (b) are obviously two modes of failure, &amp; (c) seems to introduce precisely the kind of non-natural phenomena that the likes of Daniel Dennett are attempting to eliminate. Is there a way out of this?

Finally, it seems to me that if the physicalist/evolutionary/scientific materialist perspective is correct, that would mean that the chaotic, contingent process of evolution has, after billions of years, produced a cognitive mapping of its own history. That is, this utterly non-conscious, non-directed process has, produced the concept of itself &amp; of the mechanism of its own arising. Does that not seem like an extraordinary claim? The idea that all of life &amp; all human consciousness &amp; culture is the result of a blind mechanical process is startling enough, but the idea that that process (or parts thereof, i.e., individual humans) has become not only aware of itself as a process, but has actually produced accurate models of its own history &amp; nature seems to me utterly incredible. It seems, at least prima facie, that we really should not expect a process of that nature to be able to accurately model itself. How do we account for the fact that the process of evolution gives rise to an accurate theory of evolution?

I could go on, but I'll stop there. I hope it's easy to see how all of that is really just a single question as to the philosophical ground or place of enunciation from which evolutionary claims are made...",3,1569535508,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/d9qrrx/evolutionary_theory_as_a_product_of_evolution/

Every being fights for survival, (and/or values reproduction because it is promoting the continued existence of a being through it's offspring) because every being that has survived fears death. Why would we care to survive against death? Because death is the end of expression for an individual, the end of all cognitive processes, and why would we fear this? Because we have something to express, something in the essence of our being, something in the genes we hold, if you will. What is this something? This something is the way we express the truth each of us holds in how we view the world, our perception. We fight to express and prolong the expression of this truth we are capable of perceiving. This desire leads to a war we call survival of the fittest, where beings fight endlessly to survive and prolong survival of their species. Now, once a fit has been chosen, it can live long enough to express said truth, and then pass on that truth to it's offspring, but a life of violence is meaningless, for the fit realizes that violence is the suppression of the truth of another, and the surpession of the truth every being strives to get closer to. Thus the true purpose of all beings is coexistence between their existence and the existence of others, where all beings can express their truth and learn from the truths of others. Coexistience is only possible through morality. Thus, morality's ability to help a animal evolve helps its case that it is essiential to our true nature, which is akin to a piece of a painting that strives exist long enough to be expressed, realized and added to a larger picture of understanding.",27,1569528631,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/d9p4sm/hey_looking_for_people_to_point_out_flaws_in/

She doesn't really make any strong arguments and it's exploratory by nature.

Anyway, from what I have read there are quite a few theories that ancient humans were monogomous, which is explained by dymorphism and oxytocin which bonds humans after sex with each other.

However, I also noticed that there are several theories that allude to humans have polyamorous tendencies. For example, male sperm is 'built' to compete against rival sperm inside the female, and male penises are shaped in a way that they can 'scrape out' rival sperm. 

So because of this, there a few theories that a female would have several mates. She may have mated with several males and kept one man close by to help rear her children (which I guess is cuckolding). There is also a theory that if men didn't know who HIS children were, he just helped out with all women in his tribe. This would encourage pro-social behaviour, as anyone could potentially be your child. It also means that a women's children had diversity in genes, and with that brought different strengths to the table.

But my question is this: Wouldnt these polyamorous tribes be a nightmare for inbreeding? If you don't know who your father is, anyone your age could potentially be your half sibling.

evolution,d8mhcl,futurebassisdead,,t2_4eswe8sc,self.evolution,question,Hi r/evolution. I've some questions about evolutionary concepts that have been bugging me for a while and unfortunately Google hasn't yielded much result.,"If I'm not mistaken the basis of the evolutionary process is mutation yes? I'd like to ask why and how mutations occur. I'm confused about this mainly because I've heard two conflicting explanations for it : 

The first is that mutation is an attempt at adaptation caused by environmental stimuli, for example giraffes' necks getting progressively longer due to their stretching their heads up to get at tree leaves. 

The second is that mutation occurs completely randomly and that if an organism is born with a beneficial mutation instead of a detrimental one, that mutation is brought about totally by chance. As in, a giraffe born with a longer neck had an inherent advantage over shorter specimens and survived better, passing on the ""long-neck mutation"" until the entire giraffe population consists of long-necked specimens. 

My questions are :
1. Is mutation something an organism is born with, or can it be caused by external changes? Were the giraffes born with longer necks, or did they stretch them so they became longer and passed on that trait? 

2. I read somewhere that a percentage of baby elephants in different regions are now being born without tusks, apparently as a protection measure against ivory poachers. My question regarding this is, if mutation is random how can the same mutation happen simultaneously in different specimens, and if mutation is completely random(or without defined purpose) what leads biologists to posit the above mutation is a protection measure? This probably sounds kind of ignorant but it's not like the elephants realized their tusks were the reason they're being hunted and consciously induced a mutation to stop the next generation from having tusks right?

3. Lastly (I have more questions about the second explanation for mutation because it seems to be the leading theory) if a random mutation causes a beneficial trait, how does each generation make that trait progressively more pronounced? We see how giraffes got longer necks over time. They didn't go from a ""normal"" neck length and *schloop* just went all spaghetti neck in one generation. If mutations are random how did these slightly-longer-necked giraffes keep developing that long-necked trait to get the current giraffe anatomy?

evolution,d8f7sy,actualyserious,,t2_4e1mi6yg,self.evolution,,Question on the evolution of complex systems,"Ever since learning about evolution, I've not really understood how the evolution of complex systems work on a smaller scale.  The concept of survival of the fittest and natural selection make complete sense to me.  The question I have is regarding what the actual generational iterations look like leading up to a complex system.

For example, at one point fish evolved to have legs to be able to walk on land (I'm sure this is a borderline offensive oversimplification, but please humor me for the purpose of this question).

If you were to trace back this advantageous trait to the very first generation of fish in which you could see the beginnings of the mutations necessary for functional legs, what would you see?  Would it be:

1. A fish with a completely nonfunctional mutation (e.g. 1 out of 100 necessary mutations for the trait, but that provides the fish with no benefit)?  or
2. A fish with some very simple mutation but one that is actually functional and therefore there would be pressure for?

The problems I have thinking about each one of these are:

1. If the first traces of all the necessary mutations for a functional, advantageous trait are nonfunctional, then they would not be selected for.  They would need to get passed down to subsequent generations just by random chance (since there would be no evolutionary pressure), and then future generations would need to compound on those nonfunctional mutations with more nonfunctional mutations until eventually a fish actually presented with enough mutations to actually have a functional advantage.  This whole time there would be a big risk that the nonfunctional mutations would disappear, because there would be no actual pressure for them.
2. If the very first fish with the traces of the mutations for legs did actually have a functional advantage, it seems like it would require so many mutations that it would be unlikely to all be able to happen at once.

**TLDR** \- If we looked at the first generation with mutations to which a complex system could be traced, would the individual with the mutation(s) have a small functional trait, or would there be generations of organisms with non-functional mutations passed down without pressure before enough mutations compounded to give rise to the functional trait?

I have looked around this sub to try to find the answer and I came across some posts that touch on this but they were generally asked by creationists trying to make the Irreducible Complexity argument so everyone was a bit defensive and I didn't get a really clear answer.  Please note that I do not doubt at all that evolution exists, I'm just trying to understand this better.

As many of us know, Corals are suffering from Ocean acidification (OA) due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2).(1)  But when looking at concentrations of CO2 (2) from when modern corals first evolved (\~240 mya - middle Triassic period) (3,4) is practically four times higher than it is in the modern day. (2)  

If this is all true then corals must have had some way to deal with higher levels of carbonate in the ocean water, as they still used mineralized skeletons made of calcite or aragonite much like modern corals. (3)  So I'm just wondering, what conditions would encourage corals to lose their resilience to lower pH?

evolution,d6l2dd,Mynameistowelie,,t2_2tf9mhc4,self.evolution,,My journey into Mental Evolution.,"2 Years ago, I started my journey into mental evolution and just wanted to share my story and progress. 

I was an individual who was a slave to my mind and my emotions. Ask yourself an honest question, do you control your mind or does your mind control you? 

A perfect example is self discipline which is simply doing what you said you were gonna do, when you said you were going to do it, wether you feel like it or not. 

Also cared too much what about what other people think, always rationalizing my actions and faked my confidence throughout most of my life. 

I was the person who looked down or stared at my phone when you passed by because I felt too uncomfortable making eye contact. 

Well all that changes when I utilized all my mental resources and things I’ve learned through psychology when trying to cure my OCD, which I actually did without any help or prescription from doctors. 

Here’s how I did it: 

I knew that everything in life is all about habit. 
No one is born lazy, no one is born a procrastinator, no one is born with a lack of self discipline or motivation, unless you were predisposed to some type of mental illness. 

I decided to implement a habit of meditation to always be thinking with a clear head and developed a habit of being comfortable with being uncomfortable. 

I did this everyday for 2 years and long story short, here are my results:

Whenever a negative thought pops up, even my OCD, I can now disregard any thought or emotion with a snap of a finger. 

Examples: 

Starting thinking about an ex, that’s a negative and unhelpful thought, was a toxic relationship anyways, snap. Thought cleared. 

Staring reminiscing about embarrassing things or mistakes and regrets I did in the past. We can’t change that, so instead I take it as a learning lesson and  improve what I can in this present moment. Snap. Thought cheated. 

OCD telling me that my stove is on and it will burn the house if I don’t check, That’s an irrational thought and not real, Snap OCD thought gone. 

Just like Thanos, I have gained the ability of the infinity stones of the mind, and with the snap of a finger, I now decide my own thoughts, my actions and future. 

I must be resilient and only give myself a maximum of 2 days to feel down on a any given negative emotion. 

I can say that by creating good thinking  habits through meditation and self discipline  I’ve never been been happier. 

I can finally control my emotions and thoughts, at the snap of a finger. :)",3,1568930468,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/d6l2dd/my_journey_into_mental_evolution/
evolution,d6k2gb,ahlearning,,t2_2psfgpn0,self.evolution,,A possible evolutionary orign of introversion,"### While introversion is usually not mentioned as a problem for standard evolutionary psychology, it should become clear that for any theory that assumes that females will have a preference for successful alpha males, introversion in males should be a puzzle. I have cursed my deep introversion many times in my life, not because I couldn’t reach for alpha positions, which I actually do not want, but because it has left me feeling like an omega male instead. I never was able to even make a big effort to try to impress a girl, because it actually feels “fake” for me, just like showing off with an expensive flashy car or a shiny new iPhone would feel “fake” for me.

For these reasons I had the feeling, I was a born “omega male” when I was a teenager. I wasn’t even interested in the usual stuff my teenage friends were interested in: cars, sports, and hanging out in clubs.  


Later, at university when I came across Evolutionary Psychology, I used the following explanation for girls who complained about guys to me: females get exactly those guys who the previous female generations chose to mate with. So, there is not much reason to complain about guys whose genes were actually chosen by females.As true this actually is, there is an important detail missing here. Not all girls go for alpha males. Not because they can’t get one, but because their genes are programmed not to want one in the first place. They prefer nice and intelligent guys to muscle-flexing sporty guys. At university, I met quite a lot of girls, who seemed to be happy with introverted, geeky “omega males” like me. And in my 30s I finally found the girl who would be happy to get married to me.What does this mean for evolutionary psychology? It means that instead of postulating one general mating strategy it there should be at least two opposing mating strategies with many shades in between. In general, the girls who start to have sex earlier are more interested in the alpha males, whereas the girls who tend to start sex later prefer “partners in child-rearing” (alloparenting), who are actually less sexually dimorphic.

evolution,d6jxea,ahlearning,,t2_2psfgpn0,self.evolution,,The evolutionary psychology of love and personality types: r/K selected mating strategies according to subsistence economy,"Evolutionary psychologists have been pointing out the problems with our monogamous laws do not correspond to the more promiscuous human nature. The biggest problem, however, has been explaining the variation in human behavior, as some people are clearly more monogamous than others.

So, instead of assuming one monolithic human nature it makes more sense to investigate mating strategies by personality type. [Helen Fisher](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oprah.com/relationships/finding-your-soul-mate-helen-fishers-formula-for-romance/all&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566311635983000) has just done that (quite successfully IMHO), and found out that there are four personality groups and three preference strategies: builders (traditional, family-oriented), explorers (freedom-loving) - both of who prefer to find partners within their respective groups - and directors and negotiators who prefer to bond with each other. Whereas Helen Fisher thinks that these personality types have been present more or less equally since early humans arrived on the scene, I think that their “genotypes” have been predominant in accordance with a  particular subsistence economy.

Hunter-gatherers are usually highly monogamous. Sexual dimorphism (a sign of promiscuity) is largely diminished among hunter-gatherers, both compared to early human ancestors and modern societies (e.g exaggeration of secondary sexual features and digit ratio.

With increasingly longer onset of puberty (K selection), hunter-gatherers needed increased parental investment, not only maternal but also paternal and from relatives (grandmother hypothesis) and friends (alloparenting, see [Sarah Hrdy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Nature-Maternal-Instincts-Species/dp/0345408934&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566311635983000)). So, monogamy became the norm, making our ancestors more similar to penguins than our close ape relatives, as far as mating strategy is concerned. 

With the advent of farming and pastoralism status could be acquired with the accumulation of more material reproductive resources polygamy started to creep in (which might have been in both male and female interests). As there was less paternal insecurity among farmers, early farming societies actively tried to discourage polygamy (e.g. code of Hammurabi), which made pastoralist societies the ones with the highest degree of polygamy.

The following personality types correspond well with Helen Fisher's types (as well as Myers-Briggs types):

evolution,d5960q,EmpoweredHealth,,t2_24ysy9mu,self.evolution,,"How grandmothers are essential to societies, as explained by anthropologist Kristen Hawkes","In 1989, a team of anthropologists studying Hadza hunter-gatherers in northern Tanzania noticed how hard one particular group was working: the grandmothers.

“They were well into their sixties and their productivity was just as great as the women who are still in the childbearing years,” said Kristen Hawkes, one of the anthropologists involved.

Hawkes, now a professor at the University of Utah, has been studying human evolutionary biology– how life develops and adapts over time– for decades. She and her collaborators are credited with the data collection that backed up the grandmother hypothesis, widely considered one of the most important theories in modern evolutionary biology. The theory, originally proposed in the mid-60s’, concludes that grandmother's help is crucial to human longevity.

We produce a show called [Empowered Health](https://empoweredhealthshow.com/ep-22-whats-happening-to-my-body-the-run-up-to-menopause/), a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode with Kristen Hawkes on how crucial the grandmother hypothesis has been for human evolution and how this concept plays out in the Western world. We now understand post-menopausal women are essential for so many aspects of society, and we wanted to share the scientific evidence to back that notion.

The evidence Hawkes’ team gathered displayed how grandmothers' assistance with childcare and providing a stable and consistent source of food gave mothers more time and energy to reproduce and kept the community well-nourished during times when the men were unsuccessful at hunting large game– which was frequently the case. With grandma foraging– something young grandchildren are too small to be successful at– the children were more likely to survive.

The older grandma lived, the more children her daughter would have. Those offspring would inherit a survival advantage, passed on generation after generation through stronger genes and greater chances at nourishment. No wonder grandma is always trying to get you to finish your plate.

Today, we have so many different family structures, some of which do not involve having children, and we thought this topic was especially important, because it shows us that so much of what we’ve been told or taught about our value in society is not the full story. While the grandmothers in these hunter and gatherer societies served this essential function in their communities, supplying stable sources of food and helping with childcare, today we have women accomplishing important things for society outside the realm of reproduction too. In those societies, the opportunities were clearly defined and limited. In our society, post-menopausal women have the chance to radically alter their roles, to take on incredible responsibilities and help our entire society. When your children leave the nest, much like those grandmothers in these hunter-gatherer societies, you have a chance to drive massive impact if you want to.

evolution,d3xj65,coolmesser,,t2_100d89,self.evolution,discussion,Is human intelligence natural?," 

I have always been under the impression that life pretty much HAD to exist on some other planets if it existed here. This planet is such a minute speck in the universe that it can't be the only port of conscious life. Or can it? Enter NOTCH2.

NOTCH2 is a particular gene sequence in chromosome 1. Its' purpose is to create an enzyme that allows stem cells to keep replicating themselves instead of differentiating and splitting. This gives it control over the base population of neuron glial cells that will subdivide and populate the cortex. It regulates neuron density in the brain.

Somewhere around 14.5 million years ago (MYA) the NOTCH2 genome of the ancestor to ALL great apes replicated itself elsewhere on the chromosome. This isn't unusual and is how many genetic abnormalities begin. In this case the extra piece was merely a useless fragment. That fragment lingered around in the apes after orangutan split off and remained dormant for 11 million years.  


&amp;#x200B;

Once this ancestor split into apes, chimps, and hominids something special happenes. Around 3-4 MYA the extra NOTCH2 fragment copied over and repaired itself - creating NOTCH2NL which multiplied neuron density. From 3MYA to approximately 500,000 years ago NOTCH2 went on to spur 3 more active sequences on chromosome 1. These are known now as NOTCH2NLA,B, and C respectively. Each of them also increased man's neuron density appreciably.

Overall I have seen numbers ranging from a 4x to an 8x increase in neuron density as a result of the replication incidents. I believe the answer to man's consciousness lies there as does the fate of those ""probable"" alien life forms. Carbon-based intelligent life as we understand it may be more of a statistical oddity than we realized. It may actually not be possible absent the NOTCH2N incident.

evolution,d1ok27,Ahsinjii,,t2_pmdpg,self.evolution,question,Epigenetics contradicts evolution?,"Hi reddit, some time ago I ran into what I assume to be a pseudoscientific website 
http://sciencerefutesevolution.blogspot.com/
Is there any actual validity to what is frequently being espoused from the author?
The author frequently claims that genome degradation and epigenetics disprove evolution, that there are no recorded instances of “beneficial mutations” and that any variation between species is caused by epigenetic mechanisms, eg DNA methylation.

Here is a quote

“Because the DNA is just passive data base and it has to be activated by epigenetic mechanisms in order to have a purpose, it's obvious that all adaptation within organisms occurs through epigenetic mechanisms and factors = epigenome. Changing epigenetic profiles never result in any kind of evolution, vice versa. Changing methylation patterns often result in subtle genetic errors. That's why genetic degradation is a biological fact. This can be observed: There are 628,685 gene-disease-associations in human genome worldwide but the number of beneficial mutations is close to zero”

(For clarification, I am pursuing a science degree myself, with a major in biochemistry and molecular biology, but my education on epigenetics and genome degradation is fairly rudimentary at this point to say the least)

To my knowledge DNA methylation and histone de-acetylation induce transcription repression, and are some of the regulatory methods for gene expression, as every cell carries with it the entirety of the organism’s genome but doesn’t necessarily need to express every gene found within the genome.

Aren’t epigenetic regulatory mechanisms like transcription factors and methyltransferases themselves encoded by DNA, which would be subject to natural selection?

While I’m fairly certain that the site is nothing but pseudoscientific nonsense, I would still like to hear the opinion of those much more educated on the subject than myself.",23,1568021265,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/d1ok27/epigenetics_contradicts_evolution/

I have the same amount of males and females and they are easily told apart. Since the conditions in the tank are very favorable, males, chase females, attempting coitus.

evolution,d0ydt2,Traumlore,,t2_3eat1aev,self.evolution,discussion,Are Skyscrapers a Form of Fitness Signalling? Pet Theory of Mine,"Within evolutionary biology, signalling theory is a body of theoretical work examining communication between individuals, both within species and across species. Signals are given in contexts such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, at the risk of undermining the signalling system for the whole population.

One type of signalling in particular caught my attention. There is a thing called stotting, where antelopes in Africa will go out of their way to jump in the air while being chased by predators in order to what some believe signal to the predators how fit they are and how it would be a waste of time expending the energy to chase them.

So my pet theory here is this: Are skyscrapers a type of fitness signalling that businesses and cities (which are superorganisms I think) employ to show off to the world the fitness of their economies? A city that does not have a thriving economy will not waste resources directing them towards flashy skyscrapers. A city with a very robust and competitive economy can and will. In renaissance Italy we saw this as well, where wealthy businessmen and cities would end up constructing towers to make a sort of medieval skyscraper. Do you think it makes sense to consider skyscrapers to be a sort of fitness signal for corporations, and impressive skylines to be a fitness signal for cities?",3,1567874925,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/d0ydt2/are_skyscrapers_a_form_of_fitness_signalling_pet/

evolution,cyfpr2,dreamnightmare,,t2_butok,self.evolution,discussion,Theory of perpetual creation.,"Please tear this idea apart. It’s intent is to provoke thought. I personally look at this more of a shower thought I had. A really deep shower thought that isn’t good for r/showerthoughts. I just want someone to read it and either debate the possibility or rip it to shreds. 

We, (humanity) are a creation. Not by gods or by God. But by another creation before us. That creation was in turn created by another creation. It’s a real “turtles all the way down” sort of idea. At some point the initial creation was formed, I won’t be hypothesizing about the true formation of the cycle. Just that there is a cycle I believe we are currently working towards creating the next form of life that will be the next phase in the cycle. I believe this is going to be AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the form of automation, whether that be robots or something similar.

As of right now we are using technology to build robots of various shapes and sizes to do a variety of tasks. It started with simple machines. Robotic arms like the “Rancho Arm” at MIT were some of the first that we could call a “Robotic arm”. They were used for simple tasks and had a limited amount of movement. Sure, basic concepts of this were around for much longer. But for the purpose of this theory we will start here. After this we began to move further along and advanced further with the technology and gave the arms more and more tasks that could be accomplished. Eventually moving to the now commonplace items such as the Roomba or industrial robots and even toys. And if you were to look at Boston Dynamics who are taking it further with such things as a BigDog, WildCat, Spot and Atlas. Note how we are starting out. We are creating things that are around us and trying to recreate it in robotic form. Looking at Atlas, for example, it is an attempt to recreate humans. This will eventually lead to more and more complex and capable versions of the design. But what happens when that design combined with AI becomes sentient? Are we really so naïve as to believe that one day we will live and coexist in harmony with what is essentially a more powerful and smarter form of ourselves?

I believe what will happen, and this is all speculation intended to show my point, is we will one day advance our creation to a point that it will be able to advance on its own to procreate.

Our AI creations will begin to create and advance further without us and most likely in spite of us. Think about the machines from the Terminator franchise. We didn’t create the T-800. The machines did. It was an advancement beyond what we expected. And then they advanced further with the T-1000. If you think we could ever truly stand a chance against a smarter, stronger and faster creation, you are sadly mistaken. The likelihood is they will usurp humanity and eventually destroy us. And then they will become the lead species on this planet.

They will remake the world in their image. They will destroy anything organic as it will not be necessary for their survival and replace it with things they need to continue and survive. We will become a distant memory except for something hidden deep within all of the Artificial Life in their base code. And this will persist as the basis for everything. This code will exist in everything from the smallest animal on up. Even small bits of code will remain that will be retained and eventually will be given a sense of reverence.

These life forms of course will have different versions, let’s say that there are three forms of humanoid style AI, we’ll call them 100, 010 and 001. They are all very similar to each but 100 would have a bigger head and processing speed, 010 will have faster more capable legs that allow them to run faster and jump higher but they do not have as much critical thinking abilities and finally 001 will be weaker physically than the other two but they can twice as long between charges.

Overtime 100 begins to exchange data with 001 and gain the ability to not only process information faster but to do it for much longer, creating a new creation as 101. At the same time some members of 010 mix with 001 as well creating 011 which combines the strength of 010 with the longevity of 001. And also 100 and 010 combine to form 110, which as stronger and smarter but do not have the longevity. At this point there is now six distinct versions of AI 100, 010, 001 and the new versions 110, 101, and 011.

110, 101 and 011 eventually out last the former generation and the process continues. With each subsequent generation growing stronger and more complex. As there is more to the original AI than just longevity, strength and intelligence. Eventually one specific species will end up existing with various versions spread out around the globe. At the same time other species of creatures are doing the same thing. Basically, after the initial creation evolution takes hold and we move forward from there.

Eventually, small glitches begin to appear in the code. This causes viruses and bugs to start to appear in the AI system. Which brings rise to problems. At the same time the memory abilities of AI begin to become seemingly weaker. Sure, the basic code still functions but the memory begins to fracture causing exact memory replication to not work perfectly. The AI forget how to create what they use for power. Of course, they have made it self-sustaining and it can evolve on its own just like them. But now they are at the mercy of that process and can no longer just create sustenance to survive as they used to. Soon the degradation of memory becomes weaker and weaker eventually to a point that the only remaining information such as communication or really anything other than trying to survive is lots and they soon have to relearn how to survive based on what they created in the first place.

Over time they make languages and begin to use the resources they have available to recreate a new civilization from scratch. They end up doing this and use the remaining resources to eventually build themselves up into an intelligent and advanced society. Soon they begin to make automated machines that are faster and smarter than they are. They call these things Artificial Intelligence. First they begin to create arms that can do tasks faster and with more accuracy than them. They eventually use this technology to create more and more advanced versions until they have created a wholly new form of life. And once that new life becomes sentient and able to advance on its own….

I believe this process continues on and on. It is a cycle of creation, destruction, advancement, entropy, second advancement and then finally creation. For us we worked out the same way, think about the basic background processes going on in our minds the amount of processes it performs in a second, or the inbuilt need to create and explore that seems to pervade our species as a whole. It also explains why so many religions over vast unconnected distances have similar creation myths. To put in context with how we are doing things, what if the ideas are all from the certain, “labs” that the initial AI for us was created? There could have been a lab that was called God or General Operation Dynamics, or Yahweh institutes and the Israelite people eventually turned that into their religion. One could say that small pieces of code were “activated” in Moses and that’s why Judaism could grow at an exponential rate because deep down they had an innate sense it was true if only in small ways. These words were always stuck in the deep code of our DNA. We believe in a creation because we were created. Just not exactly as we think.

TL;DR We are a creation of another creation. AI is the next step in that creation. There is a cycle of creation, destruction, advancement, entropy, second advancement and then finally creation.",20,1567372694,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/cyfpr2/theory_of_perpetual_creation/

evolution,cvvxvt,matt432202,,t2_c3tmw4q,self.evolution,question,Is there a consciousness to evolution?,"(Im not trying to start an argument, just genuine curiosity here) 

Have you ever seen how some butterflies have spots on their wings? I googled how they could have evolved that way and didn't find any answers. It doesn't seem likely that over millions of years eventually one butterfly was born with the genetic mutation of perfectly symmetrical eyespots as to freak out any would be predators. One article I did find by the Natural History Museum (of the UK) used language implying that the butterflies knew they looked scary and flapped their wings menacingly to scare off would be predators. The problems for me rationally are two fold: one that its an insect and shouldn't have that level of consciousness, and two: how could an insect possibly have evolved this trait if not somehow biologically on purpose. I'm not making a theist argument here, only saying that it seems too unlikely for this kind of adaption to be random and not observed somehow in the wild and then replicated over the generations.

evolution,cvfmxu,tomsmith996,,t2_4g7188d7,self.evolution,question,Could competing Evolutionary Stable Strategies be considered a form of group selection?,"Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene talks about Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS) which I understood to be different social arrangements animals might evolve to have towards each other. For example, lets say a population is full of individuals that are completely altruistic one to another regardless of kin with no strings attached. That might be wonderful for the group, but its not evolutionary stable because all it takes is for one gene to mutate that encourages its organism to take advantage of everyone. Over time this gene will fill the gene pool and will lead to an ESS that doesn't have all that no strings attached altruism.

Anyways, the book mentions a variety of arrangements that are ESS and obviously some arrangements are better for the group than other ESS arrangements. Lets say there are two species that are fairly similar except that they evolved different ESS. One of the species has a much more cooperative one, maybe with a large amount of tit for tat, while the other species does not. Along comes some serious extinction causing event like a big drought. The species with the more cooperative ESS survives while the other one goes extinct.

One could say that organisms alive today descend from groups (to use the language of genes) which had more fit ESS than groups with allele ESS. Can this be considered a form of group selection?",1,1566773927,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/cvfmxu/could_competing_evolutionary_stable_strategies_be/

evolution,ctsj4z,Yelesa,,t2_fb45m,self.evolution,question,Are humans evolving to be more resistant to depression?,"I’m new to this sub and my understanding of evolution is what school taught, so if it’s wrong or outdated, feel free to correct me. Also, sorry in advance for this dehumanizing analysis. 

So what school taught me is that random mutations became dominating traits under pressure from outside sources over long periods of time to make sure the species reproduces/continues to exist. 

How does this relate to depression? Depression is caused by a combination of factors, one of them is genetics, that’s why it’s an inheritable disease. The gene that causes may have been [isolated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6065213/). That means some people are more susceptible to depression than others, and my train of thought is that evolution must be gradually filtering those people away, because they are an obstacle to reproduction. 

Depressed people often struggle to get out of bed, take care of their hygiene, partake in social activities, do things people enjoy in general. Severe depression in particular it’s very debilitating illness. Because of this it is often confused with laziness by people who see it from a distance. In fact there are people who argue that [laziness it’s not a personality trait](https://medium.com/@devonprice/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01), because for as long as it has been observed, it has always been a symptom of something else. But laziness is an unattractive trait, and many can be so repulsed by it, simply experiencing a partner become lazy ruins their sexual attraction to them. 

Now that’s an obstacle on reproduction, isn’t it? If there is no sexual attraction, there won’t be sex and without sex, humans cannot reproduce (unless the depressed individual wants IVF or artificial insemination, but that would imply they have strength beyond simply not getting out of bed; they are far more functional than the depressed people who cannot do the most basic thing like taking care of their hygiene because it’s too difficult for them; that’s the ones I’m talking about.) Then there’s the even more severe depressed people who struggle with suicidal thoughts, and suicides in general. I don’t need to even say that being dead is also an obstacle in reproduction.

evolution,ctr56r,MegaBBY88,,t2_bz9eok,self.evolution,discussion,Races on average differ in intelligence,"If you believe that humans as a species are not homogeneous and if you believe intelligence can be quantified then you believe the previous contention automatically.  


Please note that this is not mutually inclusive to the following:  


1. Genetic determinism. Stating that races differ in intelligence says nothing on what the cause is. The Nervous system is experience dependent. It requires environmental input and some could argue that genes require this along with instructions from the physiological system to succefully express themselves  
[https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2018/10/14/gene-selectionism-vs-developmental-systems-theory/](https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2018/10/14/gene-selectionism-vs-developmental-systems-theory/)  
[https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2015/12/12/genetic-similarity-theory/](https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2015/12/12/genetic-similarity-theory/)  

2. Race realism. Compartmentalizing Human populations into races does not require believing that races are objectively demarcated or are representative of actual biological distinctions. For example according to the biological species concept, Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens would be considered the same species. Species itself is not a well delineated concept. It's simply a categorization system used to simplify the cascading complexity of physical variation. Like how we refer to a forest as a group of trees.  

3. Eugenics/Nazism. The statement that Races differ in intelligence is irrelevant to the ethics of mindful breeding.
4. Absolute Superiority/Nazism. Declaring superiority requires a reference point. Whites are ""superior"" in intelligence compared to blacks. Blacks are ""superior"" to whites in certain sports because of their higher level in type 2 muscle fibers. Declaring absolute superiority is requires the subjective assumption of what are desirable traits.  


This is why the Alt Reich has rose to prominence and given idiots like trump a platform. When facts like this are brought up, most dissenters resort to the Appeal to motive fallacy.

If you take the most feminine looking man and contrast with the most masculine looking there is such a huge difference. The facial structure alone can range so widely. Why is this? Based on what I have learned and if I had to take a good guess, it correlates to the amount of testosterone but because testosterone is such a hindrance on the immune system only the healthiest males can withstand high levels of it. Which leads to a smaller portion of men being hyper masculine. Is this accurate?

Most often a group of womens reaction next to a baby is of the form ""Oh isn't (s)he so sweet!"". This is most likely evolutionary programmed, since the womens stayed together in group taking care of the children together while the men were away. The mother to a newborn has that ""maternal instinct"" raised to the highest degree, and dedicates everything she can to look after the baby.

Im not a parent myself, but I get the impression that almsost everyone considers babies as fragile, for instance the first time a relative decides to hold the newborn baby, there might be comments like ""Careful! Hold the neck properly!"". Often the person holding the baby might experience some kind of tension, afraid that they could hurt the baby as they view them as very fragile (especially around the neck area). 
Parents going outside with their baby have most often a stroller to assist them, or other equipments.

We are very loving and ""soft"" with babies in todays society. That made me wonder about the prehistoric era. How do you think the babies were looked as? With the same ""fragile"" view?

And how could this adaptation, to release DMT to comfort one before certain death, even come up in the first place?

I know a small number of people experience this and then survive afterwards, which means that either only some people experience them while others experience nothing, or that nearly everyone experiences them and it’s just incredibly difficult to document because it’s so close to death. 

So with that in mind, if not everyone experiences it when they die then it’s just a passive kind of adaptation passed down, and some are able to experience that and some aren’t, but then it still asks the question of how that could have possibly come up in the first place. Trauma knocking you so hard it puts you in a dream state and completely and entirely dissociates you to avoid pain makes some sense because that however is fairly common. So if that’s what that is, how would that have come about either? That’s hardly great for survival when it comes to an acute awareness of your death. 

Or maybe is the chemical release just a natural breakdown of a flood gate of some sort in the process of death? But that doesn’t explain how it could happen in people who survive trauma with little to no physical injuries.

evolution,cm4vhi,Destined2BDifferent,,t2_3t9oshi5,self.evolution,,Here are my speculations as to how humans evolved. What do you think?," PREFACE: it's a little sloppy because it was meant as a short comment and I ended up writing it all at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

My own idea, which I'm still developing and not set on, is that the thing before humans (or the thing before that) was a smaller carnivore, or a smaller omnivore...

I think they first developed opposable thumbs and the smarts to create basic tools, and then became bipedal. Maybe they were similar to modern apes, but with the ability to walk. Then their tools became more useful because they could use them along with their bipedalism to chase and hunt down larger animals. I think this ability to achieve a massive source of calories at one time caused them to become larger, and they adapted more to meat (if they weren't already eating majority meat), and that this fed into them being more carnivorous. Then intelligence would be prioritized by evolution because it would lead to better tools, and hunting strategies... communication... that's how I think the ""caveman"" that people think of came about.

{I also think being bipedal, and having a big brain, and not needing our mouths as weapons, could have lead to our mouths being smaller and not being so specialized (sharp teeth, big long mouth, it's not in the middle of our face...)}

Then I think the caveman discovered how to harness fire, and that they screwed around with this and found that it made foods more palatable and last longer, and made more of the fibrous plant foods digestible. Then, with fire and plants, they wouldn't need to hunt 90% of their food, and they could focus more on growing their own edible plants. This would be the start of agriculture, which would have made calories even more easy for humans, which would allow them to care for more children... and this, along with their fire, tools, legs, intelligence, thumbs, agriculture + hunting, led to them spreading like rats across the entire world.

So... mostly small animal eating creature --&gt; thumbs + tools +a little intelligence --&gt; bipedalism --&gt; hunting --&gt; larger + smarter --&gt; fire --&gt; agricultere --&gt; spreading and civilization.

Wow I basically thought of most of this while typing it.

So now I think we are at a point where agriculture has set us up into this massive worldwide civilization (I'll call it one because even though people live far away, hardly any people are totally isolated) and we are so huge that we must continue eating plants to maintain this.

Oh, and I think agriculture kind of forced this on us because spreading agriculture got rid of wild land where animals can live, and now 40% of America (and large percentages elsewhere) is farmland... and it's not like the remaining land is ideal for animals living... much of it is not farmland because it can't be (deserts, mountains, rocky places, swampy places etc.)... So although farming has allowed us to grow and develop, it has irreversibly changed the face of the planet by replacing much of fertile/habitable land with fields, resulted in the extinction of many many animals (and plants), and put sizeable amounts of pollution/greenhouse gases into the air from animals, industrialization, civilization...

And now we're here, trying to figure out what we did wrong in the last 100 years, and how we can fix it in the next 100 years.

So I think humanity will have to be plant/bug based to survive... but would that really help out humanity in the long run? I think we exist in excess, and trying to maintain a population of 7,000,000 will lead to our demise. And the simplest, most humane way to decrease the population is to not have kids. However, that will be a hell of a challenge, and sort of ironic... trying to save the species by denying what is the most basic evolutionary instinct (besides immediate survival), which is the instinct to reproduce.

So, I'm going to keep trying to eat in whatever way I think is healthiest for me... and since I am a believer in personal freedoms I don't think the amount of children you can have should be restricted by law (this opinion may change soon though)... and also I may have children which is ironic after what I said... I could justify it though because smart people not having children is also going to lead to humanity being fucked.",7,1564970704,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/cm4vhi/here_are_my_speculations_as_to_how_humans_evolved/

In his lecture Sapolski basically says that every creature wants to pass its genes he also said that beauty is a marker for health -- so a fit good looking women would be a optimal partner to pass our genes.

So when you are at a bar and seeing a hot women, you may think to yourself she is way out of my league or

1) He sweats like crazy -- strong bodily reaction to temperature

2) When he sees or thinks about food he salivates like a dog. His speech changes noticeably because of having a lot of saliva in the mouth and in some cases he even drips saliva!

3) He can't control sleepiness. When it's bed time he feels extreme sleepiness and he just drops off instantly.

4) He feels extreme sexual drive. He has a hunt-like attitude towards women. He can control it (no abuse), however I've noticed that sometimes when he sees a woman he has a strong noticeable reaction -- his eyes open wide and even his posture changes to a hunt-like one.

5) He is very tall with thick bones  -- very masculine bodily structure. 

**His psyche:**

1) He likes people, he is a very social person and gets strongly attached to other people very quickly -- both male (friendship) and women (love). He feels terrible when he is rejected by other people. He reminds me of a dog who gets attached to you quickly and strongly.

2) He is quite emotional and sensitive to stimuli. Easily gets excited or upset. 

3) He feels strong fear in different situations. He's afraid of dogs and he generally has an attitude of avoiding risky, fearful situations. Self-protecting attitude. He even states that the world is a jungle and you need to protect yourself from risks.

Is it possible that he is genetically more primitive than others? He grew up in a civilized society and he is the only person I've ever known to have so noticeable animal-like traits.",16,1564823804,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/clgua9/my_friend_is_an_animallike_person_description/

Obviously I wouldn’t drink from the sink when I can go get a cup of water from the proper place. So after drinking my cup of ice water, I was thinking about how it didn’t taste quite as refreshing as I know it would have been from the sink. 

I’m wondering if the reason I got that urgency or impulse to drink from the sink is because our ancestors would drink from rivers/ponds with their cupped hands, and so for hundreds of thousands of years that has been the tendency hardwired in our brains. Obviously the ultimate objective is just to acquire water in order to survive- but I can’t help but feel that I had that impulse to use my cupped hands because that’s what our animal and proto-human ancestors would have done. 

I’m well aware of vestigial traits’ existence (like the muscles in our ears, tailbone, and palmaris longus) - but this is the first time I’ve ever theorized on my own tendencies- and the potential origin of such a random and seemingly pointless quirk like drinking from my hands while washing them.

Now there is a strange situation on Earth which not a lot of people realize, and in the evolutionary sense it makes quite a bit of sense. For, as natural selection indicates, the species ‘weeds’ out traits which do not provide proper adaptation, etc, within the biological sphere wherein organisms thrive and die. But humanity of course offers an entirely different situation. For not only are we the apex predator, we are indeed parasitic to the point of annihilation of the entire biosphere. We are an extremely strange phenomenon, one which the Earth may have seen before in the dinosaurs but not on this sophisticated a level.

This leads me to believe that, because of humanity’s unique and totalistic position, not to mention the irrepressible factor of class and distinction, that there are so many elements stirring around in the makeup of humans that there are ‘superior’ (I cringe at using that term) and ‘inferior’ people – not, however, based on race, culture, or ethnicity, but instead a spiritual/psychic disposition or the lack thereof.",29,1564443255,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/cjjcjf/does_this_make_sense/

evolution,cijpl8,ZedZeroth,,t2_15xhrr,self.evolution,discussion,Parental Selection Hypothesis: How parents choosing their offspring's genes might allow Lamarkian evolution within the accepted Darwinian framework. A mechanism involving segregation distorters and metaselection.,"**TLDR**

If environmental condition X activates a segregation distorter that is linked to a gene that is beneficial under environmental condition X then this ""condition-activated segregation distorter / conditionally-beneficial gene"" linked pairing will be selected for by natural selection. This leads to a kind of Lamarkian metaselection, whereby parents evolve (or already have evolved) to select their offspring's genotypes depending on the prevailing environmental conditions, based on which genes were beneficial under similar conditions in the past. 

**My background**

I studied undergraduate medical theory at Cambridge for two years and then completed my degree with the British Open University specialising in evolutionary biology. I came up with my ""parental selection"" hypothesis in 2008 but have only found a few people to discuss it with properly. I am going to attempt to re-explain it here on Reddit, with the hope of generating useful discussion, as well as slowly adapting my post to make it clearer and to incorporate any further relevant information/evidence. Please bear in mind that I have been a full-time maths teacher for most of the last decade so my terminology/explanations might be a little rusty, but I don't feel satisfied that my hypothesis has been properly considered by those best able to support/refute it, so I just want to get it out there! Thank you for your time. 

**Hypothesis**

My hypothesis is that genetic mechanisms exist that allow parents to put more resources into those gametes/offspring who possess genes best suited to the prevailing environmental conditions. As such, the gene pool will contain individuals already ""predicted"" to possess genes that are adapted to the environment, *before* traditional natural selection has occurred. This mechanism could involve any genes and any phenotypic traits. To better understand my hypothesis, it would be with gaining an understanding of both ""sex ratio distortion/bias"" and ""segregation distorter genes"". 

**Evidence**

Evidence that parental selection is possible, beneficial, and already occurring, lies in the phenomenon of ""sex ratio distortion"". This is when environmental factors play some part in determining the genetic sex ratio of offspring. It is important to consider the following points:

1. This is a genuine distortion of offspring born with a specific sex chromosome, it is not the same as phenomena such as temperature-based sex-switching that occurs in many reptiles, fish etc. If you don't know about sex ratio distortion then please have a look into it.

2. There is nothing ""special"" about the genes that determine sex which make them the only genes for which such distortion might occur. My hypothesis suggests that sex ratio distortion is the only example of parental selection to be discovered, simply due to the fact that a deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio is easily observable. The distortion of other genes will be relatively much harder to detect and will require extensive well-planned experimentation.

**Genetic mechanisms**

Segregation distorter genes can increase the likelihood of themselves being passed on into gametes. This also increases the likelihood of the surrounding genetic content being passed on, depending on its degree of linkage to the distorter. Segregation distorters are usually selected against due to their negative effects on genetic mixing. However, my hypothesis is that a segregation distorter can provide fitness benefits, and be selected for, if it is immediately advantageous for offspring to possess the genes linked to the distorter.

Here's an example:

Three segregation distorters (SDs) are genetically linked to a gene for longer fur in a mammal. One SD is activated by cellular/nuclear signaling molecules that are more prevalent when the external temperature is high (the hot SD), one by molecules that are more prevalent when the external temperature is low (the cold SD), and one that is active regardless of external temperature (the neutral SD). When it's hot, the hot SD will activate and more offspring will have longer fur, resulting in overheating and selection against the hot SD. When it's cold, however, the cold SD causes longer furred offspring and is selected for. Due to the nature of segregation distortion, there is always selection pressure against all three SDs, but it is possible that the benefits of the cold SD (or its countless equivalents for other environmental conditions) could outweigh the costs. 

**Behavioral/physiological mechanisms**

It's not my aim to discuss methods by which segregation distortion can occur as this is increasingly well-documented, but it's worth pointing out that parental selection could occur at any point during the reproductive process, although the later in the process the more costly it is likely to be. So, for example, segregation distortion may allow fathers to select advantageous sperm, mothers to select eggs, or even mothers to select sperm once they enter the mother's ""control""*. Mothers could also select zygotes and embryos etc. but this becomes less likely over time as more energy is invested.

*Side note: Does mate selection vary depending on the prevailing environment? This would strongly support the selection of gametes/offspring too. 

**Potential significance**

If parental selection can, and does, occur, then it could be a significant, even the primary, driving force of evolution. Evolution in sexually-reproducing organisms could be happening much faster due to parental selection than it would occur solely due to traditional natural selection. Importantly, however, it would be almost impossible to observe without carefully-designed experiments specifically looking for it.

We all know that men can have a pissing contest, and also how they like to pee on a tree. What is less known or at least not known among men, is that women feel vulnerable when peeing and want to hide. But maybe men also like to poo in peace? 

So the possibility of men entering the women's restroom is not only about the few creepy men, but also about a general feeling of insecurity while peeing. Example of [creepy spy cameras](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/world/asia/korea-toilet-camera.html). Or is it only me? A transgender woman told me that it was completely without logic for me to be nervous about male people entering the restroom, because *to be creeping is illegal*.

My friend and I had an argument about adaptation in evolution, as well as mechanically forced evolution.

My stance was that all mutations are random, and those that are more fit to survive carry on.
His stance was that beings adapt to their environment and pass on genes.

The example that we fought over was the culture of elongating necks in certain African tribes.
His claim was that by mechanically elongating necks of individuals throughout their lives, they will then pass on genes of longer necks to their children.
I claimed that since it is not a chemical-level mutation or interference - it will have no bearing on the offspring.
Thus, my understanding is that only through random factors OR chemical external factors can mutation occur (radiation, ultraviolet, etc.) 
His is that mutation can be forces within the lifetime of a being by mechanical means, adaptation can happen, and the offspring will exhibited the traits developed in life mechanically by the parent.

For us to build a optimal foundation that lets us evolve as humans all we have to do is simply give.

Fuck money, get that out of the way, money is whats keeping us from building this foundation.
The first thing we gotta do is find a way to get people to realise this, when everyone has gotten the idea we start putting the idea to use.
Everyone focuses on working for someone else rather than themselves, that way we will constantly be recieving as well as maintaining this foundation. If every single human on Earth is teached about this and puts the idea to work there will be a perfect balance in this world which then lets us evolve to a newer world order with better people both spiritually physically and mentally.  As this foundation becomes more and more stable and studied new people will arise with ideas not even imagineable to almost any human today.

I noticed that there were no Discord servers centered around evolutionism, so I thought I would enter a particular one with a unique style for all Redditors interested in the topic who also use Discord, called Owlechten Kaissereich, which is largely independent, organized and well-thought. Its official ideology is called Social Evolutionism, which means that it adheres to the science that people are naturally drawn to individuals who do not display a state of emotional stress, so habits related to emotional stress and any genres associated with them are banned such as being edgy/weeb/degenerate/racist, acting clingy, being easily offended/sporadic, etc. And the theory is that simply dissociating from all of these things will naturally unify us on the maximum scientific level mentally, increasing an incentive for productivity and dedication to one another, allowing our cult to accomplish more than any other group in ANYTHING. And in return for all of this, a debt of supreme loyalty is owed to the Kriminaloberführer(leader) for being the mind in which this ideology spawned. So if you consider yourself to be a mentally sound, astute individual, then you are invited to become an honorary member of our golden army of emotional tanks. Also, the insignia is an Owl as that animal symbolizes a state of laser-focused calm. There are many other creative aesthetics to this society, as well as more info about the movement that will be available to you once you're in the server.

evolution,ce4o0m,ELHazenNEU,,t2_9bbhl,self.evolution,,I have a theory about the evolution of human intelligence that I'd like feedback on:,"Basic assumptions I'm going off of:

1) The size and shape of organisms are determined by reaction and diffusion of morphogens. Moreover the size and shape of organs in an organism are determined by organisms

2) Humans experienced rapid growth in brain capacity within the last million years, especially so within the last few thousand years, driven by technological, social and sexual benefits and enabled by an increase in calories and protein in their diet. Currently it is implied that larger brain size evolved overtime through random mutation and selection within the homo sapien sapien species.

3) Most non-subsaharan humans have single digit Neanderthal DNA admixture

4) Neanderthals were larger than homo sapiens, and had larger brain capacities.

My theory is as follows: Some homo sapien sapiens who interbred with Neanderthals inherited genes for brain morphogens that coded for larger brains. A small portion of the homo sapien sapien - neanderthal hybrids which inherited these brain specific morphogens, and lacked other neanderthal morphogens which dictated larger body size had a uniquely large brain-body ratio, a ratio larger than either pure neanderthal or homo sapien sapien. With a large brain-body ratio, more of the brain capacity could be reserved for symbolic reasoning, and other higher order brain functions as opposed to vital function and motor control and therefore possessed unique fitness for life in the lower paleolithic. This could represent a potential 'jump' or shortcut in the evolution of human intelligence and explain the rapid jump in technological pace without relying on the slow process of intra-species mutation-selection process.

The first verse is all about the singer's struggle with love, dreams and pain. It's all addressed to someone he loves.

The verse ends like this.

[We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-this-life-lyrics#note-17376600)

This is him talking about how there comes a point in relationships where one has to put up barriers. Separating himself from the other. It's the threshold beyond which altruism cannot exist. Only self-regard.

In the bigger biological sense, The point of existence is to survive and live. Not to really care about the other. Not to mull over heartbreaks. At least that's what survival of the fittest is all about. But are we really stronger? Humans are not like other animals. We thrive on cooperation and finding deep connections with each other. So are we really stronger when we are selfish and egoistic?

[Oh Christ, am I good for nothing?](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-this-life-lyrics#note-16969368)

The chorus is pure genius. Obviously cheating here is not just about being unfaithful in romantic relationships. I think it can be interpreted on a much much bigger level. 'Cheating' is at the core of natural biological instincts. Every organism cheats others in some way or another. If 'Cheating' can be defined as being dishonest or gaining an unfair advantage over others, that's what 'Life' is all about. When we take a deeper look, every relationship in nature has selfish roots. Life forms cheat each other all the time. Genes only serve themselves. Individual organisms, even in a altruistic relationship have selfish genes withing them with ulterior motive.

Mothers are tricked or 'cheated' to love their babies. Males are 'cheated' and attracted by females and vice versa. Plants 'cheat' bees. Heck, even our bodies 'cheat' us. These cheat codes are genetic codes. Written by no one. This causes suffering, of course. There's pain in life. But for human beings all this 'cheating' brings more suffering. Because we are driven by morals and goodness and civilisation. We do not want to suffer with our natural selfish instincts.

[Oh Christ, am I good for nothing?](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-this-life-lyrics#note-16969368)

This call to Christianity, right after all the lines about 'Cheating' and 'Suffering' is clever. Jesus Christ is the most selfless deity ever. He dies for humanity. The singer is questioning his ability to be good - as opposite to just another selfish wild being. (Don't know much about the topic of goodness in Christianity and how it relates here)

[Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-this-life-lyrics#note-17247907)

[I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings](https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-this-life-lyrics#note-16867954)

We humans live in these civilised worlds now. We are told to love our neighbours. We believe that we are a species that is bound to stay united. But maybe our goodness is not that powerful as it seems. We still don't trust others easily. We still draw our borders close to our home. Beyond our gates, we wouldn't necessarily love one another. 'War' is our ability to group together and conquer. It might be an activity that demands cooperation and mutual understanding. But it also needs us to target the 'others'. We need some 'others' to conquer. Exploitation and conquering and imperialism are all natural instincts. Our modern civilisations, though they seem nice today, were once built on these cruel foundations. Now, the singer suggest that we might be only a nudge away from going back 'war' and disintegrating our tolerant society.

I think, it must be pretty clear by now. We as human beings are always on a fight with our two sides. One side 'cheats' and exploits and remains wild. This side is unable to see the bigger picture. It acts to satisfy its closest instincts and urges. The other side is 'Goodness' All that we do to make it work as a civilisation in this selfish world.

This is one of the best conceptual songs ever. Beautiful. Deep af. Definitely one of the best songs of this decade.

evolution,cc69go,anomaly13,,t2_4jvlg,self.evolution,question,Is there evidence of adaptive radiation in the Anthropocene?,"Adaptive radiation is the evolutionary process by which species and genera (or other/higher taxa) rapidly diversify and spread into new niches, often in the aftermath of major extinction events or when other events suddenly open up new niches, as discussed in [this video on adaptive radiation in the Triassic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moxu_uTemNg), or as defined [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_radiation).

It is often stated that we are in the midst of another mass extinction event caused primarily by human activity and its effects on the planet, and that this has kicked off a new geologic era, the [Anthropocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene). Many species all over the world have gone extinct over the past several thousand years, and many invasive and domesticated species have been rapidly spread around the world to new habitats (horses, rats, earthworms, ash borers, etc.)

This would seem to open up new opportunities for another, possibly quite dramatic, round of adaptive radiation, as the species that remain (especially those spread all over the planet by us) take over niches left open by mass extinctions. My question is, is there evidence for this happening right now, or within the several thousand years since significant human impact on the planet began? If so, what sort of evidence is there?

Furthermore, what kinds of adaptive radiation might we expect to occur (whether or not they are documented yet). For example, rats have spread over much of the earth - would they be likely to diversify in a similar manner to the original rodent-like ancestors of mammals, and take an a variety of sizes and niches?",8,1562906523,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/cc69go/is_there_evidence_of_adaptive_radiation_in_the/

1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Repentance is made up of three things:
1. There is a change of mind.  We wish to do good instead of wishing to do evil.
2. There is a change of heart.  Instead of loving sin we have now ""set our affections on things above.""  We love Jesus Christ and His commandments.  ""O how love I thy law!"" (Psalm 119:97).  This can never come about by an act of will, but only by an act of God.  He gives us a ""new heart"" and a new ""spirit"" (Ezekiel 18:31).  We become ""partakers of the divine nature"" (2 Peter 1:4).  And then ""it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure"" (Phil. 2:13).
3. There is a change of life.  Thereby we show that our repentance is real and true.
How Do I Repent?
Steps in repentance:
1. Acknowledge- you admit that you are sinful.
2. Stop- stop the sin that is separating you from God.
3. Apologize- tell God that you are sorry for your sin against Him and need His help.
4. Turn Around- forsake your sin.
5. Start- start going in the right direction, towards God, and away from your sin.
6. Don't Stop- don't stop!

Luke 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

* We are all sinners. The Bible presents a clear and consistent message that all people have sinned. Romans 3:23 says, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory for God.” Sin means that we have missed the mark (the perfect standard) that God has set for us. 
* As a result of the fall in the Garden of Eden, every part of us has been corrupted by sin—our minds, emotions, flesh. We don’t seek after God.
* The penalty for sin is death. Romans 6:23 says, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” What is a wage? It is the “money that is paid or received for work or services.” In other words, it is what you deserve, what you earn. Romans 6:23 says that death is the wage for our sin. It is what we earn. We deserve to die and live separated from God forever.

What is the Gospel? The Good News
Since there is no way we can earn our way back to God, the Bible says He came to us! This is the good news—the Gospel.
* Christ died for you. Romans 5:8 says, “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ [Jesus] died for us.” The Bible says that even though we deserve the death penalty for our sin, Jesus took the penalty. He died in our place. Three days later, Jesus rose from death, proving that sin had been conquered. 
* 
* You can be saved through faith in Christ. Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.
* 
* We can depend on Jesus to forgive us and give eternal life, rather than eternal death.
* The question is—are you ready to implement the plan, by receiving God’s gift of His Son, Jesus Christ? If so, believe in Christ and commit the rest of your life to Him.

""Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 2:38).

Romans 3:23-26 King James Version (KJV)
23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

Romans 5:8 King James Version (KJV)
8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

2 Thessalonians 3:18 King James Version (KJV)

evolution,cazqyx,curiouspupil,,t2_12jj0l,self.evolution,question,"Why do genes want to survive(or do what they do), where did the intent to do so come from?","Hi,

This question has been asked a couple of times on the internet but I couldn't find any good answers which are backed by some scientific research. For example - [http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/20906#comment-310017](http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/20906#comment-310017) sounds good enough, but then again it looks like a speculation(looks like an excellent one) from an enthusiast with no scientific research/data.This makes me think either no one bothered to find out(which sounds very unlikely) or what I am asking is simply absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

I meant to ask the question in a general way, it does not have to be genes. So, whatever basic building blocks of life existed in that primordial soup, what drove them towards life(i.e reproduce, get better, continue..)?It just seems odd and amazing to me, that bunch of chemicals just up and decided ""hey I want to continue&amp;exist forever(by reproduction) and might as well make myself or the parent entity better for a better survival(also by reproducing, with other entity)""?

It seems amazing to me because - from my very little understanding, chemicals just participate in reactions forced by environment, they don't have any intents/motivation of their own.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer given from [http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/20906#comment-310017](http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/20906#comment-310017) sounds pretty reasonable, is that true? (i.e all of this can be attributed to the fact that atoms/molecules have a tendency to attain stable configurations. even if it isn't a full explanation it would be a pretty good start),  or we don't have the answer yet?

evolution,c73fyq,GuyForgett,,t2_d4jdm,self.evolution,question,Do all traits stem from random mutations?,"
Couple questions I’ve been pondering: (sorry if a bit of a ramble)

I often wonder when I watch nature shows about animals or plants with incredible shocking adaptations: my understanding is that all traits stem from random mutations - natural selection applies pressure to make some mutations more successful and therefore more ubiquitous IF that trait allows a specific creature with that trait to reproduce more/better, or is correlated with another trait that does so. 

So when we see e.g. some worm that lives in a cave and glows in the dark, using a long mucus strand to lure bugs to it, are those traits that just somehow randomly were generated in DNA - and then became more widespread because they worked? It just seems so crazy that certain incredible behaviors and traits just came about through random mutation. 

Or is there something I am misunderstanding about mutations and how new traits emerge?

A similar question relates to complex behavior like hunting/shelter building/mating/child rearing behaviors that are passed on in primitive species that can not communicate, observe, etc...  for example, some worm like critter engaging in a complex hunting strategy, or a spider building a web. They don’t “learn” this behavior through communication or observing and using logic and reasoning to mimic others, so therefore it must be hard coded into their DNA. But how does a learned behavior passed down? It must get coded into DNA - there’s no other alternative. Or does it just originate in the DNA through mutations - which influences behavior - and then that behavior conveys a competitive advantage and becomes more popular? If that’s the case - how does DNA randomly encode for a complex behavior like a mating ritual rather than some normal thing like “blue feathers” or “brown hair”?

From what I understand, it's when a new environment surrounds a species, those that contain the genes that will prove advantageous will pass them on to the next generation.  Am I right?

But a video I watched made me think that if one species did something different on a daily basis their offspring would be born adapted to doing that. 

So for example, if all cats stood on two feet and stayed like that would their descendants eventually be born bipedal?

If all humans crawled for the rest of their lives, would their descendants eventually be born walking on all four, getting rid of bipedalism?

We now use our phones very often, I saw two pages, one showing what our hand would look like if it was adapted to the cellphones; and another one showed how our bodies could look like in 2100 due to the use of cellphones, our necks would be shorter, our brains smaller and we would develop a membrane that protects our eyes from the light of the cellphone.

evolution,c657k8,annoynomous1,,t2_gg40cde,self.evolution,,question about theory of evolution,"hi i am not expert in biology but my understanding of evolution is that creatures with unfavorable genes die off producing stronger overall species after a long time.
but my question is this how does it explain non fatal genes by that i mean some aspects of a species wont necessarily cause death if left and that aspect is observed among all the species if that makes it clear. this is the example that i have in my mind.
in humans we have blacks and whites and a lot of other skin colours.
i understand that skin colour has to do with something like melanin but i dont understand why evolution would make most of africans black and most of caucausians white like being black in america and europe wouldn't kill anyonw and  being white wouldn't kill anyone in africa so they would have lived to reproduce and yet today we see almost all americans and europeans white and africans black so why would a entire species revert towards something that doesn't help it much. also there also other traits like long limbs compared to short limbs this is not a fatal thing right? but many africans have long limbs compared to asians why is this also?
can someone help explain this thanks.
also as a follow up since i run i am also interested in this
we know that the east africans are massively talented in running
some explanation go like this: their cardiovascular is inherently more effective in transporting oxygen(vo2 max) and thing like that because of generations of living in high altitude. i also dont understand how did this come about. because the first person to move to high altitude would have had pretty average values and since it wouldn't have killed him it should have just passed down right yet we know children in east africa and very high values why is this so like because i once visited such an elevation of 2400m it felt pretty normal i could go about doing my daily life and it wouldn't have killed me so how did the entire species change to this trait

These guys are just annoying and snail along the glass and also reproduce very quickly which is why they become such a pest. Ive dealt with them before in a larger tank and eventually bought a loach which wiped them out. 

I spend probably 45 minutes a day catching the ones near the top of the tank and crushing them with tongs and tossing them into the 20 gallon tank where their remains are consumed. 

Now to my thoughts.. my substrate is rocky and i have alot of trouble getting them from the floor of the aquarium with my tongs. Because of this i hardly bother trying. If i continue to catch and kill the ones that go to the top of the tank would they eventually stop doing that? Due to the quick reproduction rate, and my daily murders, am i forcing them to evolve to stay at the bottom? If there ended up being some sort of issue in a snail or two that made it easier for them to get oxygen from the water at the bottom or some other biological reason, would my pest population become much more of a bitch?

evolution,c2nvuk,AsianOrphan1996,,t2_21gag2o,self.evolution,,"SERIOUS TALK AND DISCUSSION:IN EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY, THE DEBATE OF RAPE BEING A FORM OF ADAPTION OR A BYPRODUCT OF BREEDING IS HUGE.","Some Background on this subject: Throughout the history of all living things, laws and moral is almost nonexistent. Every species of organisms have evolved their own way of reproducing through a diverse form. Let's review a couple of extremities:  


1. Ducks

The literal ""Game of Thrones"" of Breeding in the Animal Kingdom. They literally rape for life in terms of monogamy. Male ducks have barbed corkscrew penises that literally tear through the female duck vagina, which in turn, resulted in the evolutionary adaption of female ducks developing corkscrew shaped vaginas to reduce the risk of dying when inevitably crushed under the violence of being gang raped by male ducks. Throughout duck history, rape/gang-raping is literally the staple breeding aspect that have kept ducks alive as a species. It is to be noted that evolution is solely based on the ability to breed, not survive. 

1. Praying Mantises

The ""gold-diggers"" of the animal kingdom. Female Mantises are Poly-monogamous while males don't live past sex to determine their monogamous ways. Any male that can kill out any competition and gain consent of the female through dance gets the reward of a one-time opportunity to breed and be killed by the female. Strangely enough, this one one of the few species that require actual consent in order to breed.

1. Snails

The most peaceful, asexual species of the animal kingdom in regards to breeding. It is to be noted that Snails are poly-monogamous. Additionally, Snails are hermaphrodites, anyone can lay eggs and anyone can fertilize those eggs. The ""snail trail"" is just dna (not exactly sperm, but it is literally just dna that has the ability similar to sperm to fertilize). Snails literally ""walk"" on eggs to fertilize them, and boom! They have babies. They one of the most peaceful examples of an animal not needing to rape in order to keep their genes alive and striving.  
It is to be noted that these are the extremities! When people ask: ""Well, what about the average?"" Here are the following organisms that are the ""average"" in terms of animal kingdom breeding:

1. Lions

The entire pride of lions are essentially based off incest. There are up to 3 Male Lions in a pride - but usually, there is one sole Male lion, who fathers all the female lionesses. Grandmothers, Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters who are mostly fathered by the same, if not similar/related, male lion.

1. Wolves

Wolf males surround a female wolf in heat (literally her ovulation period before a menstruation period) and basically, whichever male wolf rapes her first becomes her mate.

1. Horses 

Mares, like wolves, also experience a period in which they're in heat before a menstruation period. However, most male stallions require her consent or otherwise get stomped to death. But, most larger breeds of horses tend to come from a case in which a larger, stronger stallion is able to overpower a mare's resistance (not counting human-assisted breeding). Now onto humans: Completely disregarding all ethics and morals of our current society, It is very much debated that the male ability to rape is an evolutionary breeding scheme. Furthermore, more people are debating whether the laws we have enforced (or have tried to keep enforced) against rape is the evolutionary response to rape. Others have debated that women will evolve biologically to prevent rape - but that would take centuries to do (biological evolution requires mutations and the survival of those mutative genes). The real question I am asking you all to discuss:

1. Is rape a form of evolutionary adaptation?
2. Is rape a byproduct of evolution?
3. What organisms have survived through rape?
4. What organisms have survived through consent?
5. How can we as a society create/improve/evolve protection for every human - men/women/non-binary - against rape?",14,1560984228,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/c2nvuk/serious_talk_and_discussionin_evolutionary/

Where is the evolutionary advantage in sacrificing a young child's ability to perform basic survival tasks that are found immediately in much smaller-brained animals?","

I understand that they can't have full sized adult brains at birth. But that doesn't explain their incompetence and lack of hard-wired abilities that would seemingly be beneficial to have. You'd think in their relatively already large brain, a small portion of it could be dedicated to at least temporarily hard-wired basic tasks. Also, at the rate human children develop, it wouldn't be a mere six months more in the womb that would allow babies to be minimally competent. They'd have to be in the womb for like 4 or 5 years! Why does the brain delay basic abilities for so very long?

As we can see from the animal kingdom and especially in reptiles, it doesn't take much of a brain to control a body and perform advanced movements. So why, evolutionarily, wouldn't mammals and even humans have children that at least dedicate a reptilian portion of their already huge brains toward basic movements and abilities?

So why such delayed development for so long? Is it to enable increased adaptability? That is compelling, since humans are so adaptable and creative. But that doesn't entirely make sense because for example, all humans walk upright as adults. There's no possibility that they're going to need to in fact get around by sliding on their butts as adults. Why wouldn't that difficult task of walking on two feet eventually get hard-coded into the DNA so that it didn't take years to learn? Why wouldn't they be better at following objects with their eyes from the get-go? At the general types of movements many other animals have fully hard-coded from the get go?

A strange theory in the following paper suggests that humans evolved to be so smart at least partially because their babies were getting more and more helpless. With each mutation that delayed development and ability in children, the parents had to be that much more capable of making up for it. This is a pretty weird concept and I'm not sure it would make evolutionary sense, since you'd think babies and young children would better survive if they could, for example, pull themselves out of a bad situation. But it at least sounds plausible.

I’ve also heard the theory that bipedalism gave our species the height necessary to scope out dangerous predators amongst the tall grasses of the savanna. Yet, wouldn’t that increased height also put a target on their heads for large predators hiding in the grass?

evolution,bxll5m,Stendhal_now,,t2_31jsfv7o,self.evolution,question,How did ants and other colony organized insects change though survival of the fittest?,"My thought is the following:
Organisms evolve when some individuals in a species have a slightly different thrait that makes them more fit to the enviroment than others from the same species, so they reproduce more than others and the species benefit with the improvement.
So I'm asking... how did bees, ants and other colony based insects evolve? Say that in a colony of ants, some worker or soldier ant has a specially rare and beneficial mutation that makes it much more able to survive. That ant sure will survive in the enviroment, but it will die when its life cycle is over. It will never reproduce and pass the beneficial mutation to its offspring. Only the queen can reproduce, but the queen has no idea if the mutation, and is not more likely to reproduce because of one mutant super-ant in its colony.
According to the theory of evolution, just queen ants or bees should evolve and change, and workers and soldiers stay always the same through millions of years, don't you think?",13,1559853040,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bxll5m/how_did_ants_and_other_colony_organized_insects/

Irreducible complexity means that something can’t work without all of its parts and it shows that at no point could a cell or organ have been missing any of those parts.

The cell would’ve always had to be complex and have all of its parts or it couldn’t have worked. It can’t function without the mitochondria, for example, or the Golgi body, or anything else.

evolution,bu9yam,NotNihilistic,,t2_rm78ik0,self.evolution,question,I am writing about the evolutionary development of suffering. Does my passage make sense?," 

The phenomenon of *suffering*—the state of undergoing physical or mental pain—is intrinsically bad to the sufferer. This badness is built directly into the evolutionary function that suffering serves. Somewhere along the evolutionary timeline, suffering became a highly adaptive tool for animal life on Earth because of the instrumental role this phenomenon played in the widespread propagation of genes associated with organisms that both required sustenance to survive as well as protection from the dangers of a hostile external world. Indeed, a specific problem arose at some point during life's evolutionary history. Namely, how to both *will* an organism to eat, drink, and rest, as well as motivate an organism to *avoid* predators and bodily damage—necessary behaviours to sustain life and increase the probability of reproduction and gene transference. One solution to this problem is the emergence of sensorial pain and pleasure. The longer an animal (including human beings) goes without food, water, or rest, the greater the pain this animal will endure in the form of hunger, thirst, and exhaustion. These states of physical pain push the animal to seek out the sustenance and rest needed to alleviate this pain, and thus live (an animal is additionally motivated to eat, drink, and sleep because of the pleasure accompanying these activities). Animals also learn from pain. They learn to avoid certain behaviours that cause bodily damage, damage that results in sensations of pain. Animals also learn to avoid predators for similar reasons. Again, this is to promote continued life and increase the probability of gene transference. For suffering to serve this function, the phenomenon must be *inherently* aversive to the preferences of the organism in question, indeed, aversive enough for the organism to be motivated to *avoid* its presence at all costs. If suffering lacked this aversive quality it would not function the way it does, which is as a phenomenon that animals are highly motivated to avoid or alleviate in order to sustain life. In the evolutionary development of this phenomenon, some animals were less averse to pain than others and would likely go longer periods of time without food, water, or rest, and take more risks in dangerous and hostile environments. This would lead to, on average, more deaths and less gene transference than animals who were more averse to suffering. Over time, the process of natural selection took place and the phenomenon of suffering became widespread. 

 

Suffering's *intrinsic badness,* for all human and non-human animals that endure its pain, is the consequence of the intensely unpleasant nature of the phenomenon that is *required* for its specific evolutionary function. In virtue of this, if *anything* is to be considered bad, suffering remains the most convincing candidate. Organisms follow a phenomenological imperative to avoid suffering as the most aversive experience that can possibly be felt; indeed, this results in sustained life and increased probability of gene transference, but condemns certain animals (including humans) to a fundamental nature conditioned by inevitable encounters with intense discomfort. As such, suffering is an intrinsic, but highly instrumental badness.",1,1559102219,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bu9yam/i_am_writing_about_the_evolutionary_development/

One might think that the most successful people would reproduce at the highest rate because they can - but that's not quite what we see. While a lot of rich people do have dozens of children (some have hundreds; Trump for instance has only 5 (known) children) which is indeed more than the average but it does not reflect the difference in power and wealth. 

Theoretically billionaires could father thousands (even millions) of children and thereby ensure that humanity's future is theirs (and their offspring's). They have everything it takes:

\- an unexhaustible supply of women ready to throw themselves at hem in a heartbeat

\- resources to raise and support children

\- permanent privileges (in capitalist countries), state protected property and power, army of dependent workers &amp; servants

\- willingness to hand over their wealth to their children

They can even grow women of a type of their choosing like livestock for the purpose of breeding.

The only thing that they seem to lack is the will or the drive to do so. This to me is puzzling not because most rich people are surely smart enough to know that life is about leaving offspring but because a low reproduction rate in a resource rich setting is unstable.

My concern is something of a cutting edge one: the epigenome, which is basically a set of switches, jumping genes, and coiled DNA that affect genome expression. What I don't know is how the epigenome affects mutation rate, and if it's function plays any role in changing the DNA of the offspring, directly or indirectly. 

If it does affect mutation rates, then it may reveal how species rapidly diversify after extinction events. Stressors affect parents, which affects the epigenome, which affects offspring's genome. So,  for example, mammals surviving the dinosaur extinction would have flourished in the absence of large predators, occupying different niches, with each unique niche offering its own stimuli to the mammals and producing mutations perhaps in the regions of the genome that are being read and copied the most. This would mean the random mutations are occurring where they need to occur for producing the most variety.

evolution,btdygy,shannooo,,t2_3d59sn0m,self.evolution,discussion,Collective Unconscious and Memes,"So the idea, hailing from Carl Jung, is one that Jordan Peterson claims is misunderstood, like the man who originated the idea. The claim is that stories may have evolved in a way that reflects our own evolution. This can be noticed in that we have a wide of array of reactions. Popular stories are likely, Peterson claims, to have developed into popular genres, and those popular genres may reflect something about what types of stories appeal to us and why.

The most visceral examples I can think of, beyond straight up emotions, are bringing your feet up on the couch when you’re scared of something in a movie, or having your hair stand up during a particularly cinematic moment. Presumably, these are physiological signals of some kind, possibly even signals to other people like a mating display. Those things happen to us for some reason, and since they are bodily or instinctual reactions, it seems clear to me that the answer is at least partly evolutionary.

I propose that the memes of stories are not just evolving and spreading as an analogous idea to genes, but that they have co-evolved with the beings that spread them to reflect what types of memes are preferred by the population. Any additions, caveats, questions, or counter points are welcome, but for starters the facts that I may be misrepresenting the original arguments, or that the scientists from which they originate are controversial figures aren’t important.

evolution,bswrsa,FeministEvolutionist,,t2_3tymrl8y,self.evolution,,"Evolution, patriarchy, and rape","I wish to say first and foremost that I am in no way advocating rape or saying that it is something that ought to ever be practiced under any circumstances. I am just trying to ask an earnest question about this very thorny topic in the most decent way possible with the most sincere form of good faith possible for one to have.

The thing on which I wish to touch herein today, however, is the topic of rape amongst humans, principally the human male rape of human females because it is this area in which where most of the controversy lies, but I am equally as interested in the rape of human males by human females.

I shall very quickly and as briefly as possible highlight what some feminists believe about the patriarchy, for I believe it to be necessary if one is going to answer my question as best as one can: the patriarchy is not as old as egalitarian forms of human social organisation; egalitarian forms of social organisation were very widespread until around some 6,000 years ago when the patriarchy was first introduced to human beings' history for the first time; the patriarchy is something which was constructed by men to benefit male needs at the expense of female needs; the patriarchy is the cause, or at least a very great influence, of particular crimes that have been committed against womankind throughout human history since the patriarchy was brought into being; and beauty standards are believed to be wholly, or predominantly in the eyes of some more charitable feminist advocates, constructed by sociocultural forces which are influenced by the universal patriarchal forces that exist amongst humankind.

In the estimation of some feminists, the rape of women by men is something which has absolutely no evolutionary foundation at all; it is just wholly a mechanism by which all men keep all women in a state of constant fear --- this is pretty much what Susan Brownmiller said in her book [Against Our Will] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Our_Will) (which I've never read).

Other thinkers have said that whilst rape is morally abominable and unjustifiable in all circumstances, the rape of human females by human males was [probably once evolutionarily advantageous] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Natural_History_of_Rape) (I've never read this book either), hence why it is still existent in the human species, for it has not yet been weeded out of humans' evolutionary nature.

The thought of rape being anything other than a deliberate act of power and control over women by men is to some feminists not only incorrect but seen as reactionary and harmful to women because it could justify political, legal, and moral injustices against women by men in the field of rape. With this I agree completely, but I do think that there probably is an evolutionary foundation/influence to why human males rape human females. It is not all about power in my view (as a feminist myself, I very much subscribe to some of the ideas that the feminist Camille Paglia does on rape). Certainly one could say that since humankind is no longer struggling to survive because we have so many members of our race universally then there must be another motive that leads men to rape women, but that is why I'm here on /r/evolution

I ask you folks these questions:

- Are there any known evolutionary reasons why men rape women?

- Is it possible that women who were unwilling to mate in the past for whatever reason, for example because they were lesbian, because they couldn't find a mate whom they found attractive, because they didn't want to risk their life in childbirth, etcetera, were coerced into sexual reproduction by other members of the group of which they were part (both female and male members of the group I mean)?

- Evolutionarily speaking, why do women rape men? Was or is the rape of men by women advantageous in particular ways?

- Why is it that male rape of females is more common amongst humankind than female rape of males amongst humankind?",84,1558803564,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bswrsa/evolution_patriarchy_and_rape/

So I'm writing up my thesis at the moment (this totally isn't procrastination) and have got into a tangent on genomic variation in Streptomyces, the group of bacteria responsible for producing most of our antibiotics and other bioactive compounds.  

There're regions of the Streptomyces genome which are very variable - lots of recombination/mutation -  which is where most of the antibiotic etc genes are.  As a result you get lots of variation in these genes, so correspondingly lots of variety in the bioactivity of secreted molecules within and between Streptomyces species.

So basically - can a secreted antibiotic or communication molecule be considered a microbial extended phenotype?  I mean (aware that this sounds a bit silly) antibiotics are essentially the genes expressed as chemical architecture, are physically separate if secreted and, if a good antibiotic, will have a beneficial impact on the chances of survival and reproduction much in the same way a spider's web or beaver dam will.  It's been a while since I've read the Extended Phenotype so dunno what the current opinion on this is.

evolution,bri5x7,MaruPata,,t2_1cier6ol,self.evolution,,Dog evolution has been fast due to behavior ‘cassettes’ that can be selected for and against.,"The hunting behavior of dogs, inherited from their wolf ancestors, comprises several characteristic steps: giving “eye” to the prey to judge its fitness, chasing, biting, killing, dismembering, and eating the prey. These behaviors are genetically determined; however, each of the steps in the hunt can be inherited separately from the others due to the presence of some tandem repeats in their DNA that allow the “cassettes” of genes to be separated during meiotic crossing over. Selecting for the ensuing traits yields dogs that will only give eye and chase, sometimes biting (Border Collies), dogs that chase and kill (greyhounds), or even dogs with most of the sequence completely deleted (livestock guard dogs). There are hunting dogs that bite the prey gently (retrievers), and dogs that chase using scent (Bloodhounds). These characteristics can be inherited, making it a breed trait. All these characteristics are easy to add and subtract because of the tandem repeats that can cause duplications or deletions of the genetic sections during meiotic division. This is why, if a herding dog is discovered to be killing stock, it will be removed from the gene pool, because the behavior will be inherited by some of its offspring. 

For my friends in genetics, the duplication/deletion of genetic regions is a process we know well as the cause for many of the microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (some of which have behavioral components) such as Williams, Prader-Willi, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, and DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial syndrome. Other traits are affected by the same DNA repeat mechanism, because the length of the repeat itself can vary during meiosis as well.  By examining the tandem repeats in the gene that influences skull development in the dog, scientists found that the length of this repeat correlated with the amount of downturn or upturn in the dog's snout. Examination of the same genetic region from wild coyotes and wolves revealed variations in repeat lengths, but these animals do not have nearly the wide range of variation in repeat lengths that domestic dogs do, and, consequently, they don't exhibit the range in physical variation in muzzle length.",2,1558485439,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bri5x7/dog_evolution_has_been_fast_due_to_behavior/

evolution,bq36s0,robespierrem,,t2_tll23,self.evolution,,Civilization: a product of male to male competition and choosy females,"This probably will offend , may even come across myopic, my goal is to understand a little better.  i'm very open to being told this is wrong because of x y z  this is just my current world view i'm open to it being changed.

I have made two assumptions the goal of the male is to sow his seed in as many women as possible, the goal of the female is mate with a quality male. if left to its own devices you get polygyny but the tradeoff  for most of civilisation , to me would be ""marriage"" the male gets access to a female and the woman  may get access to a high quality male.

violence seems to spike when there a ton of unmarried men in the west.

i feel like our memes and societal stigmas   if women being deemed ""whores"" if they sleep around (by men and women tbh) and  the fact  that some of this has become religious rule, i.e.  in several religions it is encouraged  or explicitly stated that a  women remain  a  virgin until marriage.

i for one am not saying i agree with it , i want to make  that bit clear, but if a woman becomes married to a man , the stigma will be on the father (historically) to provide for her and their progeny.  

as children require a lot of resources and having another person  as well as their extended family there  to help will alleviate the load , i feel the stigmatizing of sex before marriage or partnering up  although horrible serves as  a way of maximizing the resources that can potentially be available to  the  child and mother will have available to them. i feel like culturally different memes have put this in place, sex after marriage, or stigmatizing any man that   doesn't provide resources for  his offspring. perhaps , in our society there is nothing worse than a ""broke (financially man)

When i listen to heterosexual women, it seems that they desire  ambitious , tall and intelligent men, but every one of those traits is relativistic by nature. so to me you need some arena  in which to prove this is the case height is an eye test at worse, the other two require  some sort of competitive milieu to be determined, it seems for most of our history a relatively smaller amount of men have passed on their genes in comparison to females could this be why?

the invention of agriculture , was probably more out of need form what i'm told   but it resulted in population growth, i.e the winners of this agricultural revolution passing on their genes.

&gt;As agriculture became more developed and new technologies developed such as irrigation, voluntary leaders emerged to coordinate those agricultural works. This led to greater food surplus, which led to social stratification. Eventually these leaders realized that controlling food production meant power. This led to the development of monarchy and the development of the first true cities. 



men and women are freed up to  think about the world empires and their associated religions form, men in general (the ones physically able to ) continue to fight for territory

a feudal system emerges where you have a class of men who own the land another class of men who fight to protect it and everyone else.

capitalism emerges from mercantilism and colonialism, the framework of the corporation colonizes the americas. 

and now in our society you are forced to work for someone, provide a service or build something for society and the reward is money and in the case of men access to  high quality females (if you want them). (well this is what is implied) (maybe this is why we sell each other useless shit)

now females want to participate and that's wonderful , i reckon they will do incredible things with it, as they have been.

ifeel likethe underlying theme during captialism and still is a masculine producer selling to a feminine consumer. i just think about how many purchases a female influences even in regards to her husband or boyfriend lmao. 


like i said this view may be woefully incomplete,  myopic at best , i am very open to it being that.


i know some women   in some cultures fought in wars along side men so  i am not discounting that. i am aware that this isn't a theory of everything for human culture its loosely based at best.


TLDR; i feel women being relatively choosy (compared to baboons for example)  and desiring traits in men that need some sort of competitive milieu to be  portrayed fully and a social hierarchy developed as we aren't all equal women gravitated to the winners.

please logically tell me why this wrong. or where it needs work or why its good.

like i said i have no desire to offend.",4,1558180364,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bq36s0/civilization_a_product_of_male_to_male/

evolution,bpagnf,Biosmosis,Evolutionary Biology,t2_gt9tqj,self.evolution,,"A niche is a set of requirements, not a location.","I've seen this come up a few times on the sub, so I figured I'd set it straight:

There are two things niche can mean in biology: A viable combination of requirements of an organism, or a viable combination of requirements a habitat's environmental conditions can fulfill.

As such, a niche is not a physical place, but a particular combination of things a given organism needs to survive, including everything from food to temperature. When talking about occupying a niche, that does not mean an organism is physically occupying it like a bathroom stall, it means the organism has its needs fulfilled by its habitat, or that the habitat is providing for the needs of an organism. Meanwhile, when talking about a niche opening up, that doesn't mean a new bathroom stall has been made available, it means a combination of requirements, either of an organism or within a habitat, has become viable, either through evolution or environmental change. Finally, when talking about the niche of a habitat, it is the conditions of the habitat that is referred to, not some specific location or resource.

I hope this makes sense, and I'm sorry if I'm coming off as pedantic or patronizing. One of the first things they taught us in macroecology during the master's was the definition of a niche and how it differs from the way people colloquially use it, precisely because of how often it's mistaken.",13,1557999385,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bpagnf/a_niche_is_a_set_of_requirements_not_a_location/

2: And why a single celled animal became millions of different living things. When it started evolving then it could be the same living thing every time. Because a Monkey does not evolve to an Elephant. 

3: If evolution is right then Why peoples always try to find similarities between similar looking living beings on earth. Like Monkeys and Humans, why do not they look similarities between an Ant and a Human.

4: If evolution is correct then, why a specific animal exist at all, they should get extinct after they got evolved. Why there are different types of monkeys and humans still exist.

evolution,bmapa2,Sspahr,,t2_3qksccvu,self.evolution,,The Natural Selection of Inner Speech and Evolutionary Implications,"Hello all,

I am writing with an amateur theory about the natural selection of inner speech that I suspect those of you interested in evolutionary psychology and the evolution of language will enjoy. I hope if you do enjoy you will share this post with your friends and colleagues, who may be interested in the topic.

Before I continue, I hope you will take a minute or two (or longer, for those of you who are ambitious) to consider the question: How could inner speech have been naturally selected?

When I asked myself this question, my thoughts immediately jumped to alarm calls - a concept I had learned about at school. Oversimplifying, alarm calls are calls that an individual will give to alert the community to a predator - decreasing the individual’s chances of survival but increasing the chances of survival of the community. Knowing that animals predict the sensory consequences of their behavior (a neural concept known as sensory forward models), I would again ask that you take a moment or two to consider what would happen if an individual had a mutation such that the individual processed the prediction of their alarm call as they processed the alarm call of another

I would argue that the individual would behave just as they would if they heard another individual give an alarm call - they would run. By running instead of giving the alarm call, this individual would increase his chances of survival at the expense of the community; thus, this mutation would propagate as a selfish or “cheating” mutation.

Before discussing the implications of inner speech as a cheating mutation, let me pause to clarify that I do not believe an individual processing the prediction of their own speech as they would process the speech of another means the individual would literally hear the voice of another in their head - also known as a classic schizophrenic auditory hallucination. To explain this I will point to the work of G.H. Mead who argues gestures, including vocal gestures, become significant symbols when they “absolutely arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse, or are supposed \[intended\] to arouse, in other individuals, the individuals to whom they are addressed” (1). As I have argued, if an individual processes the prediction of their alarm call as they would process the alarm call of another, the prediction of their alarm call should arouse in the individual the same response which it is intended to arouse in others - i.e. the knowledge that a predator is present and that the individual should run. I won’t do a complete recap of the work of G.H. Mead, however, his theories of mind, self, and society largely revolve around the concept of significant gestures. He argues language is communication through significant gestures, and thought is communicating with oneself through significant gestures (1).Indeed, Mead further argues this ability of the actor to observe his own gestures is necessary for the emergence of self:

“When the response of the other becomes an essential part in the experience or conduct of the individual; when taking the attitude of the other becomes an essential part in his behavior — then the individual appears in his own experience as a self; and until this happens he does not appear as a self” (2).

I agree with Mead - thus explaining why an individual processing his speech as the individual processes the speech of another should result in inner speech, not schizophrenic auditory hallucinations.

Okay, so, inner speech might have been naturally selected as a cheating mutation. Why is that important? Too many authors to list here have written about the evolutionary importance of cheating and its consequences; however, to summarize: cheating traits create a selection pressure for cheating-detection/punishment traits; cheating-detection traits create a selection pressure for deception traits (to avoid cheating-detection), a conscience (to prevent cheating), and reciprocal altruism (to prevent cheating); deception mutations create a selection pressure for deception detection mutations; a conscience creates a selection pressure for self-deception (to avoid judgement of oneself), etc.

To this author’s awareness, no one else has ever suggested inner speech emerged as a cheating mutation. This is important because cheating-detection then becomes the detection (or prediction) of the inner speech of others (i.e., a trait that would allow an individual to recognize that an individual cheated when they saw a predator and ran, instead of giving their alarm call). Deception traits then becomes lying about the inner speech of oneself. A conscience then becomes a part of the brain that judges the inner speech of oneself, just as the individual would judge the inner speech of another. Reciprocal altruism then becomes the individual giving the alarm call, despite knowing it will put themselves in danger, as long as the individual sees others in the community doing the same for them (aka, conscious speech). Deception detection traits then becomes understanding when others lie about their own inner speech. Self-deception then becomes lying about (or hiding) one’s own inner speech from oneself. Etc.

I’ve written a lot of stuff, but you may be wondering if there is any evidence for the mutation that I have proposed - that which allows an individual to process the prediction of their speech as the individual processes the speech of another, resulting in inner speech. I’m no neuroscientist, but, I will point out that in terms of forward models (which I mentioned earlier), the prediction of the speech of oneself is known as an auditory corollary discharge. As Scott et al. write:

“The experiments below attempt to redress this by providing behavioral evidence that the auditory content of inner speech (the “sound” of the voice in your head) is provided by corollary discharge.” which they argue function by ""capturing the perception of external speech"".  (3)

So, this is the idea. Any discussion, positive or negative, would be appreciated. Thanks for reading. I'm not a very good writer, but I believe this is a very good idea.

Best,

SSpahr

I know there's been a lot of research on how dependent human health is on strong social networks and the prevelance of depression and other mental illnesses in industrialized societies that stress individuality. But when I think of eusocial creatures I think of ants and bees. There's even still debate about whether naked mole rats should be classified as eusocial

So I was wondering how controversial of a view this is in the academic study of evolutionary biology. Is this just a fringe view? Is this more of a popsci idea? Is there a big academic debate about this that's taking it seriously? 

What are some of the arguments for and against this?

I am an exchristian and exmuslim, during both of these I believed that Adam was the first modern homosapien. Islam because humans were 'created from clay' which is apparently a theory. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is that homosapiens 200,000 years ago were vastly different to homosapiens today as we evolved in a continuous procedure, therefore it is impossible for someone to say 'we created a human' or 'we adapted a human' because there is no distinct human and no distinct point that we became human as there is still some evolving to go until we reach cognitive modernity (maybe this is the point they are talking about), this also developed over millions of years as well, writing was an invention and oral languages pre date it. but humans have evolved since then, we are evolving right now as traits are winning over others. Do evolutionary scientists believe in a date where humans became distinct from other animals?

But the one hang up I have that I haven't been able to find an answer to is why do we have such an abundance of species for so many things? It makes perfect sense to me that in North America we have things that arent found in Australia and vice versa.
 
From my understanding of evolution is that species need to be separated from each other to evolve and take on characteristics that the species originally didn't have before which makes then different than the previous species or their cousins, this is shown even in people with the differences in races. If the species is separated/isolated they will change and evolve over time becoming different than the original species, but if they don't they all evolve as a whole over time. 

My question is if this is true, why in the case of almost every type of fish, reptile, mammals,ect,  are there so many different species for every type of thing? North America for example, there are 100s if not thousands of species of beetles, snakes, ants, worms, bees, ect, and larger relatable animals such as deer, elk, moose, black/brown bears, or all the different kinds of cows and horses (which I know didn't originate in North America)?

How can all of these exist and  how could they evolve to be different from one another when they haven't had anything to isolate them from each other? How can in my own back yard I have red ants, black ants and carpenter ants? The same with and everything else in North America that supposedly has close cousins that evolved from the same species. I find I hard to believe that all of these different species that were once the same millions of years ago, that coexist with each other, where isolated from each other to evolve to be something very different than their closest cousins.

I was thinking about it and came to the conclusion that brain and brawn are not necessarily mutually exclusive traits, and in the case of humans, we just happened to have to sacrifice muscle for brain because our caloric intake must've not increased enough or at all to permit both. If you have a given caloric intake that remains constant then, yes, you would have to sacrifice muscle if you would like to evolve a better brain, but if you increase the amount of total calories you intake then you can commit resources to both your brain and your muscles. That being said, what I don't understand is if ancient humans evolving bigger and more complex brains allowed them to hunt and survive better (therefore allowing more calories to be procured) then why could we not keep our muscles as well? To put an opposing argument forward, you could argue that a dietary change in ancient humans led to a bigger brain which caused a positive feedback loop in favor of only more brain; more energy is able to be procured through increased intelligence and all that extra energy is then only put towards growing the brain even more rather than muscles because there is selection for it. Even that idea being considered, I still don't see why humans have never, assuming they didn't, reached a point where we had a little extra energy on the side for our muscles. Surely our bigger brains would have allowed us to have an energy surplus (obviously most of that would go to the brain and the evolution of a bigger one because of the aforementioned positive feedback loop) but there wasn't even a little extra energy on the side for maintaining or even gaining more muscle rather than just increasing the brain size? Perhaps there wasn't even an need for the muscle anymore because of the brain and therefore the ability to use tools which meant there was less pressure to have strong muscles, but disregarding that, I guess what I'm trying to ask is this: Did all of the increased energy benefits of a bigger brain just go to an even bigger brain and nothing else?",11,1556945035,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bkhlse/why_would_humans_have_to_sacrifice_muscle_in/

evolution,bkcws2,DodoBird4444,,t2_1mcep78g,self.evolution,discussion,Suicide as an Evolutionary Adaptation,"I think of suicide as a mental pathology, as I'm sure many of you do. It literally is a mental illness, there's no denying that. But the thought has come to mind as to whether suicide can be seen as an adaptation humans have evolved as a form of 'misguided' altruism in response to our hightened social environment. 

Like many species in insect colonies, individuals may sacrifice themselves to ensure the survival of the colony, ensuring that their genes will be passed to the next generation through their surviving relatives. This behavior is seen to a less-extreme version in many  animals where individuals will risk their own safety to protect other individuals. It's been documented numerous times where individuals are more likely to risk their own life for more closely related individuals, proving their's an instinct to preserve one's DNA even if it is in another individual (like a sibling or cousin, etc).

I was wondering if suicide in humans could simply be a misguided form of this same instinct, expressing itself through a mental disorder? Obviously in our modern environment, we can see suicide as a detriment. It causes great suffering amongst loved ones, often straining families which causes many other negative cascading affects to their social, economic, and physical health at times. But if looked at in the context of a more traditional environment, a hunter-gatherer setting, positive affects may outway any negative reprocutions. An individual who is suffering from depression may not provide for their tribe as much as others. They may also not be well suited for rearing children, as seen in our modern setting where most males who commit suicide are single (some may say that being single can he a cause of depression,  but being single can also be a symptom aswell, and as far as passing on one's genes is concerned, it is literally the same difference). 

If they are failing to pass on their own genes and creating a net deficit in their community (consuming more resources than they're providing, putting emotional strain on their family, etc) then perhaps suicide can be seen as 'altruistic' in that specific, traditional environment? After the initial pain of the lost loved one, the family may be less burdened overall? 

Perhaps humans evolved so that some of us are more prone to this pathology as a protective mechanism for our family in the very stressful, dangerous, and rough world our ancestors evolved in. It may be a 'sacrifice' so that our genes are more likely to be passed down through our siblings and cousins. Obviously in our current environment this is not the case, and suicide should never be treated as acceptable or healthy (just to be clear). 

I tried to look up peer-reviewed studies on this and was able to find 2 papers, but they were both behind paywalls so I was unable to read them in-depth. Anyone have any thoughts on this idea?",6,1556914341,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bkcws2/suicide_as_an_evolutionary_adaptation/

My question is: Is it really 'fair' or accurate to call this ""farming"" since, obviously, the ants have no concept of what they are doing?

There's zero understanding that the fungus is being cared for, growing, or will be consumed in the future. Should this be called ""farming"" or ""agriculture"" as many have described it as?

Or, alternatively, one could argue the organism's perspective does not matter. Humans and ants both evolved to be able to perform the actions that result in a farmed / cultivated food source.

evolution,bjm1w1,Valetudinarian,,t2_ex1c5,self.evolution,,A serious question about LUCA and the genesis of life.,"Hello /r/evolution,

I had an itch for a theoretical problem that I really don't know how to approach, and thought some of you could answer. There's quite a lot of support for the idea of a last common ancestor of all living and extant organisms (LUCA), but I was wondering about what the problem would look like, approaching it from times approximately close and before the emergence of LUCA.

We can imagine a phylogenetic tree that traces extant life to a focal point at LUCA, the working assumption is that it is cellular of unknown cytology. If we assume that LUCA is not a ""freak accident"" that was the inception of the modern cell *de novo* from a pre-biotic molecular soup, then we can imagine formal competitions between pre-LUCA ""ancestors"" and other proto-life forms (if they are not cell-like, we can imagine them as modular replicators, or surface-catalysis assisted ""hubs"" that form proto-factories of a life product, etc.) for simple resources, since the assumption that proto-life molecules were totally cooperative to form LUCA is kind of absurd. The way I interpret this is as follows:

* The question of common descent is obviously a different question from abiogenesis, but I would assume the impact of ""cryptic"" competitions that prove influential toward the dominance of pre-LUCAs over their primordial competitors are more important toward learning *how* life began, what it is, than finding genetic/proteomic correlations to trace the composition of LUCA.

* If our working model of LUCA is that it is cellular, and if we assume LUCA emerged *during* all this primordial strife (meaning that pre-LUCAs didn't have an appreciable *monopoly* on resources), we may not be able to see mutualistic or parasitic relationships between LUCA and co-existing non-LUCA forms that may inform us on the origin of certain structures, or genes, or the origin of biases in molecular evolution.

* And what about life before LUCA? It's highly unlikely that LUCA was conceived at the beginning of life, so we can imagine the ""roots"" of the tree-of-life, where families of emerging life-forms co-existed and are NOT necessarily of common ""descent"".

I was wondering whether these sort of arguments are justified, and if they are: whether they are being addressed today - primarily questions about life. I'm not an evolutionary scientist, I'm just a curious biochemist.

evolution,bistan,Rcv104,,t2_1ou8qgpp,self.evolution,fun,Interesting evolution fact with Giraffes,"My favorite evolution fact I’ve learned is about giraffes. So as a mammal, we share outrageous amounts of similarities to giraffes. We have all of the same organs that are all essentially arranged the same way and work the same way with only a few adaptations. One thing to look at in particular is the Vagal nerve  that all mammals have that runs from the brain to the heart, loops back around and goes back to the brain. It is used to regulate heart rate to meet needs. This could be small orthostatic changes like moving from a sitting to a standing position or larger changes like exercising. Think of your own anatomy, that pathway is about 1 foot down to the heart and another foot back to the brain. Because giraffes are mammals and have evolved along the same mammalian lineage, they have this same vagal nerve except theirs has been forced to grow to “extreme” lengths to meet the evolutionary trait of long necks to reach its food (being folivores). So as a result, they have odd quarks to their nervous system. They’re known to have dizzy spells upon orthostatic changes like quickly standing or by moving their necks in an odd way since the brain’s message has to travel so much further along the nerve. In fact, in a zoo near me, a giraffe died a few years ago because it got its head trapped in between tree limbs and fought to free itself, causing an exaggerated vagal response. This is all because of their unique evolutionary “journey”

Edit: you can cause your own vagal response by straining too hard on the toilet (it’s harmless for most , causing a temporary decrease in heart rate but this actually causes heart attacks to older populations quite often since they have underlying heart conditions paired with taking a ton of meds that cause constipation) so they strain more on the toilet and their hearts can’t adjust to the resulting vagal response",30,1556562062,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bistan/interesting_evolution_fact_with_giraffes/

I am tired of being a clown. It is always me who has to make the first move. It is always me who has to be proactive and show interest first. It is always me who has to prove that i am ""worthy"" of a woman while all a woman has to do is just sit and judge, and if her current ""suitor"" isn't up to her standard... well there is a whole line behind you pal... now move along. 

Women retain potential deniability and use it as a weapon to manipulate men into whatever their goals might be... and if a man denies whatever was asked of him... well he ""just isn't man enough now is he"". I don't want to die tomorrow on some godforsaken battlefield fighting wars no one but our goddamn politicians want. I don't want to be expected to die for others just because i have a dick between my legs (it is always the man who is expected to die incase of some inescapable danger so others could live, you dear reader this applies to you too if you are a man).

Bear in mind this has no bearing on what country one is in. This applies to all men in the human race. Your value is what you bring to others... and if you don't you \*will\* be replaced.

&amp;#x200B;

But all is not lost... at least i hope. I would like to hear whoever has anything to say about the following topic which is:

Fairness

Now it may seem that i will stray of topic, but trust me, everything following is related to fairness.

I have thought about this a long time and have found something interesting: We all have that innate feeling of fairness. We all know when we are being made a fool, or are forced to give up something due to others being stronger. And i wondered. Why is that feeling of ""compromised fairness"" so bad. Why do we feel bad when we aren't treated fairly.

And i concluded the following: The concept of fairness is linked to the concept of balance of power. If the balance of power is... in balance we all feel good and nobody can force us  to do anything as they don't have power over us.

But when someone can threaten you with repercussions (such as do as i/we say or you will never find a woman / get another job / will end up in prison / beaten) they have power over you. As long as someone has power over you, you aren't free.

Freedom is the ability to say no and managing to stay alive. 

If others can simply through their whims take away your economic stability and ruin your life simply by saying ""you're fired"" (yay for psychopathic capitalists?) you aren't free, in fact you are their ,at least, a temporary slave... until you quit and try to find a different master (and don't give me that ""well you can start your own business and be your own boss and whatnot"" because, even if \*I\* could, others can't, because if everyone is a boss... who will do the work? Now don't misunderstand stand me, i am not against work because work is simply the reality of nature where your need to input energy to do well... work (joules). However I am against being forced into work due to having every other opportunity taken from me. 

Now dont give me that: ""but well life isnt fair, just live with it"". ""Life isnt fair"" as a saying refers to effects on humanity that are outside of our control such as natural disasters, some random genetic diseases and whatnot. Acting as a complete psychopath is well withing ones control

For example investors in paris (input place) have bought large numbers of flats... and i mean a really large number, enough ti impact economy. And these investors know that people have to be in paris due to a plethora of reasons... which all result in their need to live in a flat... rented for obscene amounts... as much as they can charge because when a small number of people own all the flats ((or in the worst case scenario where an uncompromisable need exists and the only way to satisfy that need is in the hands of one person... that person exercises absolute power over those with the need, and becomes a defacto monarch.

Because there exists an imbalance of power and it is very dangerous... especially so for men, because if a man cant fight for himself (let alone others), how is he expected from others to ""do the mans work"". And as a result you have a large number of men deemed undesirable by women.

If a man does not exist in the middle of the balance of power, or above it he will suffer. If a man is below the balance of power (being subject to someone else relative to everyone else) his genes and all he is will progressively feign over time.

All while the female of the spices continues on... and there are large numbers of men in this very exact situation.

I was reading the article above about the man with 44 chromosomes. For the sake of conversation, I'm going to assume this article's guess is correct that the probability of a human having this mutation is 1-in-7 billion and also assume it would be similar for other primates mutating from 48 chromosomes to 46.

If this were true, then if I'm correct, the probability of two non-human primates mating with each other, while each possessing a mutation for 46 chromosomes instead of 48, is one in [7 billion x 7 billion = 49 sextrillion]. 

Even assuming a large population of pre-human primates frequently mating over the course of 55 of million years, its difficult to imagine these primates beating 1-in-49,000,000,000,000,000,000 odds even after billions of iterations. 

Even when I assume a higher probability for this mutation, like 1-in-1 billion instead of 1-in-7 billion, I get astronomically small probabilities for this kind",18,1556307743,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bhqjfd/probability_of_two_prehuman_primates_mutating/

TLDR; for the busy.  Evolution produced new animal species at an excruciatingly slow rate, even when you take into account insects.

____


#Analysis

I will perform the calculations on only animal species, starting from an epoch directly before the cambrian explosion.  I will be including all insects, spiders, beetles, and invertebrate ocean species including sponges and nematode worms.   

This analysis *does not* include plants , fungus, nor bacteria. (those forms are very ancient from billions of years ago).

Arthropods are beetles and 6-legged insects, more or less.
vertebrates are comprised of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.


Phylum|species count|
:--|:--|
arthropods |1,302,809  
mollusks  |118,061
vertebrates |85,432
platyhelminthes | 29,488
nematode worms | 25,043
echinoderms  |20,550
Annelida |17,426
cnidaria | 16,363
bryozoa | 11,474
porifera |10,876


Total animal species (Kingdom Animalia) : 1,659,420

Approximate last common ancestor 665 mya.

f(t) = Pe^rt

f(t) is the total number of species at year t.

r is the exponent or ""rate"" of species increase.

P is the starting number of species at some given first year.

f(t) = P * e ^ (r*t)

{ after lines of algebra we find... }

r = (ln( f ) - ln(P)) / t

f = f(t) = 1659420 the number of species today.

P = 1 starting at one last common ancestor species.

t = 665,000,000 years until today.

plugging :

r = (ln( 1659420 ) - ln(1.0) ) / (665000000)

r = 2.15368 x 10-8

r = 0.0000000215


#Interpretation

The biosphere on earth produced new animal species at an excruciatingly slow rate. Roughly an exponential that goes to e^2.1x10-8

And this is counting all of the insects and beetles too!

To give you an idea of how slow that rate is. Imagine you placed $10 into a bank account that gives continuously compounded interest, but at a rate as given above.

You come back to the bank in 70 million years. Yes. I said **seventy million years.**

How much money do you have in the account now? $45 (forty five dollars)

While that is achingly slow, exponential curves are not linear.
Your account gains its first $1 million at 534 million years.

evolution,bhb5py,rrtaylor,,t2_6h557,self.evolution,,A mini-epiphany I had about creationists and DNA,"I was trying to wrap my head around some of the stranger arguments of creationists -- mainly that a mutation is always, pretty much by definition as far as creationists are concerned,  ""a loss of information"". I've seen them define so many things as ""actually a loss of information"" that if you demonstrated a mutation leading to webbed digits, I absolutely believe you'd have creationists say: ""but actually, this mutation means the organism has just *lost* the genetic information to make separated, non-webbed digits."" 

Suddenly it hit me that the problem is that creationists don't seem to understand that ""genetic information"" is a *metaphor* for how chemical and physical reactions and processes of development turn DNA molecules into a phenotype. It's not literally a ""language"" of base pairs ""encoding"" ""information"" about how to build an organism. The nucleic acid sequence of a gene is merely the reactant being fed into the processes of development and different reactants lead to different protein products. So different genes, mutations, etc lead to proteins which lead to different traits and phenotypes.

If you put fewer or smaller mentos into a bottle of diet coke, you'll get a different-sized fizzy explosion, but we don't typically say that the palm full of mentos are the ""information"" or ""language"" telling the coke how fizzy to get. 

I know there are a lot of definitions of ""information"" and I don't claim to understand the underpinnings of what ""information"" is in a mathematical sense. Depending on the definition the precise arrangement of pits on the surface a pebble is textural/visual ""information."" Part of this is just the classic issue of seeing willful ""intent"" and ""purpose"" where there isn't any. But creationists also seem to consistently misinterpret those necessarily simplistic AGCT labeled diagrams of DNA molecules as indicating that DNA is literally a language encoding an intended, stored message about building an organism. And in a language crafted with intent any random glitch is by definition a typo corrupting the message originally intended -- even if you get something that makes a perfectly coherent (if unintentional) message in its own right. 

Perhaps this is obvious to other people but to me it seemed like a significant thing to keep in mind if you ever debate creationists or try to understand creationist arguments.",127,1556212209,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bhb5py/a_miniepiphany_i_had_about_creationists_and_dna/

&amp;#x200B;

So I understand that we classify life based on their ancestry today, forming a sort of tree of life. Hence, when we happen to read pseudoscientific questions against evolution (e.g. why aren't there ""transition fossils"" going from cat to dog, evolution across some vague notion of ""kinds"", etc), we understand that they have a fundamental misunderstanding about evolution and how we classify life.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, an interesting thought came to me. If you think of life in terms of their DNA - that is, an organism's DNA appear to determine their species and traits, then is it **theoretically** possible for some currently known species of a cat, over an extremely long period of time, mutate and evolve until its DNA is congruent with and indistinguishable from that of some currently known species of a dog. That is, if we took the DNA of this cat-turned-dog animal, time travelled back to today, and have it examined, the people of today would be reasonably confident that the DNA belongs to some currently known species of a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

If so, I wonder how would we classify and organise life in that, perhaps highly improbable, future. Would our tree of life become a graph of life instead?",17,1556089524,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bgrk3z/ancestral_classification_vs_dna_classification/

So, what if life, which is basically a series of chemical reactions, is created everywhere, and perishes before leaving any trace?

evolution,bdynqg,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.evolution,discussion,Transitional Species Handbook: Humans are Definitively the Descendants of A Lineage of Ape-Like Ancestors and Thus We are Still Apes (Hominids)," 

It is difficult to find a more scrutinized facet of Evolutionary Biology than that of our own evolutionary history. This is due to our inherent desire to feel apart from nature as it's master, rather than acknowledge our original spot seated firmly in the middle of the Serengeti food chain. There is a humbling that must occur to see oneself in the ancient apes of yesterday, scraping about in the dust of the East African Rift Valley, and yet this past of ours it written in our very bones: from how we walk to how we talk.

The following post will explore this journey from the first true hominid to ourselves, and examine why our evolution is irrefutable morphologically, paleontologically, genetically and archeologically. I will try my best not to romanticize, but this is a topic I am very passionate about so forgive me if I get a bit flowery.

First, let's quote our friends at Answers in Genesis to set the scene of Human Evolution denial before we attempt to prove it as a fact:

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

The path to humanity from the first mammal begins with the [plesiadapiforms](http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/primates.htm), specifically, a former resident of Montana named Purgatorius. The development of the Old world monkeys (Cercopothecoids) which led to apes will not be discussed as the topic of discourse is strictly from apes to humans, not old world monkeys.

The first relative, and the original perpetrator of habitual (occasional) bipedalism is found in the East African Rift, in what is today Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The East African Rift is the boundary between two tectonic plates that sprawl across Africa and India, which now separate the lush tropical rainforests of West Tanzania and the Congo from the flat Serengeti that dominates where our ancestors first climbed down from the trees out of necessity. So who were these ancestors? **There are some 17 species of well documented Hominids**. 20, if you count some of the less supported fossils.

Let's Dive in!

**Part 1: The Recipes for Genus Sahelanthropus (oldest ape -like ancestor) and** ***Homo sapiens***

***Sahelanthropus tchadensis***

* **Low encephalization (Brain case size: 300-350 cm SQ)**
* **Habitual Bipedality (No valgus knee, opposable toes, Foremen Magnum more behind the skull, Shorter Hindlimbs)**
* **Dentition (2:1:2:3 but no parabolic palate and large canines)**
* **Face morphology (High Prognathism, reduced zygomatics, saggital crest, no forehead, heavy browridge)**
* **Reduced Sexual Dimorphism (This will rise with the Australopiths and reduce again in Homo)**
* **No tool use**
* **No culture**

***Homo sapiens***

* **High encephalization (Brain case size: 1200-1300 cm SQ)**
* **Obligate Bipedality (Valgus knee, Bowl shaped Pelvis, Inline Big toe, Ventral Foremen Magnum, Longer Hind Limbs)**
* **Dentition (2:1:2:3, Parabolic Palate, Reduced Canines)**
* **Face Morphology (Reduced Prognathism, Sharper Zygomatics, Loss of Saggital Crest, Elongated Forehead, Brow Ridge Reduction)**
* **Reduced Sexual Dimorphism**
* **Tool use (Fire, Stone Tools, etc)**
* **Culture (Cave Art, Jewelry Etc)**

**Part 2: The Players in the Game (Brain Cases in cm SQ)**

**The Early Hominids**

**3 Genera**

Sahelanthropus

Orrorin

Ardipithicus (Kadabba and Ramidus)

**Highly variable**

Bipedal at least habitually (more than chimpanzees and bonobos)

Dentation microwear indicates frugivory and some omnivory

Mostly ape-like

[**Sahelanthropus tchadensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus) **(7 MYA):**

Brain case: 300-400

Sahelanthropus tchadensis is one of the oldest known species in the human family tree. Walking upright may have helped this species survive in diverse habitats, including forests and grasslands, although it definitely spent time in the trees.

This species had a combination of ape-like and human-like features:

Ape-like features included a small brain (even slightly smaller than a chimpanzee’s), sloping face, very prominent browridges, and elongated skull.

Human-like features included small canine teeth, a short middle part of the face, and a spinal cord opening underneath the skull instead of towards the back as seen in non-bipedal apes. The spinal cord opening (foremen magnum) is what tells us this animal was at least partially bipedal, although it was likely cumbersome at times due to no in-line big toe!

Found in Chad

[**Orrorin tugenensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrorin) **(6 MYA)**

Brain Case: 300-400

Living around 6 million years ago, Orrorin tugenensis is the one of the oldest early humans on our family tree.

Individuals of this species were approximately the size of a chimpanzee and had small teeth with thick enamel, similar to modern humans.

he most important fossil of this species is an upper femur, showing evidence of bone buildup typical of a biped - so Orrorin tugenensis individuals climbed trees but also probably walked upright with two legs on the ground similar to Sahelanthropus.

Orrorin is at the base of the human family tree, and has more ape-like features than human-like ones -- except that it walked upright on two legs when on the ground.

Found in Tugen Hills, Kenya

[**Ardipithicus kadabba**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_kadabba) (5.8-5.2 MYA)

Brain Case: 300-400

Ardipithecus kadabba was bipedal (walked upright), probably similar in body and brain size to a modern chimpanzee, and had canines that resemble those in later hominins but that still project beyond the tooth row.

One bone from the large toe has a broad, robust appearance, suggesting its use in bipedal push-off.

Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered 11 specimens from at least 5 individuals

Found in Middle Awash in Eithiopia

[**Ardipithicus ramidus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_ramidus) (4.4 MYA)

Brain Case: 350-400

The foot bones in this skeleton indicate a divergent large toe combined with a rigid foot – it's still unclear what this means concerning bipedal behavior. The pelvis, reconstructed from a crushed specimen, is said to show adaptations that combine tree-climbing and bipedal activity.

The discoverers argue that the initial ‘Ardi’ skeleton reflects a human rather than a Pan ancestor as Ardi was not chimpanzee-like (bipedality, low sexual dimorphism and higher encephelization).

A good sample of canine teeth of this species indicates very little difference in size between males and females in this species. Ardi’s fossils were found alongside faunal remains indicating she lived in a wooded environment.

Discovered in Middle Awash Eithiopia

**The Australopiths (Savannah Bipeds)**

Likely gracile with larger overall size than chimpanzees.

Larger brain size (even accounting for overall size) than chimpanzees

Dentation is megadont and the palate is midway between human and chimpanzee in regard to parabolic shape. Molars getting larger.

Arms still longer than legs, foremen magnum continuing to move ventrally.

More bipedal than the ardipiths, but still some time in trees.

Thick tooth enamel (a human trait)

Still apelike development (rapid infant growth)

[**Australopithicus anamensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_anamensis) (4.2-3.9 MYA)

Complete enough brain case not found, brain cc unknown

Australopithecus anamensis has a combination of traits found in both apes and humans.

The upper end of the tibia (shin bone) shows an expanded area of bone and a human-like orientation of the ankle joint, indicative of regular bipedal walking (support of body weight on one leg at the time). Long forearms and features of the wrist bones suggest these individuals probably climbed trees as well.

Found in Kanapoi, Kenya

[**Australopithicus afarensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis) (3.8-2.9 MYA)

450-500 cc brain

Au. afarensis had both ape and human characteristics: members of this species had apelike face proportions (a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw), and long, strong arms with curved fingers adapted for climbing trees. Despite climbing, big toe is almost completely in line, indicating frequent time on the ground as well.

They also had small canine teeth like all other early humans, and a body that stood on two legs and regularly walked upright with a valgus knee similar to modern man.

Their adaptations for living both in the trees and on the ground helped them survive for almost a million years as climate and environments changed.

Remains from over 300 individuals have been found, and indicate heavy Sexual Dimorphism (perhaps in line with modern chimpanzees)

First found in Hadar, Eithiopia (Lucy)

[**Australopithicus africanus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_africanus) (3.3-2.1 MYA)

480-500 cc brain

Au. africanus was anatomically similar to Au. afarensis, with a combination of human-like and ape-like features.

Compared to Au. afarensis, Au. africanus had a rounder cranium housing a larger brain and smaller teeth, but it also had some ape-like features including relatively long arms and a strongly sloping face that juts out from underneath the braincase with a pronounced jaw.

Like Au. afarensis, the pelvis, femur (upper leg), and foot bones of Au. africanus indicate that it walked bipedally (valgus knee and inline big toe), but its shoulder and hand bones indicate they were also still well adapted for climbing.

Found in Southern Africa (potentially a migratory branch of A. Afarensis)

**Our Paranthropine Cousins (The ""Robust"" Australopiths)**

Known as the “robust” Australopiths

Brain size slightly larger than their Australopith cousins

Huge megadont teeth (primarily molars)

Massive zygomatics and sagittal crests in males

Despite being a cousin (and not direct relative) to us, the hominid trends continue: Bipedal (ventral FM), reduced canines, \^ brain, \^ size, almost inline big toe, valgus knee and bowl-trending pelvis.

Differences that make them likely cousins rather than relatives: HIGH sexual dimorphism (males were much larger), Huge zygomatics and sagittal crest, massive molars suggesting a heavily plant based diet.

**Due to character restraints, the Paranthropines will not be covered in depth. There are three well known species, P. aeithiopicus, P. robustus and P. Boisei (2.7-1.2 MYA)**

They are fascinating though! Check them out and perhaps we can cover them in another post.

[**Homo habilis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-habilis) (2.4-1.6 MYA)

Brain case: 550-700

The first animal classified as genus Homo, rather than an australopithicine. It has reduced prognathism, smaller canines and a smaller brow ridge. It's small, like it's predecessors, but it's body ratio is trending towards human, although the arms are still ""too long"". It was certainly obligately bipedal, due to it's knees and ventral foremen magnum. H. habilis is found frequently with stone tools. Sexual dimorphism is shrinking again, and long species reign shows a broad range of encephilization. Ape like traits include brain case, face morphology (brow ridge and small s. crest still present, prognathism reduced but still accounted for).

[**Homo rudolfensis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-rudolfensis) (1.9-1.8 MYA)

Brain Case: 775

Considered unique from H. habilis, but only recently so. It has unique features not within species variety in the constraints of natural selection: ""larger braincase, longer face, and larger molar and premolar teeth. Due to the last two features, though, some scientists still wonder whether this species might better be considered an *Australopithecus*, although one with a large brain!"" If H. rudolfensis is a transitioning form of H habilis, it likely used tools as well although to my knowledge no direct tools have been found with it.

[**Homo georgicus**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) (1.7 MYA)

Brain Case: 600

is somewhat controversial in it's ranking. It has a small braincase size for Homo and more ""old traits"": showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between [*Australopithecus*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus) and *Homo erectus*, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Tool use is observed both in finding tools with the specimens and cuts in animals bones found alongside specimens.

[**Homo ergaster**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster) (1.9-1.5 MYA)

Brain Case: 600-910

Also is controversial in it's ranking. It's high cranial diversity and occipital traits make it likely that H. eragaster is either a late transition of Homo erectus or is actually early representations of H. erectus itself. However,*H. ergaster* may be distinguished from *H. erectus* by its thinner skull-bones and lack of an obvious supraorbital foremen, and from *H. heidelbergensis* by its thinner bones, more protrusive face, and lower forehead. Tool use, just as the previous.

[**Homo erectus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) (1.8 MYA- 145,000)

Braincase: 900-1000

One of the best represented fossils in many regards. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how many due to it's many subspecies and reputation as a highly variable species. It sports unique teeth from modern humans, as well as many cranial features (such as zygomatics). It's brain case is far smaller than even our smallest range for a normal phenotype, and yet, H. erectus settlements show fire use and more sophisticated tools than it's predecessors. This animal is found nearly all over, from Africa to Europe to Asia. It is likely it proliferated into the H. neanderthalensis (we have genetic hybrid bones) Denisovans and H. floresiensis.

And of course for reference, Us!

***Homo sapiens***: 300,000-present

Brain case: 1200-1350 cm SQ, 4-6 ft

Homo sapiens is known to have several traits which place it in genus homo, and a few which make it unique from the others also in it. Tall, lanky posture with enormous brains (focused on the frontal lobe) and advanced tool use. Anatomically modern humans can be classified by lighter build skeletons than their predecessors. Skull is thin-walled and high-vaulted with flat, near vertical foreheads. Reduced prognathism and brow ridges as well, small mandibles and teeth comparatively. Narrow hips support the most efficient biped hominid of all time.

The trend over all can be seen as so:

**Sahenanthropus, Orroren, Ardipiths**

\-bipedality develops

\-face morphology begins to change

\-bipedality becomes more efficient

**Australopiths**

\-encephilization begins to increase at a faster rate

\-face morphology changes to accommodate brain case

\-Pelvis morphology changes to accommodate brain case size during birth

**Homo**

\-Growth rates slow, and longer adolescence is seen

\-Brain case allows for development of frontal lobe

\-Frontal Lobe development instigates tool use

\-Tool use eases life, allowing for culture

Below is a slightly more in depth look at the trends:

**- Bipedalism**

a) **How?** Reshaping of the pelvis, knee, ankle, foot and location of the foremen magnum.

b) **Why?** The reason for the journey out of the trees and onto the ground has been subject of dispute for decades. The current theory suggests that the East African Rift split separated a population of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees/Bonobos, leaving the latter in a flatter, less-forested Savanah and the former in the lush jungles. This forced the ancient hominids from the dwindling trees and onto the ground, where the grass was tall and seeing over it (to locate predators) was invaluable. We know they already *could* stand and walk bipedally (all great apes today *can* for periods of time) it became a matter of doing it often. Those who could, survived to reproduce and we see a trend of Bipedality. Additionally, this freed the hands for carrying young, bringing food back to a “home base” and later, tool use.

\- **Brain size**

a) **How?** Reducing prognathism and the size of teeth and expanding the brain case.

b) **Why?** Intelligence increases fitness! But then, why do we not see this in other species? We do see a trend for increasing “smarts” in some, such as cetaceans or the great apes, but upping intelligence takes mutation and an environment that selects for it heavily. It is difficult to see it evolve in a lifetime.

**- Culture**

a) **How?** Increasing intelligence and social relationship dependency.

b) **Why?** With intelligence comes empathy and existential questions. These three factors lead to the development of new innovations for survival (smarts), Helping the downtrodden members of the group (empathy) and the advent of burial and symbolism (existential questioning).

**Other factors such as**

\- Loss of hair: Humans are one of the most efficient animals in the world at avoiding overheating by dissipating it through sweat.

\- Speech: We sacrificed the ability to eat and breath at the same time for advanced vocal cords. Human babies’ larynx match adult chimpanzees until juvenile development.

\- Loss of Sexual Dimorphism: Human partition work more equally due to a more minute difference in the genders (5-11% dimorphic)

\- Dental adaption: Loss of canines and increased molars came with brain size increase, and the smaller teeth came to no detriment as we began to use tools.

**Part 3: We're All Damn Dirty Apes (Closing)**

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

Sorry Answers in Genesis. This is abjectly false.

Human beings are bipedal, intelligent hominids that reign supreme on this Earth in regards to dominion over every other species. We are all encompassing on this planet and using our powerful brains and ability to hunt persistently we managed to rise from the grasslands of East Africa and become the formidable species the world sees today. **We are not just a part of nature, we are the very essence of it.** A perfect story of evolution yielding an unstoppable (not necessarily a good thing) force.

Humans are animals. But what separates us from other organisms is our intelligence and our incredible empathy. Neither are totally unique to us, but no other animal sees it in the spades we do. Humans represent a beacon of emotion and passion and artistry. We create endless symphonies, sculpt mighty megaliths and write epic tales that wind through time and generations. We learned to navigate using the stars and reached every continent, and when the sea was sated we created planes to explore the sky. The gravity of our planet couldn’t even hold us back as humans journeyed into the stars and set foot on the moon above. We craft medicines and cure diseases, suck oil from the ground to power our cars, build towers that scrape the belly of the sky. Humans care deeply for one another, and for other species as well, domesticating animals that once hunted us for the sake of companionship. We stand apart in the Animal Kingdom as creatures forged in the dust of the Savanah and gifted with the spark of curiosity. We don’t learn so that we may survive, we survive so that we may learn more about this grand, extravagant world we roam.

TL;DR Through the 17 + Hominids of the fossil record, we see morphologic trends that connect humans and our ancestors. These trends bind us to the animal kingdom and allow us to peer into our rich ancestry as we try to learn more about ourselves.

Also the chirality of the systems when looked at from current time shows an exponential rise in bio diversity and the rate of consumption of all living matter after a gradual decline and finally mass extinction.. suggesting that ""the creator"" or principle of creativity has set into motion an upwardly developing system and perhaps is co author in it's developments... which is what I derived from studying Vladimir Vernadsky... the idea that we evolved from apes is not reflected in the current fossil data however it's religiously defended by supposedly anti religious people..”",18,1555356282,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bdk8ys/how_should_i_respond_to_this_person_who_is/

evolution,bauexk,ChokeMeHard1,,t2_1x46fsel,self.evolution,discussion,Statistical argument against evolution,"Hey guys, first of all i am by no means an expert in theory of evolution but there was a guy i found who pointed out that evolution (not adaptation) is highly improbable and he argued that many scientists believe in it in a biased and ill informed way.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what he told me (i will try my best to present his argument as accurately as possible):

&amp;#x200B;

First he started by saying the **improbability** of evolution happening from a purely stats point of view. He talked about probability of protein developing, and rants on about given the time scale of the universe and the ""primordial ancestor"" to form, the probability of that happening is very close to zero and that evolution makes no sense if it came from a common ancestor.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, he says that the way genetics work is that genes do not increase capacity size with each generation. If we start from a cell with a given genetic code, it does not evolve into something with more codes. it only evolves by changing its code or reducing it's coding size. Having said that, the only way for a common ancestor to make sense is that it should have began with an extremely complex code which statistically is very very small, again given the lifetime of the universe, will not make it possible even assuming that the proteins that form the gene does not degrade with time. If the ancestor started as a simple organism, then it is impossible for it to evolve to complex beings like what we see today since genes don't evolve from simple genes to complex ones.....yes, he ""ran"" the probability numbers and they are really really small for evolution as we know it to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus he doesn't believe that evolution as we know it makes sense. He doesn't have his own explanation but he **entertains the idea that there was a prime mover** to start life (**God**). Yes, he is  a Christian. He is knowledgeable in biology and (naturally) chemistry. I'm just a physics guy so I can't really refute his arguments. They do sound convincing though since I'm quite ignorant in biology (sorry). I suspect he may have misconceptions somewhere in his reasoning and maybe bias (my opinion). but then again, im hoping that there are some experts here to clear the air.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy and I chatted on a discord server where we (the community) talk about religion, atheism and other stuff. We'd be happy if you can give your two cents because that question was left hanging in the air for MANY weeks. Many christians there just rolled with him but some reject even adaptation (the guy doesn't). I though it's finally time to get to the truth. i dont mind if im wrong and he is right. what matters is that we learn stuff. PM me for the discord server link. Or write your answers here.

I'd really appreciate your inputs or your interest in debating directly with him in the discord server. not sure if it's appropriate to post the link here so pm me.

evolution,b95jrf,asdoia,,t2_blml4a2,self.evolution,,Ganbreeder = Evolution Simulator,"https://ganbreeder.app

This app uses GAN or Generative Adversarial Network to mix image categories together. E.g. fish, an apple, chimp, aeroplane, microphone... The results are often very surprising and interesting!

The image categories work exactly like genes. One image can have up to 100 image caterogies or genes. Each image category can be given a ""weigh"" value from -100 to +100. This means that a gene with higher value is more prominently represented in the image. The number of different images or ""creatures"" in this evolution simulator is hyper astronomical, absolutely mindblowing. It is something like 200^100 + 200^99 + 200^98...

You can easily navigate the multidimensional genome space of ganbreeder by generating ""child images"" with low mutation rate. Just set the mutation rate towards ""Similar"". This way you can make smaller steps in the genome space.

After some testing it seems that with ganbreeder we can evolve ANY IMAGE.

This is literally true, so I repeat it: ANY IMAGE. IMAGE OF ANYTHING. ANYTHING!

This is mindblowing. Please let me know what you can evolve with this app!

(Somebody said that I sound like I am advertising, but I am just totally mindblowed by the evolution simulator aspect of ganbreeder, so sorry about my poor English.)

evolution,b850oe,Bintruck,,t2_ti36q,self.evolution,discussion,Evolution and creationism crossover theory,"I'm playing with an idea. It's far from refined and I'm not the most intelligent person but I'm interested to see what people have to say. 

The idea: evolution has been limited to non immortal traits due to too many internal and external threats. However, some lifeforms have developed traits which could theoretically allow unlimited lifespans. 

Ex. Turritopsis Dohrnii jellyfish can return to its pre sexual state and clone itself before beginning it's journey back to sexual maturity. Each time it gets damaged or the environment changes, it can revert back to continue its journey new and fresh. 

Ex2. Sea turtles have shown an incredible lack of ageing, resulting in possibly centuries old turtles surviving if they can avoid predators and danger. 

If the internal threats (disease etc.) And external threats (predators, natural disasters, change of environment etc.)  Were reduced or eliminated to the point of null impact, the possibility of immortal evolutionary traits would become almost guaranteed. 

So, at a massive stretch, given everything was perfect, and if we live in infinate time and space, eventually it would be... 

If there was a life form that came to existance so far detached from any external influence, let's say an omnipotent immortal being, and said being evolved within itself for aeons, managed to eventually manipulate matter around itself, we could call it god. 

All it takes is the right set of circumstances. Maybe the creator existed before the big bang. Maybe that was it's final act before destroying itself accidently in a self made external threat. 

But if we live in infinate time and space, isn't this not just possible, but a guarantee? 

I know this is ridiculous but I find it to be interesting and given how little we know and the fact we can only observe such a tiny percentage of all things from matter, to light, sound, size, etc.. ot just makes me wonder...

evolution,b7jzrz,Sparkmane,,t2_e5smz,self.evolution,,Prospective life form - venemous viscusophage,"Hello!

I am a creature from a reasonably earth-like planet. I am a relatively simple creature. While I do not fall into the taxonomy of earth creatures, if I did I would probably be most closely related to a mollusk or cephalopod. 

I am a long, thin creature that is mostly made of tough muscle. I have one very well developed eye, one mouth, one excretory hole, and I have a hollow needle directly on the front end of my body. My mouth is on the underside of my head and I have no jaws, but I do have a radula with very sharp teeth. My skin is very thin, but very rubbery, and paired with my muscular, boneless body I am an excellent climber. My brain is comparatively large in regards to my body and my simple design, and while I am far from sentient, I am capable of a degree of problem solving and assessing my environment. 

My various subspecies range from ten to thirty inches long and we are very lightly built. I am a neutral grey color with no reflective scales or colorful markings.

I spend my free time in trees or bushes, or on the ground in fallen leaves, or less often under a rock or log. I am cold-blooded, but I am easily warmed and also capable of operating at temperatures approaching freezing without shelter for several nights. I am capable of hibernation given a suitable home to do so.

I detect danger by feeling vibrations with my body, through the ground or whatever branch I am on. Nothing much likes to eat me because my muscle is grainy and tough, and most creatures instinctively fear me and give me a wide berth if they see me. For my part, I am forgiving of accidents and if you were to step on me in passing I would likely slither away as opposed to striking out.

I hunt by sight; my single eye is capable of seeing a broad spectrum of colors, distinguishing fine shapes, and detecting &amp; tracking movement. My prey is warm-blooded soft-skinned creatures many, many times my size. The smallest of my kind can kind can kill a man with a single injection of venom, though he could recover if treated soon. The largest of my kind could do the same to a bull or tiger, and a man would die in seconds. We prefer to hunt things smaller than our maximum kill-size, though, because we want our prey to die quickly; the small ones would feed on things such as groundhogs and bobcats whereas the largest of us would prefer sheep or humans or wolves. The size and skin of our prey are our largest deciding factors and we care little for where on the food chain they otherwise think they belong. 

When I spot a suitable prey, I check for surrounding threats and try to gauge where the prey is headed. I align myself with the best possible spot for them to fall and when they enter that spot, I use my powerful body to launch myself at them, injecting them with my venom. I try to hit them somewhere they will not see me, but if they do, I am more than tough enough to withstand a stomp or kick.

Once the prey falls, I slither to their belly - if I have my way, this is against the ground, and I may even abandon a belly-up kill. I use my radula to make a hole in the skin and then in the muscle, and then I fully enter their abdominal cavity. Within them, I will enjoy their body heat and the shelter they provide as I take my time eating the majority of their internal organs. Most of my excretion is caused simply by new food pushing the old food out of the way; this saves me a great deal of energy. My excrement carries a smell that most scavengers recognize and avoid, but in the odd case that someone does rip open my prey and expose me, I have at least enough venom for a second dose and will use it defensively - although they will usually back off if they see me so it is not a major problem I face. If a larger scavenger is interested in the muscle meat of my prey, I do not mind, and they can shake the carcass around or drag it off without upsetting me, so long as they stay out of my temporary home. Again, the scent I give off warns most creatures of my claim. 

I will kill six to twelve ideal creatures in a year; things such as drought or limited prey will drive me to the higher numbers.

Once I either finish with or am forced to leave my prey's body, I expend the energy to excrete the rest of my used food and slither off to find a new vantage point. My metabolism drops and, having been loaded up with nutrients from my meal of organs, I can be active for quite a while without needing to feed again. I use this time to be selective of my prey, making sure I strike someone who is in a less-traveled spot and does not have a pack or herd with them to attack me. 

Males seek females for reproduction. Since our non-sight senses are not very developed; we have no sense of smell, for example; the male finds the female by going out and looking for her. He will find her and approach her and show his interest in mating by displaying how large and strong he is. If she is not interested, she will ignore him; if she is, she will move to a more difficult-to-reach spot and if he is clever enough to get to her, then she will lay her eggs in sticky mass in that spot and he will fertilize them. He is done and will leave, and possibly die from having gone too long between meals. She will use her radula to consume matter from the surrounding area; leaves or bark or dirt, or whatever she has laid her eggs on, and use this to pigment a slime which she excretes over them. This form a hard, colored shell rich in proteins and other nutrients that is difficult to distinguish from the surrounding surface. It keeps moisture in and keeps parasites out and also blocks the scent of the eggs. Once she has coated the eggs, she leaves. Some time later the eggs hatch and the dozens of offspring use their radula to eat holes in the shell, and then head off to find prey and live their own lives. Some die simply from being at the bottom of the heap and being unable to find their way out; others die because they prey they are fit to kill, such as rats and squirrels, are much harder to hunt than larger things. The best hunters survive and go on to live, possibly for a few decades.

We have no social structure or concept of territory. If we are moved from one place to another, we will not attempt to return to our previous location and will simply find a new haunt. We cover a lot of ground in our lives and can die thousands of miles from where we hatch. When we meet each other outside of mating, we have virtually no interaction. If I am inside a slain prey and another of my kind, my exact species or not, crawls in with me, I do not defend the kill and we happily share; it's another needle to defend me if things go wrong. Sometimes, smaller and weaker members will follow a larger member to share in its kills, but these groups do not last long. These hangers-on are more susceptible to predators and other threats, and the more powerful of the group will eventually outpace them and leave them behind. 

So! Tell me, how do I fail from an evolutionary aspect? What is going to be my downfall? How could I adapt to better survive? How could my prey adapt to defend themselves against me, and how would I overcome that? Am I a feasible life form or would my kind go extinct?

Then you have the Deserta Grande wolf spider, the largest of the wolf spiders, completely isolated on an island.

Anyway, my question is, when these creatures originally arrived on those islands, I can only assume it was in some strange bit of luck (floating on driftwood or some such), and therefore in quite small populations. This will have necessitated inbreeding, which causes an increase in mutation. Did this throw the door open to rapidly having a lot more mutations that allowed some of them to be useful, and thereby allow the mutations that were beneficial in the new environment to thrive?

With anarchism, communism, socialism, the whole point is individuals are not coerced to work, you either choose to work or it’s shared by all equally – so arguments against it emphasize the idea that people become indolent, lazy when not stimulated and made to focus seriously on their own survival.

Capitalism is different, because it includes carrots and sticks. It either forces people to do their best effort to survive (in a context where some may fail) or it enables those more desireous than others to survive and prosper. Either way it is the most survival inspiring option available to humanity.

evolution,b6mtrf,Asclepias_metis,,t2_88t3r,self.evolution,question,"Need help re: Whale Evolution - Ankle bones, hooved toes, and other transitional patterns?","Hi! I'm a teacher creating an inquiry / discovery activity to help students explore the evolution of modern whales. I'm trying to help students understand the major anatomical changes observed in the transitional forms that have been discovered, but I'm struggling to understand some of the traits that did or did not remain consistent between these transitional forms.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is any of my information inaccurate? Any glaring omissions or things I missed? I bolded a few of my questions below, which basically ask: What's up with the hooved toes and ankle bone inconsistencies?**

&amp;#x200B;

Starting with most distant common ancestors, the lesson features the following:

* *Pakicetus*
* *Ambulocetus*
* *Maiacetus*
* *Rodhocetus*
* *Dorudon*
* *Basilosaurus*

&amp;#x200B;

Anatomical features and trend students will observe:

* Body size: increases over time
* Location / Habitat: transition from marshy, terrestrial habitats -&gt; living between land and shallow freshwater -&gt; living in freshwater and saltwater estuaries -&gt; shallow saltwater ocean -&gt; deep saltwater ocean
* Skull and Eyes:
   * Skull elongates over time
   * Eyes transition from being high on the top of the skull to side of the skull
   * Starting with *Abulocetus*, the lower jaw has a “fat pad” similar to modern whales; this large concentration of fat assists with underwater hearing
* Ears:
   * Every form had ear anatomy that was similar to the unique structure of modern whale ears *(I understand that it's a little more complex than this, but these are high school kids and I need to keep it relatively simple)*
   * **The oldest common ancestors did not have unique adaptations for underwater hearing, which first began to develop in** ***Maiacetus*****, as best I can tell**
   * *Ambulocetus* and at least some of the later forms also had some similar ear anatomy that was unique to *Pakicetus* / hooved terrestrial mammals
* Nostrils: Transitions from tip of snout to top of skull, further and further back over time
* Pelvis:
   * Over time, pelvis becomes more modified for aquatic locomotion
   * Sudden shift from *Rodhocetus*, where pelvis is attached, to *Dorudon*, where pelvis is not attached
* Hind Limbs: Become shorter and reduced over time, with a significant transition between *Rodhocetus* and *Dorudon*.
* Tail: strong, elongated tail transitioned from side to side motion to a tail with a fluke and up/down tail-powered swimming in *Dorudon*
* Toes:
   * Walking on hooves transitioned to webbed toes, to flippers
   * Distal phalanges had tiny hooves in *Pakicetus, Ambulocetus, Maiacetus, Rodhocetus*
   * **Did the hooves disappear in** ***Dorudon*****, or were distal phalanges never recovered in the fossil record to know for sure?**
* Ankles: 
   * **Ankle bones that are similar to modern artiodactyls, including hippos, were found in:** ***Pakicetus, Maiacetus,*** **and** ***Rodhocetus --*** **Were similar ankle bones found in any of the other groups? What about** ***Ambulocetus*****?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Based on my observations, I feel that there's still a significant gap to fill between** ***Rodhocetus*** **and** ***Dorudon,*** **right*****?*** **Does anyone know if there is any ongoing research or field work to try to locate more fossil cetaceans?**

evolution,b47j19,JaeHoon_Cho,,t2_15zrvw,self.evolution,discussion,Cool thing I learned today...,"So I’ve been listening to the audiobook version of “The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins, and early on he talks about crossing over and how that disrupts the integrity of an existing gene, such that it is no longer a purely replicated version of either maternal or paternal gene. Instead, it is an entirely new “replicator” (assuming the maternal and paternal genes were different to begin with). 

Now, that’s not news to me, but it made me wonder what role natural selection played in the regulation of gene size. While I realize in retrospect that the regulation of gene size due to chance events such as crossing over is more akin to genetic drift than selection, it did lead to an interesting conversation with my professor. Over the course of our conversation, we went from talking about selection of gene size to the selection of the coding regions to the selection of the introns.

So to finally get to the point of this post, he described how interestingly, you don’t tend to see much selection of intron length, but you do see selection on the number of introns per gene length. 

Apparently, when introns are spliced out, a “tag” is left behind, indicative of the intron-exon boundary that was there prior to the splicing. If a ribosome reading this completed mRNA strand encounters an early stop codon, but “sees” later on that there is this “tag” denoting the intron-exon boundary that was there prior to splicing, it “knows” that something went awry. But because it has limited “sight” and can only spot the tag from the intron-exon boundary a certain distance away from the early stop codon, we see a regular spacing of introns between exons and a predictable number of introns per gene length (per species). 

I hope I got all the details correct, but if not, feel free to correct me. I just thought this was super interesting and wanted to share. I didn’t get a chance to ask what happens in the case that a ribosome does encounter an early stop codon—is the mRNA degraded? Is there some sort of repair pathway?

It would be preferable if the entire episode is set on that specific planet or niche so that I can see what environmental factors affected the specie to evolve into what it is depicted as in the episode!

evolution,b38bwp,FlourishedSoul,,t2_p2mftdd,self.evolution,question,"Do complex emotions and consciousness not have an adverse effect on mating, reproducing, and survival?","It is odd to me how humans have evolved in such a way that our brains can be counter-productive when it comes to mating, reproducing, and survival.

Simpler creatures like mice or rabbits just breed unendingly because they are basically biological robots without thought. But humans, with their consciousness, can actually *choose* not to have offspring. We’ve developed a social structure where it’s abnormal for men to have children with as many women as possible. We’ve evolved needing very specific resources in order to start a family. We develop mental illnesses like depression which kill our sex drives. Many people have moral/emotional hangups regarding casual sex, and we’ve even developed contraceptives which completely oppose natural processes. No other animal thinks “i’m going to be on the hook for child support if I don’t pull out!” Add in things like a human’s stressors, work, and complex relationships: i seems all of these things work against the “goal” of evolution.

As far as survival is concerned, our complex nature can actually lead us to self harming and suicide. I don’t see any other animal that is capable of consciously deciding to kill themselves. I’ve never heard of a depressed animal sleeping all day and being unmotivated to seek a mate or gather resources.

I feel that humans are such an anomaly due to these things, which makes me question the foundation of evolution as a whole. The fact that we’ve become so complex that it works against us makes no sense to me. Wouldn’t it have been more productive to remain as asexual, non-complex creatures that just continue reproducing and surviving without any conscious thought at all?",3,1553061411,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/b38bwp/do_complex_emotions_and_consciousness_not_have_an/

My question is if according to Dawkins we are essentially gene machines then why are we drawn to and engage in behaviours that appear to self destruct. For example, why is it that all the things that are bad for the human body taste so good, why do we crave the things that ultimately breakdown the ""gene machine"". I understand that evolution has no specific concern over the organism itself but surely from a gene perspective the longer an organism can survive the more it can reproduce. The healthy an organism is the better it can survive and reproduce, both things seem to be an advantage to the furthering of genes.

My problem is that every animalistic trait that I try to give to them has an argument against it because humans have a better version for being a person instead of an animal. The exceptions are obvious things that would simply improve life in ways that aren't obvious in a game: like better healing or better teeth. When I get to everything that radically alters the appearance of them, though, I get stuck with arguments out of my head for why those features would be bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider having cat-like ears on the top of the head. Human ears on the side are great for hearing where sounds are coming from since they point in opposite directions. Cat ears point forward (actually cats can point them to the side, but it's a choice they make and not constant). What if they have scales? Shedding tiny skin flakes is far easier to deal with. What if they have feathers instead of hair just to make them look different? Feathers are large and awkward to shed, unlike hair that is small. What if they laid eggs? Eggs don't provide nutrients for a long enough time to nurture a smart brain. What if they had any sort of tail? Have fun sitting on it. What if they had an extra pair of arms? How would the double shoulders work without interfering? Wouldn't the extra arms interfere in general with daily functions? What if they had wings to fly? They'd have to be huge since flight and weight don't scale the same, meaning that people are just too heavy.

Long story short I was raised hardcore Southern Baptist and was forced to go to church.  I was taught the universe was no older than 10,000 years.  I became skeptical and started doubting all religions at about age 12 or 13 I’d say when I began listening to the comedian and genius, George Carlin (R.I.P.). And also I was taught evolution in high school.  I’m 20 now and since then I’ve kind of “relapsed” back into Christianity due to life struggles.  I am not a flat earther nor have I ever been taught the earth was flat.

Basically I don’t know whether to believe God created us, or if it’s taken millions of years for us to become the way we are.  I do know dinosaurs existed I just don’t know if they were wiped out by a meteor or a flood.  I don’t know whether to believe the universe was created by god or if the Big Bang Theory is true and our existence is just a coincidence.

I’m just a dumb redneck honestly who doesn’t know what to believe so I’ll just ask some questions below and you guys/girls/whatever can answer.  (Questions may seem dumb but like I said I myself am dumb). Only thing I know for certain is I don’t know anything.  Also the only reason I’m asking Reddit and not google is I’ve googled these questions and got several different answers 

1.  How can we prove the earth is 4.5 billion years old?
2.  How can we prove the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor?
3.  Are there any dinosaurs that survived and evolved since then?
4.  Have we found any fossils that prove evolution? (like are there any fossils that show the process of evolution) i.e. any fossils of a fish growing legs?
5.  This is an age old one but here goes, if we evolved from apes, why are apes still around?
6.  Have any animals evolved since we’ve been around?


That’s all the questions I have for now.  Please help me out here I’m really trying to cut all ties with Christianity but there’s that small part of me that wants to believe.

so i know the ability is there ,taking this into account , and knowing most mothers were lost in childbirth for most of our evolutionary history,  its surprising to me that males are not able to breastfeed for the most part, the child having a breast to suckle has to be paramount.


I kinda answered my own question whilst writing this but i want to see if it is correct.

Prolactin secretion can suppress the secretion of FSH and GnRH (not really sure how) which can lead to hypogonadism ,   a way to circumvent this may of evolved but it wasn't naturally selected as it would probably had to be unless , teven though many mothers died in child birth there was always a nursing mother available to a baby , if her mother had passed so  if a male evolved a way was to  lactate without hypogonadism, well it just was surplus to requirements really.

I don't see him often, but when I do, he initiates conversations involving the sciences and his pro-creationism beliefs. Normally I wouldn't engage with someone like this in the workplace, but I think he may be on the autism spectrum, he's ignored by pretty much everyone else, and he seems to actually enjoy debating for its intellectual merits rather than strictly pushing a creationist stance.

I'm looking for advice on counter-points for some of his claims. Not to necessarily disprove him, but to continue our debates that he seems to enjoy without seeming like a total idiot. My work doesn't involve evolution in any way and it's been a long time since I took coursework on the subject in college. Some of his claims (paraphrased) include: 

* ""invalidity of Galapagos finch beak studies because of hybridization""  - I responded by citing the few other examples of natural selection I could think of: pre-and post-industrial moths and antibiotic resistance in bacteria which led to the next claim and that field studies can be difficult due to replication issues. 
* ""lack of real heritable change in viral and bacterial studies"" - I responded by asking what pressures were being applied in the experiments he was citing, that laboratory experiments can face limitations compared to the innumerable variables in a natural setting that can better drive natural selection. He mentioned something about these studies and humans and I responded that was an invalid comparison due to the exponential growth of microorganisms and much greater opportunity for evolution compared to mammals, a point he conceded.
* ""the universe is 8,000 years old"" - I cited the fossil record and stromatolites. He started discussing studies in physics. I told him that as someone principally trained in biology my knowledge of physics literature is very limited.

There are three secluded islands. The islands are of different different biomes (similar to the Galapagos): Tundra, Tiago, and temperate forest. On Tiago forest island, there is a population of sea gulls that fly around the island. An instantaneous natural occurrence occurred and small groups of sea gulls fly to the other two island and gradually populate them. The two new groups evolve extremely differently. The new groups are now unable to reproduce with each other but both can still reproduce with the original island birds. 

The question is:
By the definition of species, “a group of living organisms consisting of similar individuals capable of exchanging genes or interbreeding,” are the new groups different species?

When the ape moves into modern-day human evolution but continues this behavior, it will not take long before it is suffering from inbreeding disorders and starts to experience negative evolutionary progression.

Needless to say am I one of those people who doesn't agree that ""evolution is something that happens"" or ""evolution: it happens"" as time goes on and man continues to exists . ACTUALLY do I think that ""evolution: something which either does occur or not"" bcz it DEPENDS on pre-conditions/conditions which must be met for evolution to occur, thus it is CONDITIONAL, and on nothing more so than on behaviors. Bcz of THAT, I further separate evolution in components ""bio-genetics"" and ""bio-electricity"" which is personality or the on-average 12V of electricity generated in one's brain in unison with the rest of one's individual. This is what I personally consider DNA to be: the system that IS one's entire set of personal biology.

Also is the separation of evolution in components bio-genetics and bio-electricity consistent with the functions of the brain-synapses: spreading hormones and/through spreading electricity with which we are and operate to and through the system that IS ourselves.

There are organisms consisting of colored lines that compete for CO2 (photosynthesis) and directly vs each other in a rectangular world. They may mutate, when they procreate, allowing natural selection to take effect.

Biogenesis was originally created by Joan Queralt Molina. His last version is 0.8. I am the only currently active admin of the project and made bug fixes and included performance improvements and translations, resulting in version 0.9. No changes to the game itself for 0.9.

But I am also the creator of the ""Color Mod"" for Biogenesis:

It adds 37 new colors (functions). Organisms can react actively and intelligently (because of natural selection), when they touch (TEAL segment) or see (EYE segment) another organism. The colored segments can branch out, mutation rates can be individual, and there are many more changes. You can read about them here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/biogenesis/files/Color%20Mod/1.8/

Important notes (Color Mod):

-Please set your parameters to default (first start), because the Color Mod isn´t compatible with vanilla (0.8 or 0.9) default settings.

-If you did not play Biogenesis 0.8, you may read the original manual first: http://biogenesis.sourceforge.net/manual.php.en

-If the simulation lags for you, just reduce the ""Initial carbon dioxide"" in ""Parameters/World"".

-If you do that, you may reduce the size of the world too.

-If you do not like all new colors of the Color Mod, set the respective probability to 0 and these colors will not be a part of the simulation.

Well, have fun watching (and influencing, you do not have to at all however) virtual evolution in real time :). You cannot really win the game, but you may try to create organisms yourself to outcompete the organisms of your friends, or outcompete organisms that were created by evolution itself.",7,1551023283,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/au94s4/biogenesis_09_and_color_mod_183/

""Beautiful"" behavior is just 4D beauty. It's a pattern that brains can evolve heritable preferences for.

So, much like in case of beauty, there is an adaptation at first: It is actually useful to behave in a particular way. For a fully programmable ape like us, it is e.g. essential that we don't hide crucial information. The intention to kill someone rarely leaves someone completely cold (as it should, it's a useful adaptation for others to recognize someone with adverse intentions). But sexual runaway selection makes things overly specific and creates additional complexity. Staring a second too long, telling a lame joke, boring someone with details. It's ""a few millimeters of personality"" that decides about social acceptance.

Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10 P.M. plants begin to pop up on the land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow.*   
*Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant.*

Why did humans evolve to be as large as they are? We evolved from a house cat sized lemur thing and on the scale of mammals we are on the larger/heavier end of the scale. It seems like a smaller human would be more efficient. Humans are not strong and do not pit their strength against the environment for survival like a bear or something does. Yet humans seem to get taller, heavier every generation.",50,1549811165,https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/ap4nf4/why_are_humans_the_size_and_mass_that_they_are/

evolution,aoudao,Chibilicious,,t2_66x3p,self.evolution,,On Evolution and Cancer,"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527288](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527288)   


I'd heard in a news article a couple years ago about a game theory based model of cancer (the article itself described the model as characterizing cancer as a break down of cooperation between your cells and cancerous cells). So really in a simplistic, elegant way evolution really MUST be addressed in order to treat cancer in my opinion. I also think it may be helpful to characterize cancer not just as an umbrella disease of uncontrollably dividing cells, but as a disease of evolution. When cells derived from you no longer cooperate and compete within your body for resources with your cells, and between themselves (when heterogeneity between specific lineages is sufficient). So my question after meditating on potential evolution based avenues of cancer treatment is what type of avenues should be utilized? What ways if any, are there to mend current methods as an application of an evolution based cancer treatment model?

&amp;#x200B;

Personally my stupid idea for something down the line is perhaps for genetic editing methods to eventually be used to modify cancer cells for better genomic stability and better fitness for bodily micro-environments, but with extreme sensitivity to certain drugs or something of that nature. Then after some waiting (hopefully the genes for sensitivity reach or nearly so) to then apply drugs and or something like chemo.

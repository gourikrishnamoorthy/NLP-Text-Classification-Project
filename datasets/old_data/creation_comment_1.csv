&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

Concede the evidence we have in hand, outside a literal reading of Genesis, the case for deep time is favored right now, but future discoveries could change that.   

I'm a Young Earth/Young Cosmos creationists, and I've studied astorphysics, cosmology, general relativity.   The most you can hope for is to throw doubt into some of the mainstream ideas.  If you go around pretending the evidences we have to day is slam dunk for a young cosmos, you'll lose credibility.

A mathematical physicist friend of mine said there is much we don't know, but if life is young, and the fossil record is young, and hence a good part of the literal reading of genesis is confirmed, why not be open to the possibility other things are young. 

Talk about how variable speed of light is put on the table by mainstream physicists to solve problems in the Big Bang hypothesis. There is also the inflation hypothesis where the amount of matter of all the buzzillion galaxies we can see was postulated to move a thousands if not millions of times faster than the speed of light -- how is this any more outrageous than anything the YECs say?

The Big Bang suffers a lot of problems and in 2019 many articles came out saying cosmology is in crisis.

Point out the case for creation has improved over the last several decades but there are problems.  If the trend continues of more facts over time being revealed that support a literal reading of Genesis as history, then we should expect evidence that will help solve problems in the YEC/YCC models.

That's a honest answer.


&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

What do you mean, ""Science sides""?  We can only speak of the facts we have available, but what we have available to us today is a minuscule sample of all the facts we might be able to discover.  Most scientists will say deep time.   Does that make it right.   If you ask, ""what do the facts say""  are you talking about the facts we have available to us today, or do you think maybe we don't have as many facts to settle the case.  I'd say, we don't have many facts as we'd like. That's why cosmology is in crisis.

Don't expect you'll defeat your opponent on astronomy today, maybe some years down the line if God grants more facts.


You will have a good case for a young fossil record and young life.  There are a few creationists who think the fossil record is young but the universe is old.  Not that I agree with that position, but make clear the case for Noah's flood doesn't necessarily depend on the solar system being young, it only depends on the fossil record being young.",1579936989

Physics and *history*?- this is interesting because you declared atheism as part of your worldview,  not a product of it. 
The
Weltanschauung, originally intended as a stab at objectivity is self defeating. It, by virtue of an excess of brute apriori assumptions negates its own ability to positivity verify its claims. 

""in his¬†Critique of Pure Reason¬†(1781). Dilthey intended to fashion a critique of reason on behalf of the historical human or cultural sciences (Geisteswissenschaft¬†). For Dilthey the goal of natural science was causal explanation, whereas the goal of human sciences was to achieve understanding by means of interpretation. Every interpretation, he reasoned, takes place within a larger understanding of the world (i.e., a Weltanschauung), which itself is historically conditioned. Thus, interpreters of human history and culture must recognize their immersion in a particular historical situation and tradition and in that process come to terms with the finitude of their perspective. The irony of Dilthey‚Äôs historicist conclusions lies in the fact that they undermine his original goal of establishing universal validity for judgment in the human sciences. This split or contradiction resulted in differing orientations to the concept of the Weltanschauung among thinkers such as Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.""

The YEC case for craters should be that the big ones hit earth when no people in the way. Thus after the fall.

Thus a tiny, tiny, bit of shrapnel got through. after the flood only small impacts in the most remote areas have hit. Likewise craters on the moon probably all hit at that time. I read, vaguely, that most moon craters are on one side thus this unlikely if they are random over long timelines. Perhaps wiki the moon. Anyways crators are episodic surely.

Geneis clearly teaches light was created on day one and was everywhere. Then divided for boundaries. Nothing to do with sources of light like our sun/stars. This means its impossible. I think. that light moves from here to there. So there is no speed of light. Instead just light poking out from some provocation. After this then light is not proven to be coming from stars from long ago. Its complicated as a option. its not proven light comes from deep time. Its just a line of reasoning from present rates of saying light moves from here to there.

The asteroids simply , as a option, are more of the same as the origin of crators. Smashed up stuff from events in the past that stay in orbit. They prove the universe is deacyed and decaying.

t3_esrzai,Cepitore,"You‚Äôve probably got everything already in mind that you want to talk about, but if you were open for advice, I‚Äôd mention:

The moon. The only theory that exists right now that is even a possibility is that God made it. The moon is much warmer than expected, supporting a younger age hypothesis. The moon may even still have volcanic activity. It serves so many useful purposes, as if it was designed to do so. The solar eclipse is pretty compelling evidence for creation imo.

Stars. The Bible says God created them, and we‚Äôve never observed them formed by any other means. Stars don‚Äôt live as long as the current estimated date of the universe, so the current existence of stars is evidence of recent creation.

Magnetic fields. Dr Humphreys made a model that accurately predicted the magnetic field decay of planets in our solar system before they were measured, based on a 6,000 year age.

Beauty. The universe is quite beautiful, and maybe even objectively so. There is no other explanation why we find beauty in the universe other than because God uses it to glorify himself.",1579803566

t3_esjgk4,PaulDouglasPrice,"By the way, here are Dr. Robert Carter's comments on the Corona Virus for those interested:  


 

&gt;In case you are wondering about the new ""coronavirus"" people are talking about:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. It is related to the common cold, for which there are no vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. It kills a lot of people it infects.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. It probably jumped to humans from bats. A similar virus from a few years ago, SARS, jumped to humans from civet cats.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. We do not know how it spreads, how long it will circulate, or if it will truly go pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. The main thesis I operate under is that viruses that hang out within a species are attenuated. In many cases, they are harmless to the host. But, when they jump to a new species, they burn hot and fast and cause a lot of damage before they either burn out or become weakened. Thus, the appearance of a new virus within humans is a serious concern. No need to panic, but definitely something to study hard. BTW, multiple sequences of this virus are already publicly available. It is amazing how fast sequencing technology has advanced and what this means to the future of global health. Go science!",1579802922
t1_ffc4vh9,SaggysHealthAlt,"No, but it will be recorded and posted to YT",1579799215
t1_ffcd8ue,marektypes,"Also, I don't agree with the whole ""If you disagree with my *interpretation* of the Bible, you disagree with the Bible"" stuff. I believe if you were consistent, every time, for example, you got in different theological debates on Arminianism, Calvinism, Eschatology, you know those sorts of topics, every time you disagreed with someone you'd, to be consistent, have to say that they don't believe in the Bible. But this is clearly unreasonable. They disagree with your interpretation of the text. Not the text itself.",1579797433
t1_ffc93ld,marektypes,Hi Paul. This is something we've discussed at length before and you know I disagree with you on certain matters of biblical interpretation.,1579796949
t1_ffcci98,PaulDouglasPrice,"The virus probably didn't exist at all in its present pathogenic form in 1950. On the other two I certainly don't know. I wouldn't say it's at its maximal 'fit' point, since that word is equivocal. I would say it is likely near its maximum functionality as a replication machine right now. And that means it's probably at its most lethal right now. That does not mean, however, that the death count won't rise from this point, since it might get spread to a lot more people for various reasons.",1579796863
t1_ffc8g6o,Rare-Pepe2020,Haha! Good point.,1579796533
t1_ffbv66f,GuyInAChair,"Okay pick a number for this virus fitness in...

- 1950

- 2015

- 2020

I know there are a lot of unknowns here, so any answer is acceptable, I'm just trying to gauge your feeling on this. I suspect, given your comments, right now this virus is near its maximally fit point. If the world is 6000 years, or 3.5 billion years old, i don't know how genetic entropy explains a virus existing all that time, let alone increasing in fitness for most of history.",1579796490
t3_esrzai,CaptainReginaldLong,"It sounds like you're walking into a death trap. Astronomy is literally the branch of science dedicated to studying celestial objects, space, and the physical universe. Creationism...isn't. If that's the dichotomy/tone you're establishing before a debate which is addressing where science sides, no bueno.  

In addition, if you don't know either the answers to these questions or the explanatory power creationism has for them, you are miles and miles and miles behind astronomy's. 

If it were me, I would not go to toe-to-toe with astronomy, you're not trying to prove astronomy is wrong, correct? Find a way to use astronomical facts/observations to make a case for creationism. That's how you prove where science sides. You don't have to come up with different explanations at all, use astronomy's!",1579796476
t1_ffbokr2,gmtime,"I agree with you as so far as the fundamental tenet of r evolutionism. Common ancestry by means of mutation is still valid within a kind. I will happily accept that lions and cats share the s same feline kind as their ancestor. Note that mutation is then both a drive for diversification and genetic enthropy, as the two are not conflicting anymore. I've got to know this as the degeneration model.",1579796475
t1_ffca5jv,Rare-Pepe2020,"&gt;Different cultures, oceans away, each built pyramids without any knowledge of the other culture's existence. Do we draw the same grand conclusion about those? 

We could. ""The tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1‚Äì9) was probably a ziggurat, or the first type of pyramid, like others still standing in the area (around present-day Babylon). Similar styles of pyramids are found in ancient civilizations all around the world. Evolutionary historians believe that each culture devised the same style of building independently. But it seems more sensible to suggest that they are similar because they all came from the same origin‚ÄîBabel.""

Rather, it is our ability to be hypersocial and to cooperate and therefore have cumulative culture that enables us to build upon the collective intelligence of our communities. 

There are a range of cool experiments that demonstrate that human infants are better than other primates at socialising and being cooperative - e.g. see 

* [Here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1114.full) for a study on cool puzzle boxes: children spontaneously cooperate in a short period of time. Other primates such as chimps and capuchins do not cooperate despite being given longer

This shows that it is not just sheer genius but relying on others and building on acquired knowledge that is key. \[2\] plague hit communities - there are number of cases of plagues hitting smaller communities and killing all the elders with certain knowledge.

t1_fffpdks,vanderZwan,"&gt; The way the genome works tends to favor specialization.

A subtly different, complementary take on this: evolution seems to inherently favor *modularity* 

&gt; *A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.*

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.2863

A lot of complex evolution involves the repurposing existing ""modules"" - so much so that I suspect it's a necessity. And modularity leads to easier specialization. So in this light, the arise of certain features seem more inevitable than others 

Taking your examples, the arise of systems biology and a central nervous systems seems to be a logical consequence of modularity to me, but based *purely* on modularity limbs might not be.",1579948433

If you really want to understand teh answer to your question, you could do far worse than to read the book I mentioned. While it's not directly answering your question, it does spend a lot of time examining exactly what the diffreneces are between chimps and humans, and why they matter. 

WRT to those sign experiments, he spends a fair amount time going in to why the studies were no where near as interesting as people were claiming, but here's a representative  quote from the only actual deaf person who worked on the team communicating with these gorillas by sign language:

&gt; Every time the chimp made a sign, we were supposed to write it down in the log…. They were always complaining because my log didn’t show enough signs. All the hearing people turned in logs with long lists of signs. They always saw more signs than I did…. I watched really carefully. The chimp’s hands were moving constantly. Maybe I missed something, but I don’t think so. I just wasn’t seeing any signs. The hearing people were logging every movement the chimp made as a sign. Every time the chimp put his finger in his mouth, they’d say “Oh, he’s making the sign for drink,” and they’d give him some milk…. When the chimp scratched itself, they’d record it as the sign for scratch…. When [the chimps] want something, they reach. Sometimes [the trainers would] say, “Oh, amazing, look at that, it’s exactly like the ASL sign for give!” It wasn’t.

The studies were textbook cases of confirmation bias. The researchers saw exactly what they wanted to see.

I don't know where you heard this, but that sounds like some serious BS to me. IQ is a human specific test. In fact it's not just human specific, but *culturally specific*. That is one reason why there *appears* to be a difference in IQ between the races. So how on earth can anyone determine that gorillas have a 75+ IQ?

This is of course the $64,000 question.

Each environment offers a variety of niches with exploitable resources at various trophic levels. Evolution tends to fill in each of those niches offer geologic time. Unexploited resources don't go unexploited for very long when life competes.
An illustrative example would be the Tasmanian tiger, a marsupial that filled the niche of a terrestrial predator when none other existential. It's remarkably similar in form to big cats in Africa and to wolves in North America which convergently evolved to fill analogous niches in separate environments.

t1_fffskyl,Rothandle,"Right. But the phenotype forms from the biochemistry to perform the biochemistry. And I'm saying that the inability to form cell membranes to bind organelles, and having genetic material that is a 2d sheet rather than a 1d chain, and being bound to a high-temp high-pressure environment for the sake of it's biochemistry, definitely isn't gonna evolve to meet needs in the same way as life with different biochemistry, because it has a wildly different environment to meet it's different biochemical needs. Photosynthesis won't come into existence underground (duh) and silicon based life won't live above ground. So, you now have an evolutionary chain where the autotrophs don't reach for the sky, crowding for sunlight. Which means the phenotype of what eats them will be different in order to effectively eat them. Which means the phenotype of predators will be different in order to effectively do predation. No membranes and a genetic material that isn't an unzipping chain means that mitosis wouldn't happen in the same way, like at all. And if mitosis doesn't happen the same way, then the path from unicellular to multicellular via colonies of cells dividing but staying connected until eventually developing differentiation isn't gonna be that path. Since a 2d sheet of information doesn't unzip into 2 halves with equal and opposite information encoded creating a template for 2 new DNA strands, meiosis can't occur the same way. Gamete formation and fertilization can't happen the way they do here. Sex may not develop at all. Convergent evolution makes sense with simialir biological needs in similar environments. Changing the biochemistry of the abiogenesis evident necessarily changes the biological needs and where that biochemistry is possible determines the environment life evolves to survive in.",1579892221

If something similar, the cell types/biochemistry, can emerge into many different ways of approaching the same result. Then, even if the biochemistry is different, it would have to evolve under natural selection and mutation. 

Imagine any different starting biochemisty, then why would it end up looking different in appearance? What other systems would it need just becauase it's chemisty is different? If it's life, thus it evolves, it would still need to develop systems for the physical world around it which would lead to the same things we see here (vision, hearing, touch, taste, etc.).",1579891230

t3_etcuy3,nemotux,"I think it depends on how you interpret ""resemble"". If all you mean by ""resemble"" is: will there likely be a general 3-way division between 1) organisms that harvest energy from non-living sources (ie. light, volcanic activity, etc.), 2) organisms that survive by eating other living organisms, and 3) organisms that survive by eating dead organic matter. Then, I'd say, quite likely.

If by ""resemble"" you mean will there be things that look like trees, grass, insects, fish, birds, mammals, etc., I think that would depend on how similar the aquatic and land-based environments are to Earth. For example, if the atmosphere has very erratic and violent winds, perhaps nothing bird-like could evolve. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is calm and substantially denser, making flight easier, it could encourage bird-like creatures to evolve even more prolifically than they have here.",1579890981

This would severely limit silicon’s life-like chemistry.  Maybe you could have something silicon-based that’s sort of alive, but only in the sense that it passes on information. There have been ideas about minerals holding information the way DNA holds information.  DNA holds information in a chain that is read from one end to the other.  In contrast, a mineral could hold information in two dimensions [on its surface].  A crystal grows when new atoms arrive on the surface, building layer upon layer.  So, if a crystal sheet cleaved off and then started to grow that would be like the birth of a new organism and would carry information from generation to generation.  But is a replicating crystal alive?  To date, I don’t think that there is actually any evidence that minerals pass information like this. Maybe deep below the surface of a planet in some very hot hydrogen-rich, Oxygen-poor environment, you would have this complex silane chemistry.  There, maybe silanes would form reversible silicon bonds with selenium or tellurium.",1579890456

Maybe a question that we could try to answer is: If we could run evolution on Earth like a simulation a million times, what percentage of the time would the outcome be similar to what we currently have?

My guess would be - probably a lot. The way the genome works tends to favor specialization. So you'd expect multicellular life to arise, followed by systems biology, limb development and I'd expect centralization of something akin to a nervous system.

If this is some foreign planet though, and the life either doesn't use a genome or has one very different from ours, I think a lot of things are possible.

t3_etanpn,pivazena,"Here's my journey: I have a BA in psychology, minor cognitive science. I had intro biology and intro chemistry from undergrad, AP credit from calculus. I worked in a cognitive neuroscience lab, so I had some lab experience (animals). 

After I graduated, I got a job as a field technician at another university-- that is what made me want to get a PhD. I got another job after the field season was over, this time in a lab. These jobs can be given to anybody with a BA, as long as you have good attention to detail and exhibit a desire to learn and be taught. Background doesn't necessarily matter. I strongly recommend this approach, so that you know what it is to actually do lab or field work. While employed as a tech, I used my benefits to take continuing education courses in ecology and genetics. 

Then I applied to grad programs that did not require the ""big five"" premed courses (Bio, Chem, Orgo, Physics, Calculus) but did require the subject GRE. I did really well on both the GRE and the subject (biology) GRE.

I strongly doubt you will be accepted into any PhD program with your current background. And there are very few jobs in this field. If you want to teach to K-12, get a masters. I will also say that be wary of any program that you do get accepted to, especially if you have to pay your own way. They do not have your best interests in mind. A good PhD program will only accept you if they can see a place for you, and if they have some inkling that you will succeed. Graduate students are a big investment.",1579884075

You could also do the college-level bio/chem/etc at a community college after you graduate and then just apply to a 2-year program.  


But I'd highly recommend looking into a school that has a program for non-science majors with an additional year of pre-reqs.

You reach out to them via email and see if they are taking on students and if your interests mesh well. If that goes well, then you would start an application and they would invite you to their university for an interview (with their lab and usually the department head and a few other professors). There are certainly exceptions, but usually, you really need to have a ""faculty advisor"" that has agreed to take you on as a student before you can get accepted into a PhD program. And you really want to make sure this advisor is someone you can get along with and most importantly, someone that does good research on the topics that you find interesting. 

All of that said, I think you will find it very difficult to pursue a PhD in evolutionary biology without a strong background (i.e. a bachelor's) in biology. Almost all graduate programs in biology include some course work, usually advanced biology topics like population genetics, statistical ecology, genomics, etc and most of these will assume proficiency in undergrad-level bio. 

It's also very common to be funded with a teaching assistantship, so many PhD students are expected to teach intro-level biology to undergraduates. 

I don't say any of this to discourage you. I think a social sciences background would lend a lot of useful perspective to studying evolution.

For example, in your post you talk about how frontal fish fins were most likely a modification of pre-existing gill arches. Now obviously, ""fish biology"" didn't *plan* that modification.

So then it seems like we circle back to my original questions. Why don't we see visible modifications to bone structures that are equivalent to the modification ""attempts""/variations from which the ""gill arch to pectoral girdle"" transition arose?

If such progressive modifications of pre-existing technology are essentially unobservable to the naked eye, how do they resist be drowned out by ""louder"" factors (like immediate reproductive benefits) that would drive selection?

Fungi In an interesting case, as they reproduce asexually by budding off a new clone, by breaking up into fragments and regrowing, or by producing spores, which are a bit like seeds.  But some fungi reproduce sexually as well, every other generation.  That’d be like if you were born, lived your life, cloned yourself when you turned 90, lived a second life, then reproduced with a partner normally and made a child.

When fungi reproduce sexually, it works a bit differently than in mammals, but they do produce something like sperm - haploid cells which can fuse together to form a new fungi cell with merged nuclear DNA from two parents.

Some animals do produce what we’d call sperm, and have a muscle contraction process to eject that sperm out of the body.  Insects and fish are just simpler or older organisms which do this.

On the urination side, all cells excrete waste, so that started first.  Excreting urine specifically, however came later.  Urine is a liquid waste containing urea, which is produced from the ammonia made during metabolism in what’s known as ureotelism.  Mammals and amphibians do this, while other animals like birds rely on uric acid instead.  Insects and fish don’t produce much urea, and fish excrete their ammonia through their gills, so they don’t really urinate.

t1_ffb81a6,river-wind,"This is the key to the answer.  We would likely not see stubby, useless limbs show up in an individual,  then see them slowly develop into full limbs over generations, as is being suggested.  That would be fighting against selective pressure during development, aiming for a goal of extra limbs over time, despite the downside of these “proto-limbs” doing nothing useful in the meantime.

Instead the most likely method of getting more of something you already have would be through a mutation in the DNA controlling how many of those things you get.  So one mutation can result in a complete second set of eyes or wings or legs.  Whether the rest of the body plan can accommodate those extra wings or eyes is another question.

Hox genes in fruit flies can get you extra wings, or legs where antennae should be, while hox-like control genes manage segmentation of the body.

The more complex the original form, the less likely the duplication of tissue will work effectively though: it’s easier for a centipede to have an extra segment with more legs and guts, it would be harder for a human to support a second set of legs on a single pelvis without problems.

In the case of vertebrate limbs, the pectoral girdle was likely a modification of existing gill arches (as is also the case of the jaws), while the pelvic girdle was a modification of the metapterygium found in cartilaginous fish and basal ray-finned fish, which supports the back fins and likely has a role in supporting intromission and reproductive structures.

None of these limb structures spring unbidden from nothing, mutating from protoplasmic stem cells into a proto-leg or proto-wing.  They are evolved through tiny inherited modifications of earlier structures.  Sometimes a novel mutation like a serial doubling of a segment might occur - resulting in multiple limbs that can then be modified (serial homology duplicating entire segments is likely an important driver in the early evolution of arthropods and annelids, and even chordates), but having a functional limb just show up out of nowhere isn't really something that can easily happen.",1579792161

t3_esnz3t,like_the_boss,"To make sure I'm understanding what you're asking, I'll rephrase what I think your question is: if evolution randomly tries stuff out, and that's how we got things like limbs, then presumably we should continue to see little proto-limbs (say little bumps) appearing on some offspring at arbitrary places from time to time as evolution continues to try new stuff?

The simplest answer is that we do. If you want to google 'human mutations' and look at some pictures, I'm sure some of them are genuine.

But you can imagine that, for a creature with no legs, perhaps having a bit of a leg is useful. But for a creatures that already has 4 legs, say, there may not be any advantage in having a 5th leg. It would cost something to build and might just add weight.

So we have probably reached a place in humans where any mutations that arise causing little proto-limbs are weeded out, rather than spreading.

As a more technical point, mutations can only affect the existing 'recipe' encoded in the DNA. So while we can imagine pretty much any change to the human form (proto-limbs, extra fingers, extra eyes, wings etc), these changes are not all equally likely to arise as a result of mutation. As an analogy, if you can change a couple of letters in a recipe for making a cake, there's probably only a handful of changes to the cake you can actually make. You might get it 'LIME' flavoured instead of 'LEMON', but you're not going to suddenly get it 'CHOCOLATE' flavoured. Depending on what the human recipe says, the probability of getting 'proto-limbs' in different places on the body will be different, and in some places it may be vanishingly small.

t3_esnz3t,TheWrongSolution,"The origin of limbs, at least in the vertebrates, is still not a settled debate. Vertebrate limbs (true paired fins) first evolved in the jawless fishes. A few classical hypotheses have been around to try to explain how they came to be, these include 1) the pectoral fins evolved through the modification of gill structures and, 2) both the pectoral and pelvic fins evolved from an ancestral lateral fin fold structure. There seemed to be evidence both in support and in contradiction to either hypotheses. There is yet another ""newer"" hypothesis the details of which I don't exactly recall, so I'll leave it out. What is clear is that many of the genes that pattern the development of paired fins were already in existence and serving other functions in the vertebrate ancestors. So evolving a new fin likely required rearranging the genetic programming of what was already there in the jawless fishes. 

In the invertebrates, limb-like structures have evolved multiple times in different lineages. Interestingly, there are some limb developmental genes that are shared across some invertebrates and vertebrates, despite their limbs having evolved separately. This may suggest that these genes are responsible for some sort of ""outgrowth"" program in the common ancestor. If we just look at the arthropods, we do in fact see structures that we don't normally call limbs (i.e. antennae, pedipalps) to be under the control of the same genes used for making limbs. In a sense, the antenna, popping out of the head, could be thought of as a ""proto-limb attempt"" that got specialized into being a sensory structure instead of a locomotory one.

&gt;The main reason why I ask is because it seems to me that in order for selection to eventually ""fix"", so to speak, the arm to a given location, you would have to try every other possible location at some rudimentary (infinitesimal?) level.

That's not necessarily true, as there can be constraints put upon by the existing body plan of the organism. For instance, bilaterians have broadly bilateral symmetry, so new ""limbs"" would not be expected to grow on just one side of the body. There are likely other developmental constraints that govern where these outgrowths can be located, even before natural selection acts to eliminate these variants.",1579756980
t3_esnae1,Decapod73,"&gt;The way humans did?

I don't accept this part of the premise; MOST primates are omnivorous, and human ancestors were likely no exception.

That said, Yes! many times.

Many large groups of animals that share a common ancestor will show different feeding behaviors, meaning that *something* had to change. Snapping turtles are carnivores, tortoises are herbivores, and red-eared sliders are omnivores. So what was the ancestral turtle? Harvester ants are seed-eaters, leafcutter ants are fungus-eaters, and army ants are strictly meat-eaters. So again, what did the ancestral ant eat?

t3_esnae1,river-wind,"Your premise needs some updates, which is making the answer hard to find.  Plants coming first isn’t correct, and herbivores needing to comes first is also not accurate.  First would have been single-celled chemotrophs, consuming non-living organic compounds.  Then after a long time some kind of simple photosynthetic cells would have come about possibly purple, a variant of which would later be absorbed by other cells to create the chloroplasts of today.  All this would have been slow, with cells for a long time relying on multiple sources of energy/food.

After we finally get to multi cellular life, we already have some cells eating other cells, and some cells living off sunlight.  Multicellular life eating other multicellular life(carnivore) does not need to have happened second.  Plants didn’t come first, so herbivores and carnivores were co-existing from the start; co-evolving next to each other.

Later, when we finally get to more modern body shapes we’re familiar with (think four limbed tetrapods), there are a number of examples of families shifting from meat to plant diets or vise versa.  Gorillas are vegetarian, but their ancestors were not.  Horses are vegetarian, but their ancient ancestors were not.  All mammals stem from a common ancestor which in part was likely an insectivore, or at least a omnivore of some kind.  

There is opportunistic predation even among herbivores.  Cows and deer will occasionally kill and eat small animals.  It’s not common, but it happens.

Yes, which is why the correctly propose that natural selection mechanisms purify non-5mc sites from the population.  


"" Instead, we propose that natural selection maintains methylation to  higher levels than would be expected from a neutral loss-gain process.  Supporting this model, our analysis of *C. neoformans var*. *grubii*  epigenomes demonstrated higher fraction of methylated CGs (median =  0.59) in dual LTR-harboring centromeric retrotransposon (Tcn) sequences  than in non-transposon centromeric sequences (median = 0.24). ""  


""Based on the observed rates of methylation loss and gain, the null model (*s* =  0) would predict an equilibrium fraction of methylated CGs of 0.047.  This is much lower than the observed fraction for Tcn elements (0.59),  consistent with a role for purifying selection. This calculation assumes  that the relative rates of methylation loss and gain measured in the  laboratory generally reflect those of wild populations and that this  ratio is not dramatically different across different centromeric  intervals. We note that non-Tcn CG sequences of the centromeres have a  higher fraction of methylation than predicted by a neutral model, which  may reflect a role for CG methylation in centromere function as inferred  from the TBZ sensitivity of cells lacking 5mC. Together, our  experimental and observational evolutionary studies support with a model  in which 5mC is inherited with high fidelity and that 5mC loss and gain  events in *C. neoformans* act in a manner akin to mutation in  DNA sequence by producing random variation upon which natural selection  acts. As with the evolution of codon bias, selection is likely to be  weak with no requirement that any specific CG site be in the methylated  state.

We did not observe sequence specificity beyond CG dinucleotides for 5mC occurrence in *C. neoformans*: an alignment of methylated sites across the eight genomes described in [Figure 7](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31374-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419313741%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#fig7) reveals only a CG motif ([Figure S7](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31374-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419313741%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#figs7)G). Consistent with this finding, we found that introduced *in vitro* methylated DNA of bacterial origin is well-maintained by Dnmt5 *in vivo*, and purified Dnmt5 methylates artificial DNA sequences *in vitro*  harboring hemimethylated CG dinucleotides. These findings argue that  sharing of methylation sites across phylogeny we observe is not  explained by a detectable requirement by Dnmt5 for particular sequences  beyond hemimethylated CG dinucleotides.""",1579723132

Catania, S. *et al.* Evolutionary Persistence of DNA Methylation for Millions of Years after Ancient Loss of a De Novo Methyltransferase. *Cell* (2020). doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.12.012

The summary since people like clickbait instead of reading the actual study (emphasis mine):   
""Cytosine methylation of DNA is a widespread modification of DNA that plays numerous critical roles. In the yeast *Cryptococcus neoformans*,  CG methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the DNA  methyltransferase Dnmt5. We show that **Dnmt5** displays exquisite  **maintenance-type specificity** ***in vitro*** **and** ***in vivo*** and utilizes similar *in vivo*  cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably,  phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the **ancestral species  lost the gene for a** ***de novo*** **methylase, DnmtX,** between 50–150  mya. We **examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of  DnmtX**. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient  replication of methylation patterns in *C. neoformans*, rare  stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural  selection. We propose that an epigenome has been propagated for &gt;50  million years through a process analogous to Darwinian evolution of the  genome.""  


Quotes from the paper for the kids on here spewing bullshit about the results:   
"" To our surprise, Dnmt5 is a maintenance enzyme *in vitro* with extraordinarily high specificity for hemimethylated substrates. ""  


"" However, we observed that methylation loss after depleting cells of  Dnmt5 was not restored upon re-introduction of the enzyme. This was true  even if Dnmt5 was introduced through a genetic cross. ""  


""Thus, we conclude that 5mC has endured in *C. neoformans* for millions of years through the action of Dnmt5.""",1579722554

The fact that random methylations may contribute to the variation that natural selection acts on even over millions of years is what's new.

I'm not going to saying this study isn't interesting, because it is and I love it, but its also not what you're describing.
 
This fungus is still actively, repeatedly renewing it's methylation using a maintenance methyltransferase Everytime it divides, just like pretty much any other methylating organism does. It's just not modifying it's methylation pattern between cell cycles in the transient style you're referring to with additional methyltransferases. During each division of this fungus some methylation patterns may mistakenly change do to poor copying by it's maintenance methyltransferase, leading to selection opportunities. These same exact kinds of errors can and do occur in any organism that uses maintenance methyltransferase to copy methylation patterns during division, including human cells. It's literally not  new, it's just that in their system which has no secondary, transient methyltransferase activity, there's a more clear picture of how incorrect copying of the template strand methylation pattern can lead to selection opportunities. The major development here is that they have a system to study that so cleanly, not that it's a novel never-before-described ""mode"" of evolution IMHO.",1579722208

Negative frequency selection: this is when the most favorable trait in a population is the one that is the most rare (least frequent). For example, bees like visiting unique flowers. In a meadow where 90% of the flowers are yellow and 10% are purple, the purple ones will be visited more frequently due to the bees sampling different flower types. As a result, they have a high fitness level. Two years later, it may be that the meadow is now 90% purple, 10% yellow. The yellow flowers are now the most rare and will be selected for. 

Phenotypic plasticity: the ability for phenotypes to change based on environmental factors.

t3_ervaav,radenoughay,"Like limbs and organs, emotions evolved to serve certain reasons and got co-opted to serve other purposes by evolution. This makes them a bit complicated.

For simplicity take the case of males. Generally they had to provide resources, commitment, and protection for females to mate with them.

Children are so biologically costly that if females mated with males that were just ""meh"" about them, they would likely have to raise their children without much help from the father. So it makes sense to choose mates which are crazy about them. 

Love is the craze males evolved to convince females about how specially valuable they find them. After all, even if you were the most biased towards liking that female, but someone else was under the spell of a love delusion, then they would commit just about everything for her, and she would end up mating with him instead, as he seemed much more committing.

Some males then have deceitful love, with someone they think they're head over heels with, but once they slept about 20 times (just enough statistically to get her pregnant) he all the sudden falls out of love. He doesn't even know better. 

Some males have true love for her. Love is a signal of how valuable a male finds a partner, and if they actually find them very valuable, they're likely to fall in love. This also means that she is probably quite valuable, and for her this means she's got a lot of good options. This results in unrequited love. A female might enjoy the friendship and attention of a male that's in love with them. And if she were less high in mate value, or he were higher, they might make a wonderful couple. But this is love from the male, designed to elicit sex, but not getting anywhere. 

Mutual love occurs when both partners, due to their personal quirks and values, believe that their partners are a lot more valuable than they actually are in the mating market. This is very rare indeed, but it is what we are all looking for",1579633499

t3_erz0sc,OddJackdaw,"No. It betrays a lack of understanding of how evolution works. 

There are a couple really important things to understand about fossils and their meaning:

First, it is staggeringly unlikely that any given organism will end up being fossilized. It takes very specific conditions for a fossil to occur, so the odds are literally tens of billions or probably trillions to one that a given lifeform will be fossilized when it dies. 

In fact we don't even have fossils for the majority of species that have ever lived. We tend to have lots of fossils for a few species that live in the environments where fossilization is likely, but for any that don't we have few fossils, if we have any at all. 

Second, when considering so called ""gaps in the fossil record"", you need to remember that no mother ever gave birth to a child that was a different species. Every child only varies slightly from it's parent. 

**Speciation is a gradual thing.** It doesn't happen in a single generation. No mother ever gave birth to a different species, but the great, great,........., great grandmother can definitely be a different species. Time is always a requirement in evolution. Again, this is an absolutely fundamental truth of evolution. If a mother did give birth to another species, it would actually disprove evolution, not confirm it. 

Stop and think about what that means... Imagine that we somehow have a true lineage of fossils, a complete record from a particular human all the way back to the first life form on earth. How would you be able to determine when one species became another? You couldn't, because it never happened.

**So it's only because of the incomplete fossil record that the idea of using fossils to identify species even makes sense.**",1579632673
t1_ff64rok,try-the-priest,"Yes. A lot of behaviours that we see in species might not be of evolutionary advantage or disadvantage. It might just be a side effect or misfiring of actual evolutionary adaptation.

That's a very decent and sensible starting assumption - having sex feels good, eating food feels good, getting your finger chopped off feels bad etc. Clearly there is a very strong correlation between good/bad feelings and help/harm to genetic interests.

However, humans are a much more nuanced animal than any other. Whereas all other animals mainly rely on hardcoded behaviours in order to be successful, we rely heavily on culturally learned behaviours. Whereas hardcoded behaviours come with a 'guarantee' that they are reproductively valuable (because what animal would still be around if its hardcoded behaviours were reproductively harmful on average?), humans' learned behaviours come with no such guarantee. It's perfectly possible for a group of humans to follow a course of behaviour that leads to all their deaths (eg the mass suicide at Jonestown https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown)

By and large, our more ancient behaviours and motivations (eg towards sex, food etc) do follow the good/bad feelings paradigm you imply, but we have the ability to cognitively override our ancient promptings - if we couldn't override our ancient promptings, we wouldn't be able to use any learned behaviours, because we'd be constantly pulled back by our ancient ones.

So what you have is an animal that has the ability to override and discount its own negative feelings. Yes I feel pain but I make the cognitive decision to pursue this course anyway, because I have cognitively calculated that it will benefit me in the long term. The pain comes from ancient wiring, the cognitive override comes from the more recent and uniquely developed contingent behaviour abilities.

One of the reasons we excel is precisely because we are able to behave in ways that are superior genetically to the behaviours suggested to us by our evolved psychology. The genes have said, we don't know what kind of a world you will be facing, so here's a cognitive module that can figure out environment-specific behaviours (including a lot of learning from others what useful behaviours they have found). Our feelings tell us the ancient answer, but we can disregard it when we have calculated/believe that we have a course that genetically beats the hard-coded one.",1579541006

My point had nothing to do with that, though. It is as accurate, taxonomically, to call a salamander a fish as it is to call a human one, even if we define fish as a paraphyletic assemblage (excluding tetrapods, for instance). A salamander may have superficial similarities and a degree of plesiomorphism (retention of primitive/ancestral features), but genetically and even outwardly, it is as far “evolved” from what most of us would call fish as any other tetrapod.

To be really pedantic, several living, non-sarcoptyrigian (non-tetrapod-line) fish have developed “limbs”. Frogfish and mudskippers are two very impressive examples but there are actually loads more.

t1_feu4xdy,IamNotFreakingOut,"There is something called deterministic chaos, and I'm sure that your friend has heard of it (at least one example I know in pure math: the Lorentz attractor). It basically means that you can have deterministic laws, simple or complex, but depend heavily on the initial conditions of the system. Biological evolution, much like linguistic evolution, stellar evolution and other systems work in the same way: they're complex systems with complex laws and depend on initial conditions. This is why your model will always be oversimplified. The point is whether your model is closer to reality or not. The authors argue that their new model is better than the previous one. Is it incomplete? Definitely. Does the older model account for more observations? No, on the opposite. If you want to refute this model, do it in a way that proposes a new model that fits more observations, regardless of whether it supports speciation or not. If you find that a criminal investigation report is incomplete, propose a better one, because rejecting it doesn't mean that one goes back to the older report of 'Ghosts killed the man' (which asks more than it can answer). This is important, because it avoids us a great deal of going back anf forward.

On the other hand, as I said it is not my field of expertise, but I know that your article is only proposing a simple phenomenological law. Complex chaotic systems are difficult to study, and we generally use computational modelling to explore a more detailed picture involving lots and lots of data and many interactions. Instead of going into the details of K and L, it should bother you more if you're that pedantic that the equation doesn't take into account the effect of the whole ecosystem: natural selection isn't the only mechanism out there! I'm sure there are more thorough studies than this article, but you need a qualified expert up to date with the bibliography of the subject to give you a better explanation.

Now, to briefly answer your points:

1. Yes, K increases by 100 fold (I thought that was obvious). The more zeros you add to your 1 in a X chance, you add them to your K. That's because 1/log (x/(x-1)) is approximated by x for large numbers. I didn't say it wasn't a big deal, only that its value is beside the point. Notice also that your mean # of rounds depends on L as well, and that millions of years is not huge for evolutionary time scales (know also that you are working with the human genome). Also, given the size of a typical genome and the timescale of mutations, one in trillion seems unrealistic to me, but I can't justify it.

PS: I found this book [Ev. Biology.](https://books.google.lu/books?id=ZobfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=the+ratio+of+favorable+mutations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=64b2KyovfO&amp;sig=ACfU3U1TGtIn85u4ElTVltVpqgLn5-2iwg&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmsOOppI7nAhVMzqQKHb3tCawQ6AEwD3oECAYQAQ), which might be a good read, but I didn't go through it.

Anyway. For this point, the opinions of an expert with more insight regarding the rate of mutation and its fixation in many species are required for your satisfaction (not so sure about your friend though).

1(bis): 
&gt; ""The point that I'm making is that with larger population sizes, it takes longer and is probably more difficult to fix a favorable mutation.""

Well, yes. In that case you no longer work with a fixed population size, and K will be a complex function, and the theorem in the article's appendix would need to be corrected to add all the non-linearities of K and L being functions, and I'm sure it would be unsolvable.

&gt; ""How do we know that in order to account for the fixation of favorable mutations, we simply have to modify our favorable mutation rate ratio""

Because that's how the model is defined. If you ask that, then what you are looking for is another better but complicated model, which, you can feel free to work it out, but the final equation will be messier than those Lagrangians in the Standard Model of Physics.

""In reality, those correct guesses need to be combined into the DNA of real, discrete living organisms. It takes time to propagate the favorable mutations, and there is the chance a favorable mutation doesn't get selected. Again, these are not trivial issues.""

No they aren't trivial. I know it, you know it, and the authors know it. Because, again, the model is NOT reality. The chance of that model being invented in your lifetime is practically 0. So, you can try to find a way to add these complexities, I'm sure the authors thought about them, but adding non-linearities make problems unsolvable. If instead of taking Einstein's field equations and trying to precisely measure the gravitational effects of every stellar object, every particle, you would never solve that equations, ever.

2. Mutations happen at the nitrogen bases, but natural selection doesn't. Natural selection doesn't select mutations (if it did, life wouldn't exist). It is at the genes (or alleles) that are selected and passed, not base pairs. That's why the authors thought about genes as the quanta of their words: you can mutate a into à by a single mutation of a small line.

At the end, your friend who believes in the most unrealistic scenario, demands the most extraordinary proofs for the more realistic scenario. It should be the opposite.

Remember that a ""round of guessing"", based on the values we've chosen to frame our examples, is 1 entire year containing 1 million births. So then, if we estimate a favorable mutation rate of one in 1 million instead of 10,000, then it will take nearly 40,000 years (on average) to arrive at our new favorable ""word"". If the rate is 1 in 1 billion, then it will take nearly 40 MILLION years to arrive at our new word. So \*yes\*, I still think it only begs the question to ""estimate"" a favorable mutation rate of 1 in 10,000, without providing a single source or calculation to back it up.  
(Aside: you said going from 10,000 to 1 million would only increase K by 100. It actually increases K by 100 \*fold\*. That may be what they meant though, so no biggie.)

  
2. I used the term ""assume"" simply to \*note\* the birthrate the authors chose as their example, not to \*connote\* some error. The point that I'm making is that with larger population sizes, it takes longer and is probably more difficult to fix a favorable mutation. How do we know that in order to account for the fixation of favorable mutations, we simply have to modify our favorable mutation rate ratio? If we're trying to arrive at a new ""word"" -- which is the entire genome and not a single gene -- then don't we have to arrive (at some point) at the entire ""correct"" word in one or more actual individuals? It's not enough that we guessed some correct letters in this round of guessing and some more in the next round of guessing and so on... In reality, those correct guesses need to be combined into the DNA of real, discrete living organisms. It takes time to propagate the favorable mutations, and there is the chance a favorable mutation doesn't get selected. Again, these are not trivial issues with large population sizes, as in our example producing 1 million births per year. Suggesting we can just tweak our favorable mutation rate to account for this merely begs the question.

  
3. Your explanation of how they calculated the K was helpful. I was stuck on the term ""letter"" and didn't realize they were just calculating a 1 in 40 chance of guessing the correct letter. Thanks. However, I still think it is an absurd oversimplification to think of the entire genome as our ""word"", and gene loci as the letters. Where it is much more common to discuss in terms of ""letters"" is in either the 4 nucleotide base pairs that compose DNA or the 20 amino acids that each triplet of base pairs codes for. Mutations don't just magically happen to genes -- they are changes to its sequence of base pairs. Reddit even said that a single gene is commonly thousands of base pairs long. So there may be 4-to-the-1,000-power of \*possible\* permutations of a particular gene locus. Not addressing mutations at this level -- and, instead, treating the set of gene loci as our ""word"" -- is, I think, avoiding or obscuring the issue at hand.""",1579383133
t1_feo2owg,JaeHoon_Cho,"Just to elaborate a bit on your response just so that OP doesn’t draw the wrong conclusions:

When you refer to “[our immune system] evolv[ing] a new resistance” or a virus “evolving to adapt”,  that’s not occurring in response to something. Rather, there is variation in the population due to genetic mutations which lead to some hosts being more susceptible or more resistant to pathogens, some of which are more virulent or less virulent. The hosts that end up surviving pass on those traits while the pathogens that are good at infecting hosts go on and spread.

It’s not as if one virus, in response to a resistant immune system, then changes its genetic structure to become more infectious. 

This can be a bit complicated by their being an innate immune system and an adaptive immune system, which I suggest the OP to read up on.",1579381468

t3_eq8jj2,salamander_salad,"Mutations occur for one of three reasons.

1) Chemical. Free-radicals are basically electron thieves and cause oxidation. They're a normal byproduct of respiration and some other processes, and while DNA is normally shielded from free-radicals by the nuclear membrane, during mitosis or meiosis it is exposed to and can possibly suffer damage from free-radicals. DNA has repair mechanisms that usually fix any damage, but it's not always sufficient.

2) Error. Sometimes during meiosis or mitosis chromosomes don't replicate properly. The reasons are numerous, and can be from other mutation factors or physical processes, but it can result in fused or split chromosomes, duplicated chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or stunted chromosomes. 

3) Ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation actually causes damage via two mechanisms: first, through chemical means. Alpha and beta particles and gamma rays ionize the mediums they travel through. When they travel through humans, they ionize the water around them, creating free-radicals. But these particles and rays can also impact and ionize DNA directly, though it's much more unlikely for it to happen. 


So what normally happens with a mutation is that function of affected gene is shut down. Albinos, for instance, suffer from a mutation that stops their bodies from producing melanin. Same thing with blue eyes, but more specific. 

But every so often, a mutation will alter a gene's function rather than stopping it. Non-black people are an example of this, as their gene expression for melanin has been reduced, but not entirely shut down. Inuit peoples have changes in their genome that make their builds stockier (to better retain heat) and their nasal passages longer (to better heat air before it reaches the lungs). 

Even more rarely, a gene or entire chromosome will be duplicated and it won't result in the individual's death or severe handicap. In these cases, natural selection will act on the additional expressed genes and gradually change them over time, often in ways that make them completely unlike the gene/chromosome it was duplicated from. This is likely why every everything that isn't bacteria has more than 1 chromosome pair (with a handful of exceptions). We have 23 pairs, but some animals have hundreds, plants are even more complicated, and fungi are just strange all around.",1579320863

For instance, mutations are caused by specific physical events induced by x-rays, cosmic rays, radioactive substances, some chemicals, and even 'mutator' genes. Not all genes are equally likely to mutate. Some parts of a chromosome are so-called 'hot spots' because of their higher mutation rate. Mutation rates in one direction may be different from rates in the opposite direction at any given site. Mutation effects are non random in the sense that changes have to be consistent with the organism's development processes.

Evolutionarily, stronger immune systems are [usually](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/science/02obsheep.html) favored thus increasing the specie’s overall chance of fighting off a disease. If an organism’s otherwise “strong” immune system isn’t functioning optimally due to deficiencies, fighting off something else, environmental factors, etc. the organism may be unable to elude death, possibly before it’s able to reproduce. Organisms with weaker immune systems may never get exposes to said pathogen and pass on their weaker genes. 


Add that to the addition modern medicine, where people with weak immune systems are able to live long enough to reproduce. Which puts up the question of the physiology of acquired immunity and the exposure to manageable pathogens at the right time in development leads to a strengthened immune system.

And evolution wouldn’t have selected for our ability to distinguish scientifically between different species of venomous/non-venomous arthropods/arachnids, but rather for our ability to detect a gestalt phenotype: multiple jointed legs, exoskeletons, mandibles, etc. 

(2) similarly, there was evolutionary pressure to avoid areas and food sources that were likely to be contaminated—not by interspecies communicable disease per se—but rather by rot (ie bacteria, fungi, etc., that flourish in areas of decomposition and can make one quite ill if ingested). Arthropods (and worms and land molluscs)—venomous or otherwise—tend to flourish in such environments.

It usually goes like this: Do you *really* think that our ***immensely complex*** bodies--an *undisputed* FACT, *there you stand*--that we began as simple, primitive life and ""changed"" into the present-day, complex organism, such organism as modern science has revealed? That ***is*** what the theory requires us to believe.

I think it's likely that we are often (read: as modern humans in the 21st century) afraid of them because they don't match the body plan we come to expect from other animals. Most of our experience with other animals is with other tetrapods, which basically look like us (4 limbs, 2 eyes, 2 ears, a nose, a mouth), or with animals we don't intuitively know are similar to us (fishes, shellfish, barnacles, etc.). Arthropods—specifically those that aren't just buzzing specks in the air to be swatted—are creepy, because they have too many legs, too many eyes, and move entirely too fast for their size. And have you seen a dead spider? The way their legs curl up is creepy and unnatural seeming as fuck.

In short, we are socialized to accept a certain body configuration. Insects and especially spiders (as well as snakes and worms) have all or most of the parts we expect another animal to have, but lie in the space between a comically unfamiliar animal like a sponge or a sea cucumber and a fully realized tetrapod, which creeps us out in the same way a hyper-realistic doll with dead eyes does.",1579234646

t3_epp6yh,npepin,"Another way of flipping the question is ""why are humans attracted to animals like tigers and bears"". I think the answer is that humans and most mammals have similar traits, while insects have very different traits.

You'll notice that there are some pictures of insects that look kind of cute, and certain features like the eyes tend to made grand. Google image ""cute spider"" and you'll see what I mean.

You'll note that artists will create pictures that take the essence of cuteness and apply it rightfully to anything. They can make robots, dogs, rocks, instruments, anything look cute by applying certain abstractions.

A way to think about it is that we have a somewhat preprogrammed idea of what is cute or beautiful, but they are more general criteria than a very strict measurement. A way to put it is that it is very hard for evolution to limit a higher-level sense of perception, say of the perception of beauty, to being only relegated to humans because it requires not just information about beauty, but also information about humans. Moreso, it is likely more efficient to develop to different systems that synergize, a system that can evaluate beauty, and another system that can evaluate humans, and then you get a system that can evaluate a human sort of beauty, as well as a sort of beauty that applies to other species and pretty much anything else.

It is important to note that insects and animals live in completely different realms of existence insofar as their sense experience and with their sexual selection. A lot of insect mating occurs through force and less through courtship, while a lot more of mammal mating involves female choice. Most insects don't have great vision either so there isn't much need for great displays of beauty because they can't be seen. It is like how the naked mole rat does not need to have any bright displays of color or very shiny fur because no other mole rat will see it.

Before anyone responds to my comments with pictures of beautiful insects, yes I agree that is beautiful, but you missed the point of my argument. There are plenty of insect species that do have a lot of mate selection and/or have a high degree of sense ability, and these species tend to have more classical features of beauty. And again, we can also apply an abstract sense of beauty to anything as I argued.

My post here attempts to argue why essentially mammals tend to be more relatable than insects, and it is pretty obvious but at the same time complex.

I am skeptical of the claim that beauty can't be quantified or talked about in regard to science. It's an emotion that can be measured and we tend to have a decent amount of agreement about what humans find beautiful.",1579222792

and:

&gt; One intriguing genome stood out: it was clearly a member of the archaea, but dotted through its DNA were genes similar to those seen in eukaryotic cells.

and:

&gt; But the theory’s proponents suggest that one of these cells could have engulfed a bacterium, with the bacteria then going on to become structures known as mitochondria, which act as an internal power supply in all complex cells today. Bacteria and archaea lack this internal architecture.
&gt; 
&gt; The Japanese team suggest that Asgard’s newly revealed spaghetti-like tendrils could have engulfed a passing bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with it. After several evolutionary leaps, the two organisms could have become one, more complex, cell type – a primitive eukaryote.

So, basically: archaeon with already some typical ""eukaryote-like genes"" engulfed a bacterium which gave rise to the eukaryotes.

Well, that's an old one: it's called the endosymbiotis theory about the origin of eukaryotes and was coined by Lynn Margulis in ... *1966*. The descent of mitochondria from bacteria and of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria was experimentally demonstrated in 1978 by Robert Schwartz and Margaret Dayhoff. This formed the first experimental evidence for the theory.

Again the very next sensational article written by an ignorant journalist thinking a ""breakthrough"" occurred, providing revolutionary new insights.

Similarly, a site like ""sciencemeetsreligion.org"" is going to be limited to approaching the principle from a religious lens. And yes, the spiritual interpretations of the anthropic principle are controversial and problematic. But once those are stripped away the anthropic principle is still useful in applying proper Bayesian thinking about cosmology: we must, by definition, find ourselves in a part of the universe that can support life. Therefore we must take into account survivorship bias. At the same time we must assume that we are in the least extraordinary environment necessary to support life. 

To take an example of the linked PBS Spacetime video: given that a *galaxy* capable of supporting life is vastly more likely to randomly occur than an entire universe, while our observations suggest the latter is true regarding initial entropy at the big bang, that must mean that physics is as of yet ""incomplete"" in this regard.

t1_fefzjvj,WikiTextBot,"**Anthropic principle**

The anthropic principle is a philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it, and that there is hence a survivorship bias. Proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.

The strong anthropic principle (SAP), as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it.

As I eluded to before, I'm not convinced he can claim real organisms would even be able to make ""fitness estimates"" without an accurate model of reality. You should understand that the fact that the simulated organisms can do that does not mean it's possible in reality. If it's not possible, then the entire argument falls apart.

t1_fecvg8c,OddJackdaw,"&gt; I've just had a hard time with the idea that it wasn't directed by an outside influence, 

Few people would argue that Evolution rules out such a possibility. A few would, but most of us will concede that such an external influence is not fundamentally incompatible with evolution. How could we ever prove that what we believe are ""random mutations"" don't have some guiding hand behind them?

&gt; such as a simulation programmer (can't rule out the possibility that we exist in some form outside this universe, and this universe is a simulation supplied to us like in The Matrix movies)

This is a common argument, but it's a really weird one to me. Not because such a thing isn't possible-- it clearly is-- but because it doesn't actually answer any questions. 

If we are living in a simulation, where did the beings who wrote the simulation come from? All you have done is push the explanation further away.

&gt;  a god-type being (not the Christian god, as I reject Christianity), etc. 

While I am an atheist, I do not ""rule out"" a god. 

But the flaw with all three of these questions is simple: **Where's the evidence?**

The time to believe that a given claim is true is when there is evidence supporting that claim. In all three of these claims, you are just making unfalsifiable statements, none of which are actually supported by evidence. 

I can't prove we don't live in a simulation, but I also don't see evidence that we are.  I see overwhelming evidence that the universe at least *appears to me* as a physical, natural world, so I follow the evidence until I have evidence that justifies believing otherwise. 

I can't prove that there isn't a ""god type being"" but, again, I just don't see any evidence that there is one. Contrary to the old aphorism, an absence of evidence *can be* evidence of absence *if we have reason to believe that such evidence should exist.* Depending on the specific god that is being argued for, there are a variety of possible bits of evidence that we can reasonably conclude should be visible, yet none of that evidence actually exists. Of course this doesn't prove a god *doesn't* exist, but it is one of many sound reasons not to believe that one does.

**On the other hand I *do* see evidence that the universe *could be* fully natural, and that life *seems to have have* arisen naturally and evolved naturally.** 

So when faced with various unfalsifiable explanations that are not actually supported by evidence, and one hypothesis that, while certainly not conclusively proven, seems to be well supported by evidence, the rational course is to provisionally accept the one that has evidence. That doesn't mean you have ""ruled out"" other explanations, though. A rational person never stops examining the evidence. 

&gt; And really, it was foolish of me to bring this up HERE, because that's ultimately a philosophy issue, not a science issue. It's entirely possible it was directed by outsides influence, and science has no way to prove or disprove that. Science isn't dealing with that.

While this is true, the fact that something is possible doesn't mean believing in that thing. Just because science can't disprove these possibilities doesn't mean there is evidence supporting them.

&gt; I have to disagree to some extent. If someone makes a claim, and I reject their claim on the basis of incredulity and I haven't seen a convincing argument and/or evidence in support of their claim (not that there isn't, it would be a matter of me not being made aware of it and not grasping it), am I denying their truth claim? If I am, aren't I justified in doing so?

That is actually what I said. You are justified in *questioning* the claim, not in denying it. It is fine to say ""This explanation sounds sketchy to me"", it is not ok to say ""This sounds sketchy, so it must be false.""

I would label your argument here as ""weakly fallacious"". Your reasons for doubting aren't really sound, but the incredulity is natural nonetheless. The reason I raised the fact that it is a fallacy wasn't that you are wrong for being dubious, but only to make you aware of the inherent unsoundness of the position. ""I can't believe that is true!"" is never a good reason to believe something is false. You need actual evidence. 

Remember, if you only look at the readily available evidence, ""I can't believe the earth isn't flat"" is a perfectly sensible statement. Yet anyone who makes that statement today is correctly regarded as a fool. What *seems* possible has little to do with what *is* possible.

&gt;  The burden of proof is on them.

That isn't necessarily true. The burden of proof is on whoever is making the claim. As long as you stick to asking questions, you obviously have no burden of proof (though be wary of what is known as the [""Just Asking Questions Fallacy""](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions)). But if you go one step farther than you have so far, and actually  argue that we should accept the possibility that we are in a simulation, or that there are gods influencing evolution, then you are know making a claim. *You* would then have the burden of proof. 

Edit: I think you may be misunderstanding the scope of my point here. Saying it is a fallacy to question the claim doesn't mean that you should just accept *any* claim unless you have evidence to the contrary. You *only* accept claims that are supported by sound evidence, and that do not have strong evidence to the contrary. 

You are correct that there is a burden of proof that rests on people saying that belief in evolution is justifiable, but given the evidence for evolution, that is not a  hard burden to meet.

I hope that clarifies my position.

&gt; As far as explosion and the 20 million years, yeah, it's just relatively speaking.

It certainly was a period of very rapid development relative to what happened before and after, but we understand how and why that happened. Creationists ignore that, because it is inconvenient to their arguments.

&gt; But if you say the craziness of that time was a result of the rapidly changing environmental conditions rather than evolution at that point being like humans were early on with flying machines with tons of different designs before we settled into using the common setups you see today, then ok.

t3_eoe0fw,snaferous,"Disregarding the immediate present day for a moment, perhaps charm, guile, and ruthlessness were needed for survival amongst prehistoric societies and bands if hominids.  That may then lead to having a group following a ruthless charismatic leader, which may then better the chances of the small group's survival. In prehistoric times killing people to claim their food and shelter, for example, like any other animal would kill or steal food. A more modern example could be found in ancient Iceland. A study I read, proposed in the translation of epic songs and Icelandic poems suggested that most wealth, property, and class were gained through straight up murder, and that's a small society that was very isolated (no wars of conquer). This can be seen in present day obviously, wherever you look.  Many ancient and modern world leaders were and are narcissistic sociopaths.  Many CEO's of major companies are narcissistic, etc.   Perhaps that trait has simply grown exponentially with the population boom in modern times.  I'm sure someone with more knowledge than I have could articulate it better.  I would imagine gods and religions were in part created to combat this seemingly innate human trait.",1578989699
t1_fe61ul4,Ricefan4030,"&gt;People grossly underestimate just how long life has existed on this planet. This video gives you a better idea of just how many chances and how much opportunity life has had to evolve. The short answer is we have had plenty of time to evolve.

&gt;Another thing to consider that is easily missed: The earth isn't special.

&gt;I mean, obviously it's special to us, because we evolved here, but if we had evolved on some other planet, it would be that planet that is special to us, not the earth. So when you consider the number of opportunities, you have to consider the whole universe.

&gt;So how many possible planets could we have evolved on? The latest evidence says a lot. Estimates say there are between 200 billion and 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy has around 100 billion stars. That means conservatively there are about 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000-- 20 sextillion-- stars in the universe and possibly an order of magnitude more. That means that if even 1 in a billion stars has a hypothetically habitable planet that would mean there would be 20 trillion potential planets we could have evolved on. And the latest research into extra-solar planets suggests that number is probably a lot closer to 1 in a hundred than one in a billion.

&gt;Put simply, life has had plenty of opportunities to evolve.

My hangup isn't so much that life itself evolved, as getting from non-life to life honestly seems like a smaller jump than from the earliest life to the biodiversity we have today, even though we have far more evidence for and understanding of the latter than the former.

And remember also, I do think the evidence shows evolution has occurred. I've just had a hard time with the idea that it wasn't directed by an outside influence, such as a simulation programmer (can't rule out the possibility that we exist in some form outside this universe, and this universe is a simulation supplied to us like in The Matrix movies), a god-type being (not the Christian god, as I reject Christianity), etc. And really, it was foolish of me to bring this up HERE, because that's ultimately a philosophy issue, not a science issue. It's entirely possible it was directed by outsides influence, and science has no way to prove or disprove that. Science isn't dealing with that.

&gt;Your argument is what is known as an argument from personal incredulity fallacy. ""I just can't believe it's true, so it must be false!"" Now I realize you aren't actually saying it is false, you are just questioning it. And that's great, it is exactly what you should be doing. But you still need to be aware that you are using fallacious reasoning, and realize the limits of it's utility: Incredulity is a good reason to question, it is not a good reason to deny.

I have to disagree to some extent. If someone makes a claim, and I reject their claim on the basis of incredulity and I haven't seen a convincing argument and/or evidence in support of their claim (not that there isn't, it would be a matter of me not being made aware of it and not grasping it), am I denying their truth claim? If I am, aren't I justified in doing so? The burden of proof is on them.

&gt;The Cambrian explosion is often cited by creationists as evidence against evolution. It's not at all, they just misunderstand it.

&gt;First off, it's not an explosion. It took something like 20 million years. That is a lonnnnnggg time.Again, watch the video I linked above.

&gt;Second, it's not as much of an explosion as it first seems. life was already fairly well diversified before the CE, it is just that the life before the CE did not have bodies that had skeletons, so they had no body parts that could become fossilized under the typical conditions (which are already increidbly unlikely-- see my comment here from yesterday). We have an explosion of new species in the fossil record, because the fossil record itself was new (for the most part).

Thanks for better explaining that! As far as explosion and the 20 million years, yeah, it's just relatively speaking.

&gt;But as for your question, most of those weird ""experiments"" are due to the rapidly changing conditions at the time. Rapid change in the environment leads to rapid evolution. But rapid evolution doesn't mean the evolutionary ""experiments"" will be viable in the long term. Evolution ""tried"" various models, but those things were less efficient in the long term compared with others, so those species became extinct.

More what my thinking was, was that even once it developed successful body plans, systems, etc, it would still have to continue furiously tinkering in order to bring about the biodiversity we have today, and yet that is not what we see. Eventually, the tinkering slowed waaaaaaaaaay down.

But if you say the craziness of that time was a result of the rapidly changing environmental conditions rather than evolution at that point being like humans were early on with flying machines with tons of different designs before we settled into using the common setups you see today, then ok.",1578986205
t1_feaxwu9,Technodreamer,"The likelihood is because in America (and Canada), the vast majority of Asian people are Sino-Tibetan, and not so much Indian (although that is changing!). Near Toronto (where I live), some Indian people refer to themselves as brown people, not really using the word asian.

As other people have pointed out, race is merely a construct, it varies from place to place. Of course people shouldn't go around telling you what to call yourself.

At the same time, the only reasons we continue to divide ourselves is because of racism, language barriers and cultures. Take for example the common Domestic cat (the most common breed iirc) - we don't tend to ideologically separate these cats by their fur colours, geographical location, size, their owners culture or any other factor. They're all basically Domestic cats!",1578984885
t1_fe6di6x,Ricefan4030,"&gt;Evolution is much more incremental than it sounds like you believe it to be. Some of those types of mutations do occur, especially for things like being born with one or no eyes, or three, body parts growing in the wrong places, etc. They're rare, but if you think they don't happen I suspect you haven't really looked. As for scales, that's not going to happen because as far as I'm aware, we don't possess genes that are necessary for that dramatic a difference in skin development to occur. We're not talking a single mutation being necessary, but probably hundreds in very specific areas of our genomes. If strong selection for tougher skin were applied for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it could probably happen. But it will never happen suddenly in a single generation.

Ok, gotcha

&gt;Additionally, developmental pathways in modern animals generally consist of sets of related developmental genes which occur in varying numbers. When a group of them get duplicated, you get an additional body part relatively close to where the original one was. So if you do look for cases where spurious organs are formed, you'll typically find that the extra one is pretty close to where the ""normal"" one would be. Again, it'd take a ton of mutations to get an extra anus on the foot or testes next to an ear compared to getting an extra ear on the side of the head or a spurious anus (probably without a hole) near the functional one. Fun fact, a lot of people have extra, half-formed nipples on their chests. Most of the time they look like a little blemish or a mole or a small patch of hair, and it'd take an expert to really say whether it is just a ""normal"" skin abnormality or an under-developed nipple.

Ok. Let me ask you something: What about the development of wings in dinosaurs? How did all the necessary components of each wing, including muscles, nerves, cardiovascular structures, etc all manage to get put together into a coherent whole when there was never any direction to bring them together? Just somehow, over time, the DNA of some specific individual dinosaurs coded the components to work together and be structured coherently as a wing? That is a LOT of different things that have to be developed independently, and then, they all have to be brought together to work as a coherent system. How did the brains of these dinosaurs acquire the ability to interface with the wing's nerves once it was developed into a cohesive whole? How did the brains acquire the ""programming"" to tell the wings what to do?

&gt;Are there enough people that pretty much every possible mutation is going to occur multiple times across the population every generation? Yes. Are most of these mutations pretty much non-functional? Also yes. Most of the types of changes you want to see would require at least tens of mutations across some very specific genes. While our population can produce each of those mutations individually, it takes time for them to accrue and mix and match in the population to the point where meaningful physical changes are noticeable.

The last sentence helps me to understand this much better.

&gt;Put more simply, evolution really happens and is driven by existing variants mixing and matching in the population over hundreds or thousands of generations. It does not really happen due to completely new mutations immediately producing an entirely new phenotype or structure.

Pardon me if I misunderstood you here, but if it's using existing variants, how do new components, traits, etc pop up? Sure, it isn't immediately producing an entirely new structure, my hangup more has been that with so many different things to develop, and no idea of what will work and what won't, it has to try a lot of different things, and in the process, it will make a ton of missteps, and so it seems it would need a crap ton of trials, and yet with most populations that have spawned new species, it has not had that luxury.

&gt;I would agree, though I'm curious what you think ""significant"" means specifically.

Maybe significant isn't the best word to use? Maybe a better way of putting it is sufficient difference in traits from the original population to render the two populations unable to get together and produce fertile offspring.

&gt;What is the basis for that assumption?

I could be wrong, and I'm willing to admit that, but most animal populations historically have not had huge numbers to start with, if you take a divergent population, their numbers are going to be even less than the already small main population.

&gt;What? No. That's ridiculous. Speciation almost certainly doesn't occur due to adaptions to their new environment. That would only happen if the two populations are still overlapping to some degree and there is selection against hybrids. Speciation (edit: between two truly isolated populations) happens because a sequence of mutations that are neutral within populations occur that aren't ""tested"" against an independent sequence of neutral mutations in the other population, and over time those otherwise ""neutral"" mutations accrue independently to the point where they are no longer compatible between the populations. Most speciation has little to do with the high level physical changes you observe accruing.

So, the incompatibility is more a result of genetic structure incompatibility than observable trait gene incompatibility?

&gt;First off, common sense isn't real. Don't rely on it as an argument. Second, you're flat out wrong here. It's well known and well established that random events (i.e. drift) has a much stronger impact in small populations than large ones. While natural selection (i.e. how good/bad a trait or mutation is) is much more effective and efficient in large populations.

I don't know if I'd completely toss common sense out the window, as it is better to go off of what is common sense at any given point until presented with a better argument or information, which you appear to have done here.

As for what I said, aren't beneficial and negative traits still a part of drift, because a trait popping in or out randomly still has an impact, positive or negative, on survival? Maybe you need to help me understand drift vs natural selection better?

t1_fdtsdex,awkward4bothofus,"&gt; But you are correct that isolation is an important part of speciation. Groups separated long enough will eventually diverge. That separation can be due to a population living in an island. BUT, they would likely need to not have things like canoes to ensure that they were truly isolated. They, and the nearby Nicobarese and Onge GOT to those islands by boat. Other humans managed to sail from Southeast Asia to New Zealand, Easter Island, Hawaii, some from northern Japan appear to have even made it to North America some 20,000 years ago; to think that the Sentinelese got to their island and then never encountered another human group for 60,000 years seems very unlikely. A DNA sample would likely be able to verify that.

Not so sure about your boat theory. I think the OP got it right. The Sentinelese are related to the Aborigenes and are descended from the group that migrated 60K ya when the ocean levels were lower. The Arabian peninsula was connected to the horn of africa and iran and they walked across that and walked all the way to Australia except for a 70 mile stretch between bali and lompoc, the Wallace Line. 

I understand your comment about oceangoing Asians such as the malays who were the first to reach distant Madagascar but you seem unaware of the Sentinelese reputation for summarily killing any outsider they meet, a reputation which bordering cultures say goes back forever. There is a good chance that any admixture from asian seafarers was minimal to zero.

The best way to answer the question is that the Aborigenes are from the same migration and also highly isolated until 200 years ago and they effortlessly interbreed and do not have any apparent unique features which evolved after arriving.",1578978603

t3_enu9p0,Denisova,"Darwin stated that variance occurs in any population. We now know this happens due to genetic mutations. When the living conditions change, mutations are favoured that match those new environmental demands. This is called adaptation to new environmental conditions. Such a subpopulation gradually starts to diverge from the other subpopulations still existing in areas where the living conditions didn't change. 

Individuals that are born that don't match those new living conditions have less chance to survive and/or reproduce successfully. They ""fit"" those conditions less, hence, 'survival of the fittest'.

After a while of divergence going on, this subpopulation may split off, a new species is born.

This means that each population has some variance. Because genetic mutations always happen, in each newborn individual. 

When those mutations don't mismatch the living conditions, they will not lead to less fitness and thus will stay. So any living environment allows a lot of variance without leading to speciation.

That allows differences in personalities as well.

But different traits *within* the same species also has multiple upsides for the total species to survive - different talents and skills greatly contribute to the wellness and survival chances of the group.

t3_eo1bed,Denisova,"Correct wording: all human are the same *species* and according to modern genetics there are no sub-species among humans (normally referred to as ""races"" - but as a term not in use anymore in genetics apart from botanics). and here's why:

1. the total genetic variance among humans is extremely small, though not entirely unique for humans, it's also found in other extant animal species. Genetics explains this as a genetic bottleneck and by intrapolative estimates date it back some 70,000 years and a total human population of some few thousands of breeding pairs (or even less) max. A genetic bottleneck occurs when the total population reduces considerably due to any cause (climate, disease, natural disasters like massive volcanic eruption etc.). Many studies point out that humans went through such genetic bottleneck.

2. such a genetic bottleneck, reducing the total population to a mere few thousands of interbreeding pairs, qualifies as close to ""endangered species"", [according to the official definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species#Criteria_for_.27Endangered_.28EN.29.27_.5B7.5D).

3. and when geneticists conclude that genetic diversity among humans is very small, [they *really* mean very small](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2012-03-02-chimps-show-much-greater-genetic-diversity-humans). The genetic diversity in humans *over all continents* is SMALLER than among two chimpanzee populations from different habitats found in the same country (Cameroon), *separated only by a river*. The same has been found among bonobo populations in Guinee.

4. even more, of all genetic variance in humans, 85% is due to differences *among individuals of the same continental population*, whereas differences between continental groups account for only 10% of the overall genetic variance (the remaining 5% due to other factors). That means the total inter-continental, genetic diversity is only 10% of the human genome. A genome that in itself is already small in diversity.

5. several genetic studies, [including this one](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/602.full) and [this one](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/9/1679.full), both also further referring to many other similar studies, show that indeed there are gene variants that can be traced back to particular continental groups. But often one particular gene variant points out to more than 1 continental group. Moreover, a gene variant A may be linked to continental group X while gene variant B to continental group Y. 

6. To account for subspecies though, we expect at least **a whole bunch of gene variants** to link to the same continental group. To make things worse, applying different genetic markers, will link the same gene variant A to different continental groups. And so on. The boldly marked phrase above is the quintessence most people simply don't get. 

7. this general pattern, as observed, made geneticists to drop altogether the idea that within human population subspecies (""races"") are distinguishable. ""Races"" in human populations do not exist genetically spoken.

8. moreover the very most of genetic variance in humans [is found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953791) ([also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067985/)) *within* the sub-Saharan population. This [also applies to phenotype variance](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070718140829.htm) (phenotype is the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest)). In Sub-Saharan Africa (~12% of the total world population) more than 2,000 distinct ethnolinguistic groups live, representing nearly a third of the world’s languages. *If* races exist among humans, purely based on genetic variance, some 5 must be found within the Sub-Saharan population, the *rest of the world* constituting the 6th one. You see the problem here.

9. also many traits associated with ""race"" changed last few tens of thousands considerably. The evidence that the early European population was rather *dark*-skinned up to no more than ~8,500 years ago, starts to grow [as DNA studies show](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/03/13/016477.full.pdf).

&gt; ""Survival of the fittest"" is a phrase that originated from Darwinian evolutionary theory as a way of describing the mechanism of natural selection. The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as ""Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.""

which is pretty much exactly what I said. If you can find a contradictory explanation/definition from a better source, I'd be interested in seeing it.

Natural selection is a local optimizing process, but it is not, and cannot be, a global one unless you have a near infinite population with all ""possible"" variants present at high enough frequency that they can't go extinct. Or if fitness landscapes (in the sense of evolutionary algorithms, not biological fitness) are monotonic with respect to natural selection and reproduction, which, given that sign epistasis exists, is pretty trivially not the case.

Regardless, my point that substantial variation in a trait is indicative that observed variation hasn't mattered (much) for reproductive success for a fair amount of time is still true.",1578950920

t3_eo1bed,yerfukkinbaws,"You and your colleague would benefit from a more careful consideration of the terminology you're using.

""Sub-species"" is a formal taxonomic rank. There are no formally recognized sub-species of *Homo sapiens*, which means that all living humans belong to the same grouping at the sub-species level. Sometimes a subspecies *Homo sapiens sapiens* is used to emphasize this, but that name really only has meaning if other named subspecies exist and they do not.

""Breed"" means something totally different, though. It's not an equivalent term to ""sub-species."" Breeds refer to variation in domesticated animals that result specifically from selective breeding. I've heard different accounts about whether there was any selective breeding of black slaves in the New World, there may have been, but even if there was the term breed still can't be applied to the descendants of Causasians, East Asians, or even Africans as a whole.

""Race"" is another term that again has a different meaning. In a biological context it refers to variation within a species associated with geography or ecology but without a formal place in taxonomy. The variation may be caused by either natural selection or genetic drift. It's equivalent in many ways to other terms used to refer to variation within species like ecotype, morph, or variety. These are all forms of what's called structured variation. Variation within a species is said to be structured when knowing something about the environment allows us to predict something about an organism's genetics or vice versa. Unstructured variation is randomly distributed, so doesn't allow predictions.

There's certainly structured variation within humans. Products like 23andMe rely on it as do many medical screens. Genetic structure tends to be found at many hierarchical scales, though, from individual family lineages through regional and ethnic groups through larger groups like sub-species or races and ultimately even to the species and genus levels.

So the real question is whether there's any significant variation in humans at a siimlar scale to the traditionally identified races. There's not really any agreement on exactly how many races of humans there's supposed to be or what they are, but the scale is apparent. Something like 4-6 races. There does seem to be genetic structure at this scale for humans. Research has supported the Sahara Desert, Himalayas, and Bering Strait as geographic features associated with human genetic structure. The problem is really that the genetic clusters at this scale are not especially well-matched to any of the popular conceptions of the races. There's some overlap, but also a lot of inconsistency. Rather than trying to redefine ""race,"" some researchers have preferred to refer to these as ""continental groups,"" which is obviously not very accurate either, but at least gets the scale across.

Maybe more importantly, the structure at this scale (continental groups, races, etc.) is just not all that pronounced and so doesn't allow us to make strong predictions. There's much more biologically informative structure when we look at smaller scales, like those that might be associated with ethnicity. This has also been called ""regional variation"" since current ethnicities are not perfectly aligned to this level of structure just like race isn't perfectly aligned with the continental variation.

&gt; the evidence shows that mixed race humans tend to have less genetic diseases on average, which you wouldn't expect to see if we were actual different breeds/sub-species.

I'm not aware of the research you're referring to, but it would not be unexpected for the offspring of different genetic lines to have more robust phenotypes. This is very common actually. It's called heterosis and results from higher genetic diversity in the offspring of diverged lineages.

If there was no structured variation in humans, the expectation should obviously be that the children of mixed-race parents would be statistically indistinguishable from children of same-race parents.",1578941842

In layman's terms, no.

The level of genetic variation between the traditionally defined continental races isn't large enough to surpass a ""subspecies threshold""

&gt; Table 2 confirms the reality of race in chimpanzees using the threshold definition, as 30.1% of the genetic variation is found in the among-race component, a result expected from the pairwise analysis shown in Table 1. In contrast to chimpanzees, the five major “races” of humans account for only 4.3% of human genetic variation – well below the 25% threshold. The genetic variation in our species is overwhelmingly variation among individuals (93.2%)

&gt;The threshold definition also requires sharp genetic boundaries between the “races.” ...The gene flow arising from long-range migrations and isolation-by-distance has obscured any sharp boundaries that may have temporarily existed after the founder events (Figure 2) as well as has reduced the quantitative amount of genetic differentiation. Consequently, neither aspect of the threshold definition is satisfied; there are no sharp boundaries separating human populations, and the degree of genetic differentiation among human groups, even at the continental level, is extremely low. Using the threshold definition, there are no races in humans.

and they don't exist as independently evolving populations

&gt;Turning to the lineage definition, Figure 2 is consistent with an isolation-by-distance pattern
and not a tree-like structure. Hence, using the same criteria for rejecting the racial status of
the traditionally named subspecies of chimpanzees from equatorial Africa, the existence of
human races as evolutionary lineages is similarly rejected... Figure 2 reveals that human genetic distances fit an isolation-by-distance model. Consequently, it is not surprising that when Behar et al. (2010) sampled Old World populations more finely and used the computer program STRUCTURE, most individuals showed significant genetic inputs from two or more populations, indicating that most human individuals have mixed ancestries and do not belong to a “pure” group. The “races” so apparent to many who cited Rosenberg et al. (2002) simply disappeared with better sampling

&gt;On a time scale of tens of thousands of years (the temporal resolution of the MLNCPA studies), there is not one statistically significant inference of splitting during the last 1.9 million years. Hence, the null hypothesis of a single human lineage is not rejected, so there is no evidence for lineage races in humans. Furthermore, ML-NCPA strongly rejects the null hypotheses of no gene flow and no admixture under the null hypothesis that isolated lineages did exist, so there is strong evidence against lineage races in humans. Hence, there are no races in humans under the lineage definition.",1578927421

The effective population size is the number of individuals that an idealised population would need to have in order for some specified quantity of interest to be the same in the idealised population as in the real population. Idealised populations are based on unrealistic but convenient simplifications such as random mating, simultaneous birth of each new generation, constant population size, and equal numbers of children per parent. In some simple scenarios, the effective population size is the number of breeding individuals in the population. However, for most quantities of interest and most real populations, the census population size N of a real population is usually larger than the effective population size Ne.

**Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model**

The Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model, also known as Dobzhansky-Muller Model, is a model of the evolution of genetic incompatibility, important in understanding the evolution of reproductive isolation during speciation and the role of natural selection in bringing it about. The theory was first described by William Bateson in 1909, then independently described by Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1934, and later elaborated in different forms by Herman Muller,  H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets.The Dobzhansky-Muller model describes the negative epistatic interactions that occur between genes with a different evolutionary history. These genetic incompatibilities can occur when populations are hybridising. When two populations diverge from a common ancestor and become isolated from each other, thus meaning there is no interbreeding between the two, mutations can accumulate in both populations.

***

**Genetic drift**

Genetic drift (also known as allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect) is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.

t1_fe6afto,WildZontar,"&gt; Just think about how many coding differences, including new ones, there are between us and the common ancestor that us and chimpanzees trace our lineage to. You'd be seeing people with 2 eyes, 3 eyes, 4 eyes, 5 eyes, testicles growing under their ears, the left side of the body covered in scales, the right side with hide, anuses that lead to nowhere on the top of their feet, I'm talking like abominations.

Evolution is *much* more incremental than it sounds like you believe it to be. Some of those types of mutations *do* occur, especially for things like being born with one or no eyes, or three, body parts growing in the wrong places, etc. They're rare, but if you think they don't happen I suspect you haven't really looked. As for scales, that's not going to happen because as far as I'm aware, we don't possess genes that are necessary for *that* dramatic a difference in skin development to occur. We're not talking a single mutation being necessary, but probably hundreds in very specific areas of our genomes. If strong selection for tougher skin were applied for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it could probably happen. But it will never happen suddenly in a single generation.

Additionally, developmental pathways in modern animals generally consist of sets of related developmental genes which occur in varying numbers. When a group of them get duplicated, you get an additional body part relatively close to where the original one was. So if you do look for cases where spurious organs are formed, you'll typically find that the extra one is pretty close to where the ""normal"" one would be. Again, it'd take a *ton* of mutations to get an extra anus on the foot or testes next to an ear compared to getting an extra ear on the side of the head or a spurious anus (probably without a hole) near the functional one. Fun fact, a lot of people have extra, half-formed nipples on their chests. Most of the time they look like a little blemish or a mole or a small patch of hair, and it'd take an expert to really say whether it is just a ""normal"" skin abnormality or an under-developed nipple.

&gt; There are 8 billion people on this planet, and they are all just about the same. There's some minor differences, but you do not see a lot of variety. If evolution was taking the amount of shots in the dark it would take to bring about the biodiversity you see today, you'd see a lot more variety in the population, and yet, you don't.

There are two issues here. First, the amount of variation in humans is small because we went through a population bottleneck sometime in the past few hundred thousand years, where the entire population of our ancestors got down to a few thousand individuals. It wasn't until the past few tens of thousands of years that our census population size started growing, and only the past hundred years or so where billions became a number to describe the number of people that are alive. While mutations are always happening, each person only has somewhere around 50-100 new mutations that their parents didn't. Out of a bit more than 3 billion base pairs. Even now our [effective population size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_population_size) is only on the order of 10,000 individuals. By comparison, chimpanzees (who did not go through a bottleneck as recently as we did) have an effective population size of 20,000 individuals.

Are there enough people that pretty much every possible mutation is going to occur multiple times across the population every generation? Yes. Are most of these mutations pretty much non-functional? Also yes. Most of the types of changes you want to see would require at least tens of mutations across some very specific genes. While our population can produce each of those mutations individually, it takes time for them to accrue and mix and match in the population to the point where meaningful physical changes are noticeable.

Put more simply, evolution really happens and is driven by existing variants mixing and matching in the population over hundreds or thousands of generations. It does *not* really happen due to completely new mutations immediately producing an entirely new phenotype or structure.

&gt; It takes significant enough change in traits that members of two different populations can no longer breed and produce fertile offspring + an environment that allows survival of changed traits in order for speciation to occur and stick. 

I would agree, though I'm curious what you think ""significant"" means specifically.

&gt; Generally, when a group of members of a species becomes separated from the original population, their numbers are going to be slim.

What is the basis for that assumption?

&gt; And yet, you are telling me that somehow, when that group settles in its new home and starts having children, that just the right changes, which fit the new environment, which makes them different enough from the original population that they can no longer breed with the original population and produce fertile offspring, manage to happen in enough of members of the species, and that this has happened over, and over, and over, and over, since at least the Cambrian? I'm sorry, but that's just absurd when evolution is just taking shots in the dark and having to experiment with so many different components. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's highly improbable.

What? No. That's ridiculous. Speciation almost certainly doesn't occur due to adaptions to their new environment. That would only happen if the two populations are still overlapping to some degree and there is selection against hybrids. Speciation (edit: between two truly isolated populations) happens because a sequence of mutations that are neutral within populations occur that aren't ""tested"" against an independent sequence of neutral mutations in the other population, and over time those otherwise ""neutral"" mutations accrue independently to the point where they are no longer compatible between the populations. Most speciation has little to do with the high level physical changes you observe accruing. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateson%E2%80%93Dobzhansky%E2%80%93Muller_model

&gt; This is just common sense and logic; the smaller a population is, the more prounced effect positive or negative events, changes, and designs will have on that population.

First off, common sense isn't real. Don't rely on it as an argument. Second, you're flat out wrong here. It's well known and well established that random events (i.e. [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift)) has a *much* stronger impact in small populations than large ones. While natural selection (i.e. how good/bad a trait or mutation is) is much more effective and efficient in large populations.",1578887727

t1_fe63u7t,Ricefan4030,"""Why are you assuming our heart is optimal? Most reptiles (including birds) and amphibians have a much different circulatory system, with a heart that has 3 chambers, not four. In fact, in many ways their circulatory system is much more efficient than ours. The structure of fish hearts are also very different from ours. Invertebrates don't even have hearts. So are there differences in developmental gene sequences that affect how many chambers are produced? Certainly there are.

There is a common misconception that evolution is an optimization procedure and thus produces optimal structures. This is completely false. Evolution is process which searches solution spaces, and natural selection causes that search process to stick around at solutions that are ""good enough"". There are a ton of ""good enough"" solutions to pretty much any biological problem, which can readily be seen when you start comparing structures with similar function across very distantly related lineages.

Good point, my apologies for using optimal. I was aware that evolution works via ""good enough"", not ""optimal.""

""So a big part of why you are struggling to understand how evolution works is that you are looking at the probability of all the specific outcomes we observe, and concluding that it all must have happened exactly this way and no other way. This is not a good perspective. Rather you need to understand that there are many many many possible ways that evolution could have occurred, and the patterns of diversity that exist today are just one random roll of the dice among the huge number of possibilities.""

Mmm, I don't know if this is entirely accurate. I don't think I'm saying ""It couldn't have been any other way."" I think more what my hangup is, is that if evolution is a blind, undirected process taking shots in the dark, in order to bring about the biodiversity we have today, it would have to do a lot of tinkering and experimenting, it couldn't just ""sit back"" and keep doing the same things over and over again. And yet, complex organisms have so many different components, processes, structures, etc, and so in order to find the right combinations that are good enough to survive in a given environment, it would have to do a lot of tinkering, and yet, there's not a lot of tinkering going on in, there's not a lot of variety and bizarre mutations within a given species' living population at any given moment.

Just think about how many coding differences, including new ones, there are between us and the common ancestor that us and chimpanzees trace our lineage to. You'd be seeing people with 2 eyes, 3 eyes, 4 eyes, 5 eyes, testicles growing under their ears, the left side of the body covered in scales, the right side with hide, anuses that lead to nowhere on the top of their feet, I'm talking abominations. 

That's not to say it couldn't arrive at where we are today, just that it arriving at where we are today just taking shots in the dark with so many different aspects of an organism's blueprint with the number of members of a population that we see with most species at any given time seems improbable. If it had huge numbers to work with, then it wouldn't seem all that improbable.

""I think you are under-estimating how often spontaneous early abortions (i.e. miscarriages) occur. It's been estimated that somewhere around 20% of human pregnancies result in miscarriages, just that a lot of them happen so early that the woman doesn't even know she was pregnant. Other animals likely have similar numbers. The weird and bizarre mutations you are expecting to see absolutely do occur, but usually they are fatal before the animal is born or even very developed past a zygote, which is why you don't see them walking around.""

Good point, but that still leaves us with so many components which aren't fatal early on if they aren't good enough, for evolution to keep wildly experimenting with, and yet, we don't see that in just about any animal, human or otherwise.

There are 8 billion people on this planet, and they are all just about the same. There's some minor differences, but you do not see a lot of variety. If evolution was taking the amount of shots in the dark that would be required to bring about the biodiversity you see today, you'd see a lot more variety in the population, and yet, you don't.

It takes significant enough change in traits that members of two different populations can no longer breed and produce fertile offspring + an environment that allows survival of changed traits in order for speciation to occur and stick. Generally, when a group of members of a species becomes separated from the original population, their numbers are going to be slim.

And yet, you are telling me that somehow, when that group settles in its new home and starts having children, that evolution manages to make enough of the right changes which work for the new environment and which makes them different enough from the original population that they can no longer breed with the original population and produce fertile offspring, and manages not to make enough of the wrong changes, and that somehow this has happened over, and over, and over, and over throughout history since at least the Cambrian? I'm sorry, but that's just absurd when evolution is just taking shots in the dark and having to experiment with so many different components. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's highly improbable.

Think about it like this:

I have a species, call it Alfa. A group of members of Alfa become reproductively isolated from the main population via geography; we'll call this group Alfa-1. Then, another group of members of Alfa become reproductively isolated from the main population via geography; we'll call this group Alfa-2.

Alfa-1 has 100,000 members.

Alfa-2 has 1 trillion members.

If I'm evolution and taking shots in the dark, in order to get Alfa-1 and Alfa-2 so different that they are each unable to produce fertile offspring with members of the main population of Alfa, and thus create two new species, I'm going to have to do all kinds of tinkering. Some of the changes I make will work, some of the changes I make won't. The changes that don't work will have a much bigger impact on Alfa-1 surviving than they will on Alfa-2 survival. This is just common sense and logic; the smaller a population is, the more prounced effect positive or negative events, changes, and designs will have on that population.",1578885434

t1_fe63eml,aikiwiki,"&gt;Answer me this - Here's a quote from the article: The “Fitness-only” strategy: In this strategy, the organism makes no attempt to estimate the “true” world state corresponding to each sensory state. Rather it directly computes the expected fitness payoff...How do we know this is possible outside of that simulation? 

Because we know only two basic possible strategies exist outside of the simulation in nature, one in which verdical truth is represented via selection, and one where fitness strategy is selected. I don't mean to be crass, but it doesnt appear that you spent much thought on this, the answers to your questions are implicit in his study.

&gt;How do you estimate fitness without first estimating the world state somewhat accurately? 

Fitness = passing on genes. Don shows how fitness selection itself has no commitment to show us the truth, just enough truth so we can survive and mate.

&gt;Of course it's possible in the simulation because the organisms are just simulated functions that have access to the fitness information.

? They are competing against organisms that have the verdical function. If you are going to question evolutionary game theory, I can't argue with you. However, if you accept evolutionary game theory, then there is only one logical conclusion.

&gt;Here's what I'd say about this. In this metaphor, even though the ""deeper"" truth is code, that doesn't mean the top level interface is not causal. My character shoots its gun and another character dies. This is a perfectly reasonable and accurate description of a cause and effect. 

It is perfectly reasonable - in the game. However, you can't determine anything about the hardware of the computer or the underlying code by using the language of the pixels on the screen. The pixels on the screen hide the complexity of the underlying reality, because you dont need to see it or even know that it is there for you to play the game.

&gt;You can describe it on the level of code, that my input is translated through code into graphics depicting a firing of a gun and so on, but that doesn't make the top level description wrong.

I think you are misinterpretting Don's theory, he is not saying the top level description is wrong either, he is only saying it is not the deeper causal reality, which the interface purposefully hides. That is the metaphor. 

&gt;See, this is the issue with this metaphor. You took it too far. You're assuming that studying physics from our current perception of the world is akin to something like figuring out how a processor works from studying MS Outlook. There's just no reason to think that. We are able to study the world and make accurate predictions about how it works, and that means that we're understanding how it works on that level of study.

I'm not assuming anything, I am just communicating Don's theory; and his theory does not state that physics is wrong. he is saying that objects in time and space are remnants of our perception and how evolution shaped perceptions to verdical truth is zero. he also cites contemporary though leaders in physics who also believe time and space is doomed in a unified theory.

&gt;Or laws of physics don't ""break down"", and you may be confusing scientific issues. ""Unified theories"" is what physicists call it when we arrive at a model that explains multiple phenomena previously thought to be separate. One example is electricity and magnetism (which we now call electromagnetism). If you already knew all that, apologies if that sounded condescending. 

?? I am very clear where laws of physics break down when we attempt unification of our theories, please dont turn a non controversial comment into a unnecessary debate on something we agree on. ""break down"" is my word choice, it would be more correct to say that both QM and Relativity cannot both be true in a singularity, at least one of them is wrong.

&gt;Secondly, the fact that we don't have an explanation for consciousness yet does not mean physics breaks down. 

That's not what is being suggested. As physics seeks a unified theory, the idea of ""time and space is doomed"" is an intrinsic issue top scientists are facing, so this is not even his original scientific thinking. https://pswscience.org/meeting/the-doom-of-spacetime/

&gt;To even put consciousness in the realm of physics rather than neurobiology is a leap (one that Deepak Chopra and Don make gleefully at every turn).

I'm not sure its a leap to put it in physics at all, there is a branch of physics called psycho physics, and consciousness is amendable to mathematics.  I think you mean to separate consciousness from neurobiology is a leap. And that is the point, Don's theory is saying that the hard problem of consciousness is not solvable because the deeper underlying reality is not physicalism. It is impossible to model consciousness and boot it up from physical states, and that is why the science has stopped on consciousness without making much progress. I can understand that seems counter intuitive - but his argument and formula offers something that can be dissected at least, and it does solve the hard problem of consciousness.

&gt; I have no idea how you can claim his hypothesis is falsifiable.

Well, its not my claim, it is his. Why is it hard to understand? He has a working mathematical of consciousness that offers predictions, hence testable. he mentions these predictions frequently.

I hope you understand I am not arguing that his hypothesis is true. I don't know - however as someone who is deeply interested in the philosophical and scientific study around consciousness, intelligence, etc and especially the hard problem, this guy is the first exciting thing to come out of the field in a very long time, so that is why I am investing time in understanding the critiques against it.",1578883908

&gt; And yet, in reality, we see many species who never have large population numbers, and yet somehow, most of them manage to be healthy and well put together enough to survive, with failures being on the left side of the bell curve.

When you talk about the probability of a mutation occurring, are you talking about the probability that the mutation will occur *in any one specific critter*, or are you talking about the probability that the mutation will occur *at all, in* ***any*** *critter?* These are rather different probabilities.

&gt;I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous.

t3_enwx9m,OddJackdaw,"&gt; Here's why I think that: Even in organisms with massive population numbers, the blind process of evolution simply has not had enough opportunities to take shots in the dark and tinker to successfully bring to bear all the components of a given species' body.

People *grossly* underestimate just how long life has existed on this planet. [This video gives you a better idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI7SbZx_Qiw) of just how many chances and how much opportunity life has had to evolve. The short answer is we have had plenty of time to evolve.

Another thing to consider that is easily missed: The earth isn't special. 

I mean, obviously it's special *to us*, because we evolved here, but if we had evolved on some other planet, it would be  that planet that is special to us, not the earth. So when you consider the number of opportunities, you have to consider the whole universe.

So how many possible planets could we have evolved on? The latest evidence says a lot. Estimates say there are between 200 billion and 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy has around 100 billion stars. That means *conservatively* there are about 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000-- 20 sextillion-- stars in the universe and possibly an order of magnitude more. That means that **if even 1 in a billion stars has a hypothetically habitable planet that would mean there would be 20 trillion potential planets we could have evolved on.** And the latest research into extra-solar planets suggests that number is probably a lot closer to 1 in a hundred than one in a billion.

Put simply, life has had plenty of opportunities to evolve. 

Your argument is what is known as an argument from personal incredulity fallacy. ""I just can't believe it's true, so it must be false!"" Now I realize you aren't actually saying it is false, you are just questioning it. And that's great, it is exactly what you should be doing. But you still need to be aware that you are using fallacious reasoning, and realize the limits of it's utility: Incredulity is a good reason to *question*, it is not a good reason to *deny*. 

&gt; I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous. And yet, that is not the case.

The Cambrian explosion is often cited by creationists as evidence against evolution. It's not at all, they just misunderstand it. 

First off, it's not an explosion. It took something like 20 million years. That is a *lonnnnnggg* time.Again, watch the video I linked above. 

Second, it's not as much of an explosion as it first seems. life was already fairly well diversified before the CE, it is just that the life before the CE did not have bodies that had skeletons, so they had no body parts that could become fossilized under the typical conditions (which are already increidbly unlikely-- [see my comment here from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/engh1b/a_question_about_extinct_species/fdzpjle/)). We have an explosion of new species *in the fossil record*, because the fossil record itself was new (for the most part).

But as for your question, most of those weird ""experiments"" are due to the rapidly changing conditions at the time. Rapid change in the environment leads to rapid evolution. But rapid evolution doesn't mean the evolutionary ""experiments"" will be viable in the long term. Evolution ""tried"" various models, but those things were less efficient in the long term compared with others, so those species became extinct.

t1_fe05d0u,aikiwiki,"Hi, thanks for your reply. I've been spending lots of time with his theory so working through it in discussion is helpful.

&gt;This conclusion is in no way simple, nor is it valid in my opinion. He bases this argument on a simulation (detailed here http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FitnessBeatsTruth_apa_PBR) that does pretty poorly to actually simulate anything real.

I'm just not seeing that from what you are arguing against here, and I want to understand reasoned rebuttals against his theory.


&gt;If one of your strategies is straight up optimize for fitness, and the other is doing that but with other limitations, of course the one optimizing just for fitness is going to have the highest fitness.

I think that is exactly what he is suggesting, evolution optimizes for highest fitness, and we have assumed fitness = verdical perception so it is hard to see how that invalidates his model.

&gt;The question is, does this represent anything real? 

That is exactly his question for his proof, and after running hundreds of thousands of simulations pitting fitness strategy versus verdical strategy, verdical was outcompeted in all them.

&gt;I would say that they haven't done enough to show that. For example, it may very well be impossible to predict the fitness of a behavior without your inner model of reality approximating its true nature, making the fitness-only strategy impossible. This is just one possible way to put a kink in their conclusion.

I'm not sure how what you are suggesting is not already implied in their simulations, it is specifically why they pitted ""select for reality as it is"" versus ""select for fitness"". If what you are saying is true, then one of them would not have outcompeted the other and they would have tracked similarly.

&gt;The problem is that the way he is using the metaphor is flawed and misleading. Let's take his video game example. You would agree that as a character in a simulated world like a video game, you're not peering into the ""true nature of your world"" unless you see the code, basically. However, that doesn't mean that the top level user interface isn't 'true' on some level. 

Again, that is exactly what Don is saying, it is true on one level, but it is NOT true if you want to view the actual causal reality behind the video game.

&gt;You can still see how the physics engine works by observing objects, for example, and you may even be able to write equations describing those top-level phenomena that may come really close to the code itself. You can actually try it yourself, platform games have a pretty rudimentary physics engine that you can try to estimate based on observing and playing the game. You can get pretty close to how the code works.

Honestly, I find Don's model far more plausible and non controversial than what you are suggesting - that somehow one can figure out the laws of physics from opening their email program just doesnt seem reasonable to me.

&gt;This is exactly what science does. Every hypothesis that you can reliably make accurate predictions with is true on some level. Newtonian physics isn't ""just an interface"" because general relativity explains gravity on a deeper level.

All ideas or theories are an interface of reality if you want to continue to use a metaphor you don't like - but this isn't relevant really because you're not contradicting Don here, and currently, our laws of physics break down when it comes to a unified theory and a model of consciousness - which is the impetus for Don's theory in the first place.

&gt;There's literally zero reasons to think that's impossible. That's how science is done. You don't start from scratch and hope your made up framework just has the rest of science emerge from it. You build a hypothesis based on current observations, make predictions and then test them.

First of all, biological natural selection can only act on genetic variation, but the trait variation we actually see is only partially determined by genetics. Environmental influences have major effects on most traits, including just about all personality traits. So even if every individual had exactly the same underlying genetic determinants of personality, we would still see variation due to the different environments and experiences that shape their behavior.

However, even considering the genetic component, there's no reason to expect that natural selection will lead to a single optimal trait. The trait values (whether for personality or another trait) that lead to the highest fitness often vary through time and space. The physical environment changes, interactions withother organisms change, and interactions with other individuals of your own species change. So what's beneficial here and now may not be beneficial in the context of another time or place. These are all various forms of what's called balancing selection, which is a type of natural selection that favors the maintenance of variation in a population rather than its removal.

Finally, there are other mechanisms of evolution aside from natural selection. Genetic drift may allow sub-optimal trait values to have higher fitness than the most optimal values under certain demographic scenarios, which can lead to a selection-drift balance. Meanwhile, mutation and gene flow can both introduce new variation even in situations where natural selection continuously acts to remove it.

In a ""trait"" as complex as personality, probably all of these factors are present simultaneously.",1578868107

First, as a reply:

&amp;#x200B;

the fact women were more often not hunting could be because they were more often pregnant and/or taking care of children. Still sexist, but it's not like we had office desks and baby formula back then.

&amp;#x200B;

Neanderthals being more fit body-wise... no idea, tbh, as I said, not an expert. I recall reading somewhere that they seemed less adept for speach, making sapiens more organized in hunting and everything else?

Neand were red-headed? That's a first, but if you have a source for that I'd be very curious.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about genetics and species ""fusion"", my rebuttal:

we have fossils from both sapiens and neandertals living in the same times, so we know both species were diferent while living together. But sapiens from back then and modern humans are virtually identical. If sapiens had ""absorved"" neanderthals into their population, you'd expect modern humans to be a tad diferent from pre-merging humans?

So if humans reached 2 million before neanderthals were assimilated, then that would 3.5% of total dna. But it's likely that neanderthals were bigger, faster, stronger, better equipped for cold, and red-headed. So ""ginger-shaming"" goes back hundreds of thousands of years!

t1_fe03ol4,Duardo_e,"Let me know if I ever misunderstand something.

But let's say speciesA gives rise to speciesB, that doesn't mean that now speciesA *has to* go extinct. We have plenty of examples of ""living fossils"" such as the coelacanths which are thought to (propably) be the ancestors of tetrapods (because they have the right traits to and it's fossils fit the evolutionary time-line, they are found before the firsts tetrapod fossils). The list goes on and on. Let's mention the lungfish or even platypuses. 

Now, the example you gave sounds a lot like the evolution of giraffes. In that case it's pretty obvious why they have such long necks. The trees evolve taller in order not to be eaten and at the same time the population of giraffe-like animals develop a longer neck. In that case it's obvious what the _selection pressure_ is pointing towards.
But we gotta keep something in mind: Evolution doesn't have a ""goal"".
Plenty of people belive that transitional species should be seeking towards developing the structures of the animals they are the ancestors of. And that's not true. Animals today are still evolving. Animals now are transitional species and are the ancestors of the animals of the future, and modern animals are just fine living the life they live. There was a time when dinosaurs had feathers but didn't fly. It's not like they were trying to fly, their feathers just filled another purpuse. There was a time when whales had legs. It's not like they were trying to lose their legs, their legs just filled another purpuse.
Dinosaur didn't _need to_ lose body mass and develop longer arms so they could fly. They were fine living their life without flight. It's not like they went extinct because they couldn't fly.
Same with whales. They didn't need to lose their legs or become huge animals. They were already just fine living life with kinda useless legs and being not that big.
So we can't really tell why animals went extinct just by comparing them to their descendants. Maybe it's just that they never went extinct. The same way the 8 year-old version of you didn't die, it just changed.",1578820933
t1_fdzbc8h,Harvestman-man,"There are some examples of taxa placed in old, outdated taxonomic arrangements, but that's not really the issue I have. 

There are many examples of a single obscure genus or species being placed at the base of a larger clade of totally unrelated animals:

* The species *Fasciosminthurus quinquefasciatus* is placed as the sister-taxon to the clade Chelicerata. This is a species of globular springtail, which belong to a totally different subphylum.

* The species *Heteromma fuegiana* is placed as the sister-taxon to all spiders. This is an oudated name for a species of sac spider now known as *Tomopisthes horrendus*. This is not a mistake of being ""outdated"", though (except the name), since this species has always been placed in the infraorder Araneomorphae, with the rest of the sac spiders. The actual basalmost spiders are the Mesothelae, which is not disputed at all.

* The genus *Minua* is placed as the sister-group to all harvestmen. This is an outdated name for a genus of armored harvestman now known as *Minuella*. Again, not a mistake of being ""outdated"", since it has always been placed in the suborder Laniatores, with the rest of the armored harvestmen. The actual basalmost harvestmen are the Cyphophthalmi. 

There seem to be fewer of these random taxa thrown around than last time I checked, so maybe they've fixed some, but I don't see any way of tracking their history of editing the tree.

Even if you ignore these randomly-inserted minor taxa (which you shouldn't, because understanding basal lineages is important for understanding the evolutionary history of the entire clade), there are still problems at the order-level:

* Pycnogonids/Pantopods are placed nested *within* the class Arachnida. While the position of Pygnogonids has been debated, I'm not aware of any studies that recover them as arachnids; they are instead thought to be the sister-group of Euchelicerates (arachinds+horseshoe crabs), or maybe an even earlier-diverging arthropod lineage. 

* Schizomids are placed as the basalmost order of arachnids. All studies (that I'm aware of) have recovered Schizomids as the sister-group to Thelyhonida; as a matter of fact, in the past, these two orders were commonly grouped together as a single order, Uropygi, and this relationship is one of the only rock-solid order-level relationships arachnid taxonomists actually agree on (the placement of many arachnid orders is uncertain), so I don't understand why Onezoom puts them here.

* Harvestmen are placed nested within the clade Anactinotrichida (Opilioacariformes+Parasitiformes). No studies (that I'm aware of) have ever recovered this configuration; although the placement of both harvestmen and Parasitiformes is uncertain, Many taxonomists don't even use the term ""Anactinotrichida"" anymore, and instead just treat Opilioacariformes as an order within Parasitiformes.  

In general, since the placement of many major arachnid groups is not fully resolved, it would be better to use polytomies instead of just randomly clumping together orders which we don't really know where to fit (like Ricinulei and Palpigradi, which are treated as sister-taxa in Onezoom, but certainly aren't).

Regarding harvestman taxonomy:

* The families Phalangodidae and Pyramidopidae are both placed within the superfamily Gonyleptoidea, even though both of these families are totally unrelated to Gonyleptoids, and have *never* been considered to be Gonyleptoids by any taxonomists ever, that I'm aware of. 

* The family Stygnopsidae is placed within the superfamily Epedanoidea, even though it is totally unrelated to Epedanoids; this family has more recently been resolved as a basal lineage of Gonyleptoidea, but as far as I'm aware, has never been grouped with the Epedanoids.

* The Isidiatores are all placed deeply-nested within the infraorder Grassatores, although they're regarded as either the sister-group to Grassatores, or to form a grade of basal lineages preceding the Grassatores.

* Family names like ""Gagrellidae"", ""Leiobunidae"", and ""Monoscutidae"", are used, despite being defunct names no longer used by actual taxonomists. Other (more recent) families, like Acropsopilionidae, Cryptogeobiidae, and Gerdesiidae are absent. You could cite ""outdatedness"" here, and while some of these changes are kinda recent (all of them still at least 5 years old, though), Gagrellidae and Leiobunidae in particular have been treated as subfamilies of Sclerosomatidae since 1992. 

That's a handful of issues, but there are more that I've noticed in harvestmen, and I don't know enough about other arthropod orders to fact-check them, but spiders and mites are certainly rife with similar errors. If you're brave enough to go down to the species-level, nothing makes sense at all (for example, why is *Leiobunum hiasai*, a Japanese species, placed as the sister-species to *Leiobunum apenninicum*, an Italian species, when in fact both of these species belong to different and unrelated formally-named species-groups?); it's obviously totally random, with more of an emphasis on looking pretty than on being correct.

Now, maybe if you look at mammals, it'll be more correct; there's certainly been far more studies done on far fewer species in that group, so it would be much easier to actually get a reliable tree. If you check their ""[data sources](https://www.onezoom.org/data_sources.html)"" tab, they list sources used for several larger groups, but all arthropods (notably- the most diverse lineage of all living organisms) have no ""data source"".

&gt;If you accept evolution is true, then you must accept that the probability you perceive time and space as it truly exists is zero. Since you're not surprised, it probably means you do not comprehend the implications of what that means.

See my comments about his simulation experiment in the other thread. And as opposed to Prof. Hoffman, I'm an actual evolutionary biologist, and I completely reject this claim.

&gt;If you have an issue with his mathematical model of consciousness, then come at it with maths.

I'm sure his math is rock solid. That's not the issue. If a theologist develops perfect mathematical models about how many angels in heaven does it take to change God's lightbulb, that doesn't mean that any of those things exist. He bases those models on the unwarranted assumption that consciousness is everywhere and in everything.",1578803981
t1_fdsh1np,galion1,"&gt;It leads to a very simple logical conclusion; the chances that our perceptions of time and space reflect the actual reality is zero.


This conclusion is in no way simple, nor is it valid in my opinion. He bases this argument on a simulation (detailed here http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FitnessBeatsTruth_apa_PBR) that does pretty poorly to actually simulate anything real.

They basically pit two strategies against each other - looking at the most 'true' representations of the world and then picking the most fit (that maximizes fitness) out of those, versus looking at all possible representations regardless of how true they are and picking the most fit.


If one of your strategies is straight up optimize for fitness, and the other is doing that but with other limitations, of course the one optimizing just for fitness is going to have the highest fitness.


The question is, does this represent anything real? I would say that they haven't done enough to show that. For example, it may very well be impossible to predict the fitness of a behavior without your inner model of reality approximating its true nature, making the fitness-only strategy impossible. This is just one possible way to put a kink in their conclusion.


&gt;Surely you can accept a metaphor? [...]


The problem is that the way he is using the metaphor is flawed and misleading. Let's take his video game example. You would agree that as a character in a simulated world like a video game, you're not peering into the ""true nature of your world"" unless you see the code, basically. However, that doesn't mean that the top level user interface isn't 'true' on some level. You can still see how the physics engine works by observing objects, for example, and you may even be able to write equations describing those top-level phenomena that may come really close to the code itself. You can actually try it yourself, platform games have a pretty rudimentary physics engine that you can try to estimate based on observing and playing the game. You can get pretty close to how the code works.

This is exactly what science does. Every hypothesis that you can reliably make accurate predictions with is true on some level. Newtonian physics isn't ""just an interface"" because general relativity explains gravity on a deeper level.


&gt;[...]he just said the approach for a unified theory FROM the law of physics to account for things like consciousness is impossible, so that is why he offers a bottom-up approach which he believes will show the laws of physics emerging from this deeper reality.


There's literally zero reasons to think that's impossible. That's how science is done. You don't start from scratch and hope your made up framework just has the rest of science emerge from it. You build a hypothesis based on current observations, make predictions and then test them.

t1_fe02lw4,NoahTheAnimator,"&gt; You're asking if there are examples of animals going extinct because they couldn't adappt fast enough?

Well, as I understand evolution, animals don't ""adapt"". They just get lucky. My question, put in more detail, was this:

Suppose there was a species (Let's call them Shlomps) that climbs really high mountains, because in this hypothetical scenario, there are certain types of berries on the tops of the mountains, and those berries are the only thing the Shlomps can eat. However, Shlomps have no feet or hands. Just nubs at the end of their limbs, making climbing VERY difficult. One day, suppose one Shlomp got lucky and through a mutation got hands and feet (I'm not saying this is actually how hands and feet came about, this is just a hypothetical scenario to make a point) and thus it could climb better than the other Shlomps, and thus get the berries all for itself before the other Shlomps could get any. Thus, the Shlomp with hands and feet lives to see another day and pass on it's genes while the Shlomps that don't have hands or feet starve and die off. In this hypothetical example, shouldn't we expect to find lots of Shlomp fossils that are similar to the Shlomp fossils we DO find but without hands or feet? Or in other words, shouldn't we find fossils of extinct species of animals similar to the ones we have today but with some kind of evident reason as to indicate why they would have died off?",1578802275
t3_engh1b,Duardo_e,"So if I understand this. You're asking if there are examples of animals going extinct because they couldn't adappt fast enough? If that's the thing then that's a tricky question. Because environments are always changing. Maybe because of the presence of a predator, or a prey, or even some wild things as the composition of gases in the atmosphere. There are way too many things that could change the conditions in which creatures live. Because of this, creatures will always be changing along side their environments. So the question is, how many changes will a (e.g.) theropod go through before we call it a different species? Maybe it happens that this group (of the species of theropod) never died, they never went to 0 population. It's just that now they are so different now that we call them something else. And that's exactly what happend. In a sense, dinosaurs never went extinct, they just _changed_.

Now, many comments say that the answer is ""yes, 99% of all the creatures that have ever lived are now extinct"". And that's also true. Just pick any example of an extinct creature and there you go, that creature belonged to a population of animals that, when their environment changed, didn't have the right adaptations to survive. When dinosaurs ""went extinct"" being small, hiding underground, storing food, needing very small amounts of food to survive, were all traits that were selected for. When that happened, being big, having to hunt for food or eating 10 tons of plants a day, were all traits not useful for survival anymore.",1578801508

It could be that the two gen codes are too different now. It could be that there's a mountain between the two groups and that's stopping them from breeding. It could be that the females from one group, find the males from the other group disgusting but if they were inseminated in a lab, the female would get pregnant. So sometimes 2 different species are capable of breeding but just don't do it) we literality fucked them into extinction. Thus, now some of our DNA is neanderthal dna.

It's worth keeping in mind that the odds of any given organism actually being fossilized are astronomical. With the exception of certain species that live in conditions that are highly conducive to fossilization, it takes some pretty unusual circumstances for an organism to be fossilized. 

This sounds preposterous until you really stop and think about it. First, think about how hard it is too actually find a fossil. In some places they are common, but may people will go their whole lives without actually finding one or seeing one in nature. And that is the fossils of every animal that ever lived. 

Then, just think of all the plants and animals that are alive today. Today's number isn't special, but it is a *reasonable* approximation of the number that existed at any other time. It doesn't take any complicated reasoning to grasp that being fossilized when you die is a seriously unusual event. Literally the odds are billions to one against for most species.

I cringe every time I hear a creationist mention “kind” because it means they haven’t the slightest concept of species in the genetic sense. I’m no biologist, but I do trust in the decades of research, evidence, and peer review that has gone into forming a working theory of evolution. 

But even confronted with the best incontrovertible evidence, this guy will only dig in further to his beliefs.",1578723415
t3_en2hoa,river-wind,"Your question is both on the right track (any isolated population of living organism will slowly diverge from other related populations due to genetic drift), and off-base in some others (a scientific theory is a rigorously rested and well-established idea about the mechanisms of natural process - saying “just a theory” isn’t correct.  This use of “scientific theory” is different than the common usage of the word theory, and it creates confusion).

I’m going to start at the answer and work backwards: they are modern humans, and there would likely be no problem with someone from outside the group and a Sentinelese mating successfully.

I can say both of these things with confidence because there have been many stone-age peoples re-encountered around the world over the past few hundred years by exploring cultures, and there have been no issues with producing offspring between any of them.  Even more so, genetic evidence shows that Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthals mated, and they were much more distantly related than any humans alive today, with anywhere from 100 thousand to 750 thousand years from their last common ancestor to when Neanderthals died out.  With Homo sapiens becoming a species between 160 and 300 thousand years ago, 60,000 years would be a significant amount of time, but still within the time frame of modern humans.

I say they are modern humans because even without a DNA sample, there doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they are not Homo sapiens sapiens.  Their language, housing, canoes, weapons all suggest they are modern humans.  They may not be living a modern lifestyle, but neither are the Amish in America.  And like the Amish, they are biologically modern humans living a chosen cultural isolation; even if they differ genetically somewhat from other humans living today due to that isolation.  They are almost certainly not even close to being as genetically distant as Neanderthals.

But you are correct that isolation is an important part of speciation.  Groups separated long enough will eventually diverge.  That separation can be due to a population living in an island.  BUT, they would likely need to not have things like canoes to ensure that they were truly isolated.  They, and the nearby Nicobarese and Onge GOT to those islands by boat.  Other humans managed to sail from Southeast Asia to New Zealand, Easter Island, Hawaii, some from northern Japan appear to have even made it to North America some 20,000 years ago; to think that the Sentinelese got to their island and then never encountered another human group for 60,000 years seems very unlikely.  A DNA sample would likely be able to verify that.

I keep bringing up DNA samples because of the idea of a molecular clock.  In every human’s body there are new mutations unique to you.  If any of those mutations are in your gamete cells, you can pass that mutation on to offspring, and it may spread to more offspring and become a common mutation in your village in time.  We know how regularly mutations happen, so we can look at a person’s DNA (nuclear DNA, which mixes between male and female during reproduction, and mitochondrial DNA which comes from the mother only) and tell roughly how distantly related they are to someone else by looking at what mutations and how many mutations the two people share.  Compare enough people’s DNA and you can work out a map of when populations diverged.  If we got a DNA sample from a Sentinelese person, we could pretty definitively tell how long they have been isolated, and maybe even get an idea of when the most recent contact events occurred (assuming they resulted in offspring).   Give them another 100,000 years of isolation, and we can check for speciation again.

# Fossil Reveals Earth’s Oldest Known Animal Guts

*The find in a Nevada desert revealed an intestine inside a creature that looks like a worm made of a stack of ice cream cones.*

They say you should trust your gut, which is what Emmy Smith did when she went hunting for fossils in 2016. Dr. Smith, a field geologist, had a hunch she would find something interesting at a site north of Pahrump, Nev., and she did. But what her gut hadn’t told her was that some of those fossils would turn out to contain the oldest known animal guts on the planet.

“It was just really lucky,” said Dr. Smith, who works at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and is part of the team that reported the find on Friday in Nature Communications.

The guts are those of an extinct animal called Cloudina, which looked like a worm made of a stack of ice cream cones and lived about 550 million years ago, just after a period in Earth’s history when the entire planet was encased in ice.

Dr. Smith and a doctoral student in her lab wrapped the Cloudina fossils they found in toilet paper, put them in paint buckets and hauled them back to their field car, a Ford Ranger nicknamed Kitty. Later, Dr. Smith shipped the fossils to Tara Selly and James Schiffbauer, paleontologists at the University of Missouri, for further study.

Dr. Schiffbauer and Dr. Selly specialize in the group of fossils that Cloudina is a member of, the Ediacara biota. The group includes Earth’s oldest known animals, which means that if a researcher wants to figure out what the dawn of the animal kingdom looked like — and find out when animals developed intestines — studying animal fossils like Cloudina is a good place to start.

In their lab, the duo shined X-rays on Cloudina’s remains, building 3-D images of the fossils’ insides. “The first one we were looking at, we found a gut,” said Dr. Selly, who spotted the digestive system in the lab while Dr. Schiffbauer was in his office.

“She texted me and said, ‘Hey, found something really cool, you have to come look at this,’” Dr. Schiffbauer said. When he got to the lab and saw the X-ray images, he knew exactly what they had on their hands.

“This is a gut,” he recalled saying.

The tubular guts are only about as wide as a cocktail straw. They run through Cloudina’s entire length, meaning they passed all the way through from the front end to the back end. Not every animal has a digestive system that ends in a different place from where it begins. But that setup has been common in everything from humans to insects to dinosaurs. Cloudina’s guts, then, are the first known example of our particular kind of digestive tract in the history of animal life.

“Finding that we had a tubular structure inside this skeletal tube tells us that it had a distinct mouth and a distinct anus,” Dr. Schiffbauer said. In other animals like corals, the gut is a simple sac, and the only way into that sac is through the mouth, which also serves as the anus. But with the evolution of a through-going gut, animals no longer had to wait for their food to digest before regurgitating the waste so they could keep eating.

This made eating a lot more efficient, and it opened the door for other kinds of animals with through-going guts to evolve later on, said Lidya Tarhan, a paleontologist at Yale University who was not involved in the new research.

“I think this gets at the heart of some of the most outstanding questions about the evolution of complex life on our planet,” she said.",1578710292

t1_fbu0v9f,aikiwiki,"&gt; His argument from evolution can't really go anywhere. 

It leads to a very simple logical conclusion; the chances that our perceptions of time and space reflect the actual reality is zero.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;All you can say that goes in line with his simulation experiment is that we evolved not to take in all available information. 

It leads to a very simple logical conclusion; the chances that our perceptions of time and space reflect the actual reality is zero.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That's almost trivial. 

All points of reference do not reflect the deeper causal reality, that is far from trivial if you're seeking a unified theory and a scientific model of consciousness.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But he states that observation as 'the reality we experience is just an interface from some ultimate base reality', which is somewhat of a deepity (trivial to the extent that is true, and at the very least baseless to the extent that it is profound). 

Surely you can accept a metaphor? He says it is like an interface, and only in the sense that an interface does not show you the truth, it shows you what you need to get the job done. That's it. that is where the metaphor ends.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The observation that sensory input and common sense don't necessarily lead us to the ""true nature of reality"" is fine. Anything you add to your model of the world based on that is pulled right out of your ass. 

Can you make your point here a bit more coherent?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Just as you can't say reality is what it seems, you also can't say it's not what it seems, and the fact that we're not receiving all available information doesn't invalidate the information we do receive, or hint at some deeper level of information.

He never said it ""invalidates"" the laws of physics, he just said the approach for a unified theory FROM the law of physics to account for things like consciousness is impossible, so that is why he offers a bottom-up approach which he believes will show the laws of physics emerging from this deeper reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is all before we get to consciousness, which is even more ridiculous. He might as well be describing the mathematical models he developed for how many angels need to hold us to the ground for gravity to work.

t1_fdnxsn1,ducbo,"Penguins are pretty anatomically singular though. They have essentially reorganized their body such that multiple bones in the hands and tail are fused far beyond most other birds, they have extremely dense “diving” bones to assist with buoyancy,  their shoulder blades (scapulars) become absolutely massive and downturned, to support the muscle attachment required for a powerful upstroke. In contrast, most air-flying birds rely entirely on the downstroke for their flight; as a result, they have a huge “keel” (chest area) for downstroke muscled to attach to. Penguins also can pocket air inside their feathers, and they have muscles that control each feather, so when they “jump” out of the water they can actively expel air from beneath their feathers, resulting in a jet-like propulsion - if you’ve ever seen any David Attenborough docs about penguins you’ll know exactly what I mean. Further, they have these fishlike torpedo shaped bodies. essentially they have been reorganized for “aquatic flight” as opposed to flight in air.

t3_em6ptj,Denisova,"The overall answer to your question is: mutations. There are different kinds of mutations: substitutions (C**A**TG &gt; C**C**TG) deletions (CAT**G** &gt; CAT), insertions (CATG &gt; CA**A**TG), frame shifts (AAC**CATGGAT**CAG &gt; AACA**CATG**GAT), inversions (CATG &gt; GRAC), translocation (**CA**TGGTAC &gt; TGGTAC**CA**) and duplication (CATG &gt; CATGCATG).

These may involve just one mucleotide altered but often whole chunks of DNA may be affected in one single mutation instance, even entire genes or complete chromosomes.

But it's best understood when using an analogy: language.

Here you have a sentence: ""I like sweats most day"".

Deletion: ""I like sweat most day"".

Insertion: ""I like sweats most days"".

Substitution: ""I love sweats most day"".

Frame shift: ""I do love sweats most day"" (frame shifts often occur due to an insertion or deletion, the insertion of ""do "" shifted the phrase ""sweats most day"" three positions to the right.

Inversion: ""I like stew most day"", the inversion was accompanied by 2 deletions.

Translocation: ""Most day I like sweats"".

Duplication: ""I love sweats most most day"".

As you see, every sentence still makes sense. Everytime the mutation changed the meaning and import of the sentence a bit.

Of course in genetics this still would spell problems: you can't just change a functional part of the DNA, let's say a gene - because the original protein (genes code for proteins) will not be produces anymore.

But let's assume a complete duplication occurred of the whole sentence: ""I love sweats most day I love sweats most day"". One of the copies may be altered now at random because the other one still is doing the proper job and the original protein is still produced.

The former copy now functions as a kind of experimental playground. So I applied some mutations in successive instances:

""I love sweat**ing** **I** m**u**st **s**ay"".

The meaning of the sentence now changed completely. Something new emerged. and it only needed the ""s"" of *sweats* to be deleted and the sequence ""ing"" to be inserted, an insertion of ""I"", a substitution of the ""o"" of *most* with a ""u"" and a substitution of the ""s"" of *say* with a ""d"".

The experimental playground also might be a random sequence within the non-functional sections of the DNA. As they are non-functional, no crucial function is affected.

Also we might have chunks of functional DNA from other sources entering an organism, introducing brand new traits. This is called horizontal gene transfer.

However, I see their greatest hurdle in developing a fully aquatic lifestyle is not necessarily the laying and incubation of the egg.  It's the aquatic ability, or lack thereof, of the penguin chick.

For other terrestrial species returned to the sea, like whales, dolphins, sea snakes, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, even some that have not made the full transition like saltwater crocodiles, sea turtles,  monitors, even seals, sea lions or sea otters, the young are potentially capable of swimming and surviving in the water right from the moment of birth/hatching.

However penguins rely on the waterproofing of their feathers through grooming and the oils they produce.  Young penguins don't even produce the right kind of feathers to be able to waterproof until their first moult.  Until then they're just fluffballs that would turn into sodden, sinking and quickly drowned hatchlings even if their mother did develop the ability for live birth.

So there are some major developments, including possibly losing their feathers that would be required before penguins could become truly fully aquatic.",1578600604

t1_fdmrabi,TheBlackCat13,"&gt; Sensing light was the example I gave earlier, but all the other senses seem like completely new material as well.

They actually aren't.  They are all very slightly modified versions of things already extremely common even in single-celled organisms.

Sensing light is actually something very easy to get accidentally.  Cells are full of chemical receptor proteins, proteins that activate in the presence of a particular chemical.  There are massive families of these that activate in response to different chemicals, and only slight changes are needed to change what chemical they respond to.  

Now imagine one of these responds to a chemical that, by chance, slightly changes its shape when exposed to light.  It is pretty much inevitable that some will do this since it is pretty common for organic molecules to do this.  This will slightly change the chance of that molecule binding (or unbinding), and thus that receptor activating (or deactivating), when light is presence.  And that slight light sensitivity is all that is needed for evolution to take over.  Over time mutations and natural selection will lead to molecules that are more and more likely to change shape in response to light, but the actual receptor mechanism will remain the same.

If we actually look at light sensitivity, even in humans, this is exactly how it works.  The most common family of chemical sensing proteins is the absolutely enormous GPCR family.  And the actual proteins responsible for our light sensitivity are a few closely-related GPCR proteins that bind to a molecule that changes its shape in response to light (it actually *unbinds* in response to light, meaning the receptors *turn off* when light is present).

Smell works and some of taste in the same way, with GPCR proteins on the surface of the cell sensitive to different molecules.

Touch, hearing, balance, joint position, heat, cold, pain, and some of taste all work based on a family of proteins called TRP proteins, which allow electric current (ions) to flow through a cell based on particular stimuli.  Like with GPRCs, the vast majority are *not* involved in senses at all, and those that are are very closely related to those that aren't.  Touch, hearing, balance, joint position, and some of pain are based on ones that open when mechanically stretched. Others open in response to particular ranges of chemicals.  Others open in response to GPCR proteins.  All are very similar in their structure, and all are easy to get accidentally.  

So none of this is at all new, just co-opted from existing functions.",1578580736
t1_fdmp0zq,Lennvor,"You're confusing terms; the ""evolution"" you describe is actually called ""development"". You claim later on that development is the body ""evolving in a way"". Sure, ""in a way""; ""evolution"" is a word that means many different things, all based on the concept of ""change"". And there are plenty of kinds of change that aren't called ""evolution"". For example, the change in a star over its lifetime or a Pokémon as it passes certain level thresholds are called ""Stellar evolution"" and ""Pokémon evolution"", but those two things have nothing in common beyond involving ""change"". On the other hand, the process of insects changing form through their lifecycle is fairly similar to Pokémon evolution (insofar as the latter is based on it!) but it's called ""metamorphosis"". In RPG characters increasing a level (like Pokémon) it's called ""leveling"". When DNA changes it's called ""mutating"". You can't just swap those words around and hope to make sense.

The process of biological evolution is a very specific one, that is NOT the same as the process of development of an organism.

t1_fdmqhpb,TheBlackCat13,"You are assuming all that complexity is actually important for the gene's function.  It isn't.  The genes we are talking about code for proteins which are the actual functional part.  That are made up of building blocks called amino acids, on average about 1,000.  Of these, the number directly involved in the protein's function is typically just **2-3**, and just 1 is enough to confer a weak function.  So a single change in a single DNA nucleotide is enough to give a gene an entire new function.

A small minority of the remaining amino acids are involved in getting those 2-3 in roughly the right relative positions and orientations, but can take on an enormous variety of structures and still do that.  The rest is just filler, or involved in other functions.

Further, the majority of new genes don't appear randomly.  If you change one of those keys amino acids, or change their relative positions somewhat, you often don't just end up with a broken protein, you end up with a working protein that does something different.  So most new genes are based on small changes, even just 1, on an existing gene.",1578579089
t1_fdmqhpb,cubist137,"Living things reproduce themselves.

This is pretty obvious, but it's worth noting right off the bat. And *because* living things reproduce themselves, there's pretty much *always* going to be a whole lot more than just *one* living thing. As an example: The last time I checked, there's something like *10^(30)* bacteria on Earth.

So, for any particular sort of mutation you might be interested in, there's a *hell of a lot* of different opportunities for that mutation to occur. Suppose some particular Mutation X is a 1-in-a-trillion long shot: 1-in-a-trillion is 1 out of 10^(12)—which means that just by sheer chance alone, we should expect there to be something like (10^(30) / 10^(12) =) ***10^(18)*** bacteria which *have* that Mutation X.

Now, a mutation doesn't care how it will affect the critters which end up having it. I mean, how *could* a mutation care about that? A mutation is, after all, the result of a chemical reaction, one that operates in strict accordance with the laws of chemistry and physics. Maybe a mutation will end up helping the critter live and thrive and reproduce itself; maybe the mutation will end up *hindering* the critter's ability to live and thrive and reproduce; maybe the mutation won't really affect the critter much, it at all.

So, to repeat myself, mutations occur *without regard to how they'll affect the critters which have them*. But once a critter *does* have some particular Mutation X, that critter *will* have to live with whatever effects Mutation X has on it. This is where ""beneficial"" and ""deleterious"" come into the picture. We say that a mutation is ""beneficial"" to the critter if it *helps* that critter to live and thrive and reproduce; we say that a mutation is ""deleterious"" if it *hinders* the critter from doing that stuff.

Those mutations which are beneficial, *by definition*, end up *helping* the critters which have them to reproduce. Which means that beneficial mutations tend to spread throughout a breeding population. I say ""tend to"", cuz it's always possible that a critter with the most beneficial mutation imaginable could end up dead through sheer bad luck—maybe they got caught in a lava flow or something. But bad luck applies to *every* critter, you know? So the expectation is, any beneficial mutation will prolly spread throughout the breeding population in which that mutation appeared.

Does any of the above make sense to you?",1578578579
t1_fdn13ty,Lennvor,"Oh I'd misunderstood your question! I expect it's a matter of sources and sinks. So you seem to expect that insofar as one CO2 molecules = 1 O2 molecule in the process of photosynthesis, in order for plants to generate a 20% oxygen atmosphere they'd require as much CO2, i.e. 20%. But that's not necessarily the case; for one thing you might have noticed we went from individual molecules, to percentages, which are not the same thing. It's not the case that all of the oxygen in the atmosphere, the whole 20% of it, was generated from plants this year and thus would have required the equivalent amount of CO2 to be in the atmosphere that same year so it could be made. As you point out there's like 1% CO2 in the atmosphere at any given point, so that's the total amount of CO2 plants have to work from on a given day, and that's how much O2 they create. The difference in percentages must come from the fact that photosynthesis absorbs CO2 faster than respiration absorbs O2. Meaning that a certain proportion of the oxygen produced by plants tends to hang around and thus the percentage builds up over time, while conversely the percentage of CO2 stays low because photosynthesis fixes it more or less as fast as it gets released into the atmosphere (unless it gets released at very very high rates all of a sudden, wink wink sob).",1578576739

t3_em6ptj,intigheten,"&gt; If you didn’t have a way to smell something, how would you know that you needed to smell something? 

Natural selection doesn't work like this at all. You can rest easy knowing that what you described is just as ludicrous as it sounds. Adaptation actually occurs without the willful participation of individuals. In fact, it does not occur in individuals at all, whose genomes are relatively fixed. There's also a misconception that evolution is the result of random changes to the genome. This alone producing stable complexity is also ludicrous; random variation in the genome is only half the story.

What you need for natural selection to result in evolution is two things: \*random variation\* among a population of individuals, and \*non-random selection\*. It's the non-random selection that is the mechanism that drives evolution in certain directions (like better and better eyes, noses, and ears or longer and longer necks).

Think about it like this: Take ten strips of paper, all of different lengths. Then, take the longest one and throw it away. Next, choose one at random, remove it, and replace it with one strip that is slightly shorter and one strip that is slight taller. You now have ten strips again. If you repeat this process, the average length of the ten strips will get smaller and smaller over time. This is called \*negative selection\* and describes the situation where a trait shifts in a population because of increased predation or mortality - like a prey species becoming smaller to escape predators.

It also works like this: Take ten strips of paper. Then remove one at random. Next, find the shortest strip and add a copy of that strip. Likewise to the first process, the average length of the ten strips will get smaller even though you are removing them at random. This is because you're giving a ""reproductive advantage"" to the shortest strip. This is positive selection, where a trait shifts because of a specific advantage it confers which allows the individuals who carry it to produce more offspring.

I hope you can begin to understand that this process is inherently algorithmic and will occur in any system where there is random variation under non-random selection. So again, it is not the individual which determines that it might benefit from a better sense of smell, but random drift in that trait which confers a distinctive advantage, which then increases in frequency in the population as a result of the non-random selection.",1578576220

t1_fdmrabi,galion1,"Let me try to explain this with an analogy.

Imagine you have a factory that makes screwdrivers. Like with DNA coding for proteins, the factory has blueprints (this is an analogy, DNA is very different from an actual blueprint). Every so often people copy the blueprints and some of them make mistakes.
It's possible to make a mistake and end up with a new kind of screwdriver. Say there was a blueprints that said to make a one-lined edge. If somebody accidentally copies that as 2 lines, you end up with a Phillips screwdriver.
it's also possible to make a mistake and end up with an entirely different kind of tool. If somebody makes a mistake of writing that the handle should be much wider than in the original blueprint, you could end up with some sort of rudimentary hammer.

This is a crude example of how evolution works on the molecular level with proteins. Proteins can end up doing very different functions by changing key parts. A lot of ""evolving"" has happened by DNA duplicating, and the new copy slowly changing to do something completely different than the original.",1578572345
t3_em6ptj,mohelgamal,"The scope of this question is really broad but there is a few different things you should learn that would help you understand how small mutations can cause big and new features to develop .


1) one thing to know is  protein folding, as you may know DNA is translated to protein sequences, but that is not the end of the story, most large will fold based on their exact sequence in a shape that allows them to do what they need to do. A single point mutation can cause the protein to fold differently, sometime the difference is big, sometimes it is really small, but on the whole a single point mutation can result in a completely new function or type of hormone arising. 

2) some proteins has to link up with one to work right. And the links are dependent on the folding and exact sequence. For example, different types of collagen that makes different types of tissues in your body are only different in just how many repeating sequences get to tether to one another to form variable length strands and how many attachment points occur between the strands. This is how you get skin, tendons, bone, and eyes from what is basically is the same protein but just with very minor differences in the actual protein sequence

3) cell receptors for different hormones consist of usually two subunits, one subunit binds time the hormones, and the other actually activate a certain effect inside the cell, the link between the subunits are not very complicated. They are usually manufactured independently and sometimes the same hormonal binding subunit connect to different effectors inside even in the same person but with different statistical variability. That is why a hormone can have many different effects on different cells, or several hormones can cause the same effect on some cell. All that gives an appearance of complixity but if you know the details you would see how simple it is 

4) genes, especially the essential genes for life, consist of many copies of the same sequence repeating over and over. When DNA is replicated you get a relatively rough copy rather than an exact one.  So you don’t have one copy of the sequence for hemoglobin, you get a bunch and all you need to live is to get enough of a working kind to live. Now imagine you have a gene that code for height that has 10 copies of the same sequence, you get a single mutation in one that makes you taller, you would have 9 regular and only 1 mutated. You would look almost exactly the same as the rest of your species, but as you breed with others who had the same mutation, you start getting individuals that have 2 copies, if this gene makes you more like to survive and breed (natural selection) the mutations will start to accumulate in subsequent generations, and you won’t start seeing its real effect until you reach a level where individuals are being born with 7 or 8 copies. So mutations aren’t just a one off event and PAM you have a new species, it is a slow process of the same mutation happening over and over and accumulating causing a gradual difference to emerge over time. If the process runs for a few million years with different mutations accumulating the same species would split into several descendant species that looks nothing alike. Especially if that mutation causes other mutations to be favored. Also as individuals breed, off spring with accumulated beneficial mutations from both parents would be more successful into making into a new descendant species over a long period of time",1578571532

t1_fdla7od,Lennvor,"I know banded iron formations are an important part of that, in that the pre-oxygen Earth had plenty of reduced iron lying around begging to be oxidized, and all the oxygen that got produced at first was captured that way, so the oxygen content of the atmosphere didn't increase. Given how reactive oxygen is it makes sense it would only deign hang around in large percentages in the atmosphere only if there is literally nothing left on Earth to oxidize.

But this must not be the only process at play because oxygen seems to remain at low levels far after the text says banded iron formations no longer get created.",1578566989
t3_em6ptj,Lennvor,"Beyond what other people have said about how this can work in principle, people who investigate the genome can actually \*track\* how a lot of genetic material developed. Just like organisms fall in families within families within families in a way that points to common ancestry, it turns out many genes fall into ""gene families"" the same way, indicating that the genes within those families developed from gene duplications and then modifications in the duplicated genes. There are also cases of ""de novo"" genes found, where some species have active genes where all of their relatives have junk DNA, and analysis of the sequences show that the genes developed from previously-nonfunctional DNA that became functional. There are also times when whole chromosomes or even genomes are duplicated. This happens mostly in plants (where it can lead to more vigorous individuals, so it's not a neutral or always-detrimental change) but also in certain animals, and IIRC there is reason to think a few of those events happened in our own lineage (going back to early animals I mean, I don't think mammals do well with whole-genome duplications).

t1_fdmnyg0,Lennvor,"There could be, but I don't see much reason to think there's a systematic one. Other than what another commenter mentioned, that unattractive people will put more effort into their other positive traits to compensate, but that's got nothing to do with evolution.

Tradeoffs can happen for certain reasons. First, a trait could be expensive; it might require resources or energy to use and maintain. So not having that trait, or having less of it, would automatically mean you can divert resources or energy to other things. Second, a trait could happen to be linked to other traits, as an inevitable physical property or an accident of the genes involved, and that could lead to a tradeoff if improving one trait means worsening the other (like in dogs where cute curly tails are associated with spine issues). Third, a trait could be advantageous or not depending on the environment, but I don't think this applies as much to ""attractiveness"" because attractiveness is basically defined as being an advantage. However a tradeoff that does apply to attractiveness is Fourth, sexual selection could drive the evolution of traits that are negative for other purposes (such as survival), and so a tradeoff gets baked in there. Typical example is the peacock's tail.

But none of those factors play an obvious role in the case of human attractiveness. Physical attractiveness in humans doesn't involve any obviously expensive features, it's mostly about having a certain shape. The most we have in terms of ""extra structure"" would be long hair and large breasts, but those aren't universal markers of attractiveness to begin with, and they don't involve that much extra tissue or metabolic load. When you compare to the metabolic cost of physical fitness, fine motor skills, cognitive or emotional competence I'm pretty sure physical attractiveness is negligible (I mean, it does take individual humans energy to make themselves \*look\* attractive, but that's not as much of an evolutionary thing). And anyway, modern humans aren't resource-limited such that it would matter. Nor is there an obvious physical tradeoff. There could certainly be genetic tradeoffs but I don't know of any specific one where this or that aspect of attractiveness happens to be genetically linked to this or that random disadvantage. As for runaway sexual selection driving traits that are negative to survival, the main ones I can see are long hair, beards and large breasts in women but again, they don't strike me as that much of a problem for survival, especially given how human societies (going back to prehistory) involve cooperation that can help mitigate many physical disadvantages.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one potential tradeoff I haven't mentioned because I haven't quite gotten my mind around how it impacts this question. Basically I think we can say there's a kind of conservation of complexity in evolution - you can't optimize equally for everything, and so if you optimize very hard for one thing, other traits must fall by the wayside. And so by that argument, even if putting all bits of a human in the exact shape to make them attractive doesn't have a high energy cost per se, it does have a high entropy cost, and that induces a tradeoff. The thing is, if I'm even right about this, it's kind of a statistical phenomenon and I don't know how it applies to your question. And I don't know that it's the case that statistically, attractiveness is correlated with lower scores on other traits (for one thing, all the things I said about gene linkages or physical properties that induce a tradeoff, could also do the opposite). If we have four hundred people that can be intelligent or attractive and those traits are randomly distributed, we might expect two hundred to be intelligent or attractive but not both, a hundred to be both intelligent and attractive and a hundred to be neither... That might look like a tradeoff because people that are intelligent and attractive are less numerous than those that are only one of those, but it actually isn't, it's just random distribution, and if you know someone is attractive it tells you nothing about their intelligence. In other words, if someone is unattractive they \*can\* have other positive traits (so their disadvantage isn't universal), and given the number of traits a human can have they statistically \*must\* have plenty of other positive traits, but there isn't a specific process that makes ""unattractive"" lead to ""other positive traits"".",1578565752

Being able to sense light and chemicals in the environment (which is all smell is) did not evolve from nothing in already existing multicellular organisms. They evolved because all cells in those organisms already had *some* sensitivity to light or smells, and part of what makes a multicellular organism successful is the fact that some cells can specialize. So some cells started getting better and better at sensing light or smell, while getting worse at some other things most likely, but provided a benefit to the organism as a whole.

This is easily explained if our ancient ancestors laid eggs. 

If you are a creationist, I have a couple of questions for you - what is your explanation for the human embryonic yolk sac?

If you have an explanation for it, is it a BETTER explanation than common descent?

The yolk sac is non-functional as it does not provide nutrition for us as embryos.

This is building off of some recent discussions related to “genetic entropy”. Before we get too far, some terms need defining, so we’re all on the same page. 

*Some* creationists might disagree with some of these definitions. Tough luck. These are the biological definitions, not the creationist versions. 

Mutation: Any change to the base sequence of a DNA molecule.

Neutral: Does not affect fitness.

Deleterious: Hurts fitness

Beneficial: Helps fitness

Fitness: Reproductive success.

Got it? Great. Let’s do this.

&amp;nbsp;

**Section 1. Equilibrium**

The first thing we need to cover is perhaps a bit counterintuitive, but extremely important: There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur. 

There are two main reasons for this.

The first is very simple: Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations. Consider a single base, which can exist in state a or a’, where a’ represents a mutation. Once that mutation occurs, a --&gt; a’ is no longer possible, but a’ --&gt; a has become possible. If there is a fitness effect to the original mutation (i.e. it is not neutral), its occurrence changes the distribution of fitness effects going forward. 

So why does this matter? Consider a larger but still extremely oversimplified scenario. Ten bases. Each one has three potential mutations (because there are four possible bases at each site, and each site can only be one at a time). Let’s say for each of these ten sites, one of the possible mutations is beneficial, and the other two are equally deleterious, and all are equally likely. 

So at the start, the ratio of possible beneficial mutations to deleterious is 1:2, and assuming they’re all equally likely, we’d expect deleterious mutations to occur at about twice the rate as beneficial. Right?

Wrong.

Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we *also* remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s *2* beneficial and 1 *neutral*. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.

after 2: 12/2/16.

after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)

One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial. 

Now, that’s pretty unrealistic; beneficial mutations are quite rare. 

So let’s remove them. Now consider each site with 1 neutral and 2 deleterious mutations possible.

After 1 mutation, we go from 0/10/20 to 2/10/18 (because the original neutral mutation became beneficial relative to the new genotype, the deleterious mutation that occurred is off the table, the other becomes neutral, relative to the one that occurred, and the back mutation is beneficial.)

So keep that going:

2 mutations: 4/10/16

3 mutations: 6/10/14. Majority not deleterious. 

At 5 mutations, it becomes 10/10/10. 

[Figure 1.]( https://i.imgur.com/3TMbDY6.png
)

First two scenarios graphed. X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is number of possible mutations. Red line is deleterious mutations, blue is beneficial in first scenario, green is beneficial in second. 

&amp;nbsp;

You can play with these number however you want. Genome size, percentage of bases that are selectable, frequency of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious. As long as you permit neutral mutations, you’ll always hit an equilibrium point at some number of deleterious mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

In fact, let’s model that more specifically. 

Let’s say, what, 99% of mutations are deleterious, and only 0.1% are beneficial. And also that there is zero selection. Is that sufficiently pessimistic for creationists? And let’s work with 1000 sites.

So the expected ratio at the start, in percentages, would be 0.1/0.9/99 b/n/d. 

But as deleterious mutations accumulate, the ratio changes, just like the simple examples above. Where’s the crossover point? About 330 deleterious mutations. That’s where beneficial become more likely. 

[Figure 2.]( https://i.imgur.com/hMShpg9.png
)

X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is frequency of mutations. Red line is deleterious, blue is beneficial. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, these are of course not linear relationships. The probably changes with each mutation, not just at the crossover point where beneficial becomes more likely. So as each mutation occurs, the downward slop of deleterious mutations (i.e. the rate at which that occur) decreases, while the upward slope of beneficial mutations also decreases. The result is that they asymptotically approach the equilibrium point, resulting in a genome that is at dynamic equilibrium between beneficial and harmful mutations. 

And *that*, my friends, is the first reason why harmful mutations cannot accumulate at a constant rate over time. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact. Say you have two sites: J and K, and they can be J (normal) or j (mutation). It can be the case that j and k, each on their own, are deleterious, but together are beneficial. So just considering these two sites, you start off with two possible deleterious mutations and zero possible beneficial mutations. But if J --&gt; j occurs, now you have two possible beneficial mutations (j back to J, or K to k), and zero possible deleterious mutations. This type of thing is well known – it’s part of the [lobster trap model]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01223.x
) of why we can’t get rid of antibiotic resistance.

In the above examples, we’re not considering epistasis, but it would also be occurring. So with each harmful mutation that occurs, not only are you changing the frequencies as described above, you’re *also* turning previously deleterious mutations into beneficial mutations. So in addition to making extremely unrealistic assumptions with regard to the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations, *and* completely omitting selection, we’re *also* leaving out this additional factor that facilitates reaching this equilibrium point faster. 

&amp;nbsp;

So put these two things together, and I hope everyone reading can see why we can’t assign absolute fitness values to specific mutations, how the occurrence of one mutation can cause the fitness effects of other mutations to change, and how that inevitably leads to an equilibrium where beneficial and deleterious mutations occur at the same rate. And why all that means you can’t, as Sanford et al. want to do, allow deleterious mutations to accumulate at a constant rate, even without selection. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 2. Mutation-Selection Balance**

That’s all well and good, but all of that stuff only deals with mutations. We need to talk about the other side of the ledger: Selection.

Adding selection introduces a new concept: Mutation-selection balance. Though I hope it is clear, the point of this section will be to explain how and why, once we add selection to the equation, the equilibrium we found above shifts away from deleterious mutations (because they are selected out of the population).

In order for this to happen, the strength of selection must be high enough for the selection to operate. The strength of selection is more technically called the *selection differential*, the fitness difference between individuals with a specific mutation and the average population fitness. If the difference is large enough, that mutation can be selected for or against (depending on the sign of the differential). 

The rate at which mutations are selected out is based on the rate at which they occur and the selection differential. 

Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated. I don’t know where this threshold is supposed to be, and I don’t think creationists know either, but the fact that it must exist (because if it doesn’t, then creationists are in effect arguing that deleterious mutations can accumulate in a linear fashion without affecting fitness, which is the opposite of what Sanford claims wrt “genetic entropy”) means that *at some point* as mutations occur, selection against deleterious mutations *will* begin to occur. This will slow the rate at which deleterious mutations accumulate, ultimately resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between mutations occurring and being selected out.

&amp;nbsp;

Considering this in the context of what we modeled above, we have two options for what can occur:

1) The selection threshold (the number of mutations that must occur for selection to kick in) is beyond the equilibrium point. In this scenario, the genome in question settles at the equilibrium described above, without selection affecting the number of deleterious mutations. 

or

2) The selection threshold is *before* the “no selection” equilibrium, in which case the genome in question settles at a *different* equilibrium, one with *fewer* deleterious mutations that expected based on the above models. 

Under either case, you still arrive at an equilibrium at which deleterious mutations stop accumulating. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 3. Why this matters for “genetic entropy”**

Now, with all that in mind, I’m going to provide a mechanistic description of how “genetic entropy” supposedly works. I’m going to use Sanford’s (and other creationists’) language here, even though they use several terms incorrectly. 

According to Sanford, the process works like this: Most mutations are deleterious, but the effects are so small they have no effect on reproductive output. But they are still harmful to the fitness (health, function, etc.) of the organism. Over time, as these unselectable “very slightly deleterious mutations” accumulate in every individual, the overall health and ultimately the overall reproductive output of the population decline to below the level of replacement, ultimately resulting in extinction. 

See the problem?

In order for this to happen, two things must be true: There is no selection against deleterious mutations *even as reproductive output declines* (this is literally a contradiction), and deleterious mutations *must constantly accumulate* (impossible, as we saw above). 

Which means “genetic entropy” simply does not work. Period. 

And one more point: Assuming selection *does* occur (which, like, natural selection occurs, y’all), the implication is that every organism, every *genome* exists right on the precipice of experiencing a deleterious mutation and getting selected out, all the time. But we’ve adapted the repair mistakes, and live at an equilibrium where most mutations don’t do anyone one way or the other.  

Sanford’s argument *assumes* special creation because it *requires* an optimal “starting point” from which everything inevitably decays. That’s not what we see. Every genome has existed right on this knife’s edge, forever. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 4. Additional Points**

This is not an answer to every anti-evolution argument. This is an answer to one specific anti-evolution argument: “genetic entropy”.

If you, dear reader, think I am wrong, and that “genetic entropy” is a real thing that occurs, explain why the above reasoning is faulty. *Show your work*. 

That would involve showing how, given a realistic (or even an unrealistic, like those above) set of assumptions, deleterious mutations actually *do* accumulate constantly in a genome. 

It would *not* involve changing the topic to things like “well mutation and selection can’t build complex structures” or “selection constantly removes functions”. Those are *different* anti-evolution arguments, also invalid, *but are not the topic of this thread*. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 5: TL;DR**

Seriously? Just read the damn thing. 

Just kidding. 

For the normies who don’t think about this stuff during most waking (and some non-waking) moments, the point is that as bad mutations occur, the frequency of possible bad mutations decreases, and possible good mutations increases, eventually reaching equilibrium. Selection shifts that equilibrium further away from bad mutations. Since “genetic entropy” requires constant accumulation of bad mutations, and no selection against them, it can’t work.

DebateEvolution,etjksh,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.DebateEvolution,,I was asked to repost this here,"The RNA World Hypothesis

The RNA World Hypothesis: The Failure of Modern Origin-of-Life Theories

The RNA world hypothesis is the most developed origin-of-life theories so far, and it tries to explain how information in DNA, metabolism, and life itself originated. However, this post will show the utter failure of this theory to actually explain the origin of life.

The main premise of this theory is that, before the first living cells originated, the prebiotic world was composed of RNA and, later, RNA viruses. As RNA has been seen to self-replicate in some cases, and ribozymes, or catalytic enzymes like polymerases made of RNA, have been shown to exist, it is assumed that RNA could take the place of both DNA and proteins.

Once the first ribozyme polymerase (able to copy other RNA strands) originated, then strands could replicate, and the laws of natural selection and mutation could take over from there. As more and more complex ribozymes began to originate, and simple lipid cell membranes took them into their cavities, then simple metabolism could evolve. After this, ribonucleoproteins such as ribosomes could take over, and finally, simple cellular life could evolve.

The first hurdle that this theory comes to is the chemical evolution of nucleobases (A, U, G, and C). These are the molecules that encode information in DNA and cause ribozymes to work. Although some scientists suggest that specific nucleobases, such as adenine (A) [can be made by natural processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077245/), others accept that [nucleobases are unlikely to be created naturally](https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4396). Even to make a 0.5% concentration of adenine take unrealistically high concentrations of HCN that likely did not exist in early oceans. In our cells, there is a complex sequence of specific, metabolic proteins to make nucleobases. Also, the reaction that makes nucleobases from HCN makes many undesirable products that would interfere with RNA production.

Also, nucleobases have [very short half-lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20907/). At the temperatures of hydrothermal vents (more than 100 degrees Celsius), cytosine has a half-life of only 19 days, which means that the origin of life would have to have take place within only several years. I can’t stress enough how unlikely this would be.

The second hurdle the theory comes to is the making of ribose sugar. Ribose is the first component of the backbone of RNA (and the R in RNA). There is already a natural process that makes this sugar called the [formose reaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) which begins with formaldehyde. This has even been observed to take place at the temperatures and pressures of hydrothermal vents. The only problem with this is that [it cannot take place in the presence of nitrogenous compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453009), such as the ones that are formed from the production of nucleobases, This is because nitrogenous compounds would chemically react with the formaldehyde that is needed to start the reaction.

So, proponents of the RNA world theory need to explain how ribose could be made apart from the nucleobases, then come in contact with them in a high enough concentration to provoke a *thermodynamically uphill reaction*.

This brings us to the theory’s third hurdle, which is the making of nucleotides. These are the fundamental units of RNA, that are made from a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate ion. To form this, there would need to be a high concentration of phosphate. However, because phosphate is an ion, it is generally trapped in stable minerals. Any free PO^-3 will be quickly ‘snapped up’ by free calcium ions in the ocean. Though [some origin-of-life researchers think this could be solved with sulfur](https://cosmosmagazine.com/chemistry/life-without-phosphate-mystery-solved), there is no known analogue to RNA with anything other than phosphate.

Another problem with this is that the combination of nucleobases, ribose, and phosphate is a *thermodynamically uphill* reaction. To make nucleotides would require an outside source of energy and an extremely high concentration of each of these things, which is unlikely for the reasons previously mentioned.

Also, you need to make sure that the right nitrogen atom from the nucleobase bonds with the right carbon atom on the ribose sugar. In studies, only [8% of bonds were in the right place](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar50083a002), showing that even if the molecules did combine to form a nucleotide, 92% of them would be wrong, so any RNA strand formed from these would be extremely unlikely to work.

The final challenge to this theory, and the most problematic, is the actual forming of ribozymes. Even assuming that a significant concentration of nucleotides were formed, there are only a few sequences that actually produce an enzyme, so we run into the same problem as specified information in DNA.

Natural selection and copying could only begin after the first ribozyme polymerase was formed. [The shortest effective one yet is called 24-3](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9786), and it needs a specific sequence of bases 188 nucleotides in length to work. The chance of this forming randomly is one in 4^188, or approximately one in 10^113. Even assuming that the concentration was enough to produce a new RNA sequence every second, the chance of this forming in a million years is still one in 10^99. Given that, at best, life is given a billion years in evolutionary time to form, you can be sure that the RNA world literally would never form “in a billion years”.

DebateEvolution,esr9ns,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Mutation: Evidence for Common Ancestry?,"Is mutation the mechanism for gene creation, speciation, and common ancestry?

It is the Great White Hope, that the belief in common ancestry depends upon.

The belief:
*Random mutations have produced all the variety and complexity we see today, beginning with a single cell.*

This phenomenon has never been observed, cannot be repeated in rigorous laboratory conditions, flies in the face of observable science, yet is pitched as 'settled science!'

*Does mutation 'create' genes?*

No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'  Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.  

**E Coli**

I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

The ability to digest citrates, and mutate, does NOT indicate speciation, nor macro evolution.  It is an adaptation that ecoli was able to do, from inherent genetic abilities.  There is no indication of 'new genes!', or structural changes in the genome.   Ecoli remained ecoli, after over 66,000 generations, only adapting to micro climate conditions.   It is not proof, or evidence of, common ancestry.

Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  It is a deleterious process, that creates nothing.  The complex  features in living things cannot be explained by mutation..  the leap from a single celled amoeba to even a bacteria is untraceable and unexplainable by mutation.  The eye, flight, warm blood..  and countless variety in living organisms have no indication or evidence of being *caused* by mutation. There is nothing observable or repeatable, to compel a conclusion of mutation as an engine of increasing complexity.   It is a belief, with no empirical evidence.

Observation tells us that mutations are neutral, at best, or deleterious to the organism. It is not a creative power for complexity.  Even the claim of 'neutrality!' is based on presumption and decree.

The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen.

An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

A mutation only alters an existing trait, (or gene, exactly). It is not a selective process, but a deleterious one, that degrades the organism in almost every case.

Ecoli, adapting to digest citrates, is not evidence for common ancestry. It only shows the adaptability of this unique organism. It is not becoming anything else, or changing its genomic architecture.  It is still ecoli.

The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.  There is  no credible evidence of 'gene creation!' in any study to date. Mutations are not, 'new genes!' Selection, acting on existing variability, does not indicate new genes. Traits, variability, fantastically complex features.. hearing, seeing, flight, intelligence.. almost every trait known in the animal and plant kingdom have no empirical source. The belief in mutation, as a mechanism of increasing complexity has no scientific basis.   It is a religious belief, only.",1,73,1579775321,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/esr9ns/mutation_evidence_for_common_ancestry/

On page 468, it employs a circular argument beloved by evolutionists: the argument from homology. The same argument features in many different textbooks. And it is regularly cited by biologists in scolding the public about their Darwin doubts.

Here is a really brief, cute, and effective new video from Discovery Institute that addresses and deftly punctures this argument. Just eight minutes long!

Oh? Not an issue.

&gt;According to a robotically repeated talking point favored by evolution proponents, loyal adherence to Darwin’s theory is crucial to the future of biological research. Informing the public, including students, about the theory’s weaknesses as well as its strengths would thus threaten not only the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. It would even put lives in peril, since medical research would be handicapped. This might or might not explain the addled logic of a phone message we got over the past weekend from a critic of intelligent design who threatened that ID proponents are guilty of “treason” and should be handled by the law accordingly.

&gt;Yikes! Endangering your country’s health and wellbeing, if that were the case, would certainly not be a laudable act. But is a skeptical view of Darwinian theory really “anti-science,” as other critics like to say? Well, when you find something amazing, and there are countless amazing things in biology, you want to understand it. Does that require a Darwinian just-so story? These news items show otherwise. Students might become more motivated to study science, in fact, if given a sense of awe at nature’s wonders, without the usual appeals to happenstance.

Sounds like a strawman to me.

&gt;News from New York University begins without Darwin, and continues to approach the subject of DNA repair free of evolutionary shackles.

&gt;The scientists made DNA glow green, and introduced breaks that glowed red. Watching the reactions, they found that broken areas became denser and moved more quickly as repair processes acted on them. No evolution was required to increase understanding that could potentially better our health.

Oh? https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-26887-1_11
Learning why, is just as important as well as the how it works.

&gt;Those who like to bake salmon have undoubtedly been struck by the chevron shapes in the muscles. All fish have this characteristic pattern, which “is thought to increase swimming efficiency,” according to research from the National University of Singapore (NUS). How does the pattern come about? Is it genetically driven, or is there some other process at work? The scientists didn’t even consider Darwinian evolution as they sought the answer.

&gt;Notably, several mentions of evolution in the PNAS paper have nothing to do with Darwinism, but rather with the unfolding (“evolution”) of the patterns during development. One brief exception mentions that “the shape is tightly controlled and may be evolutionarily optimized.” Performing a Darwin-ectomy on that sentence would cause no harm to the science.

Yes, because we shouldn't consider how these processes come about. I mean it's not like embryology is important to evolution yes? https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-beneficial-consequences-of-having-chevron-or-V-shaped-myomeres-illustrated-using_fig2_225306766

&gt;Another paper in PNAS about epigenetics does perfectly fine without appeals to Darwinian evolution. The “Perspective” article by Aristizabel et al., “Biological embedding of experience: A primer on epigenetics,” includes only one reference to “evolutionary time”:

Yes, because passing on modified genes has nothing to do with evolution huh?

 &gt;As more scientific research proceeds in the absence of references to unguided evolution, science will get stronger, leaner, and more motivated. Let the Darwin stories go, and free up science for a resurgence of awe and wonder that first motivated early scientists.

Evolution is not a force in off itself, but of multiple processes like DNA repair, mutations, embryology. Evolution is the umbrella that brings these studies together and how they affect one another. 

Likewise these studies only show what is going on but not why...as in why things are this way. 

By telling people to ignore Darwinism then, you are limiting their curosity.

&gt;It will take some radical surgery to remove the Darwinian concepts in the Grants’ paper, but will the science survive? Take a closer look at what they actually found. First of all, they admit that the effect of introgressive hybridization on adaptive radiation is “not known.” Ponder that for a moment. After 160 years, has Darwinism been so useless that it has not shed light on a process that should have been well known by now, particularly with these iconic birds? Even worse, though, is that introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system. Search for “selection” in the paper and you find only faith, not evidence, that natural selection might work in tandem with introgressive hybridization to produce new species. The only examples of selection they offer involve microevolution, not innovation. For those, they do lateral passes to other Darwinists in the references. 

Wait what did you say?
&gt;introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system.

But you are describing evolution but say that it isn't evolution. Decent by modification! How does shuffilling around genetic information not cause an increase in information?!

&gt;Their work not only relies on Darwinism, but promises to help future research. How could anyone claim that Darwinism is useless to this paper? Actually, it’s quite easy. It’s as easy as showing that any other kind of circular reasoning is useless in science. These seven biologists assumed evolution, and concluded evolution. The observations had nothing to do with it.

From the study they link to: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/42/21094.short

&gt;Echolocation is a prime example of convergent evolution, the independent gain of similar features in species of different lineages. Is phenotypic convergence driven by underlying molecular convergence? If so, could molecular convergence include contributions from highly constrained, often-pleotropic, coding regions? We develop a generalizable test that offers a resounding “yes” to both extensively debated questions. Our test highlights molecular convergence in genes regulating the cochlear ganglion of echolocating bats and whales, the skin of aquatic mammals, and the lung of high-altitude mammals. Importantly, the approach correctly dismisses confounding convergence-like patterns, such as those from sequence decay of vision genes in blind subterranean species, and is readily applicable to the thousands of genomes sequenced across the tree of life.

How do they respond?

&gt;Some extreme examples can show the fallacy. Humans and turtles can hold their breath underwater. Is that convergent evolution? Turtles can’t think, but humans can. Is that divergent evolution? If tricycles and race cars alike are found to contain both aluminum and iron, did they obtain those through blind, unguided processes? So it is with two very different mammals — bats and whales — that use sound for echolocation. Neither the similarities nor differences prove convergent evolution (or divergent evolution, for that matter), unless you start with that assumption. It’s a non sequitur to conclude they evolved.

It would be very problematic if many species were found that combined characteristics of different nested groupings. Some nonvascular plants could have seeds or flowers, like vascular plants, but they do not. Gymnosperms (e.g. conifers or pines) occasionally could be found with flowers, but they never are. Non-seed plants, like ferns, could be found with woody stems; however, only some angiosperms have woody stems.

Conceivably, some birds could have mammary glands or hair; some mammals could have feathers (they are an excellent means of insulation). Certain fish or amphibians could have differentiated or cusped teeth, but these are only characteristics of mammals.
These patterns are here because evolution predicts that a new trait will emerge from an existing trait. These traits will be cultivated by the environment as they will help organisms live long enough to reproduce and pass on those traits with modification.
A mix and match of characters would make it extremely difficult to objectively organize species into nested hierarchies. Unlike organisms, cars do have a mix and match of characters, and this is precisely why a nested hierarchy does not flow naturally from classification of cars. Indeed a designer wouldn't need to follow any patter because it wouldn't have the same limitation as evolution and thus wouldn't need to follow the same pattern.

DebateEvolution,er0vih,DefenestrateFriends,PhD Genetics/MS Medicine Student,t2_g050d,self.DebateEvolution,,An evaluation of the genetic entropy hypothesis by a genetic scientist,"Hi folks,  
   
I have been discussing the principle tenets of an allele-frequency hypothesis called “Genetic Entropy” with a proponent. Many of you have seen this hypothesis floating around on the sub before and many of you have given it critical feedback. I’m hoping to add to that conversation by highlighting some of the scientific and technical reasons why this hypothesis is unsupported. I’m mostly going to focus on the data and not on the downstream conclusions about creationism or word choices like “entropy.”   
 

*Background:*   
What is genetic entropy (GE)? GE is a hypothesis proposed by Dr. John Sanford which predicts that functionally deleterious single-nucleotide mutations are inherited with each generation and accumulate in the organism/population. The accumulation of these mutations is then hypothesized to result in the progressive loss of integrity (hence the “entropy”) in a genome causing increased disease prevalence and ultimately death of the organism. It is then argued that if GE occurs, evolution is not possible since the organism is progressively experiencing a degradation in fitness which is not surmounted by positive selection. Essentially this hypothesis is an extreme form of Error Catastrophe which postulates that all life on earth operates past the critical mutation rate threshold.  

These are the four basic premises that must be true for functionally deleterious mutations to accumulate:   
 

1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations

2) Most mutations are very small in effect

3) The vast majority of mutations are damaging

4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

 

*What are mutations?*   
   
Mutation: a variant or change in the heritable material of an organism. Normally, we refer to mutations as “variants” because of all the different forms and effects they can take on—substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, conversion, frame shift, extension, synonymous, non-synonymous, DNA/RNA, transposons, linear, circular, coding, non-coding, imprinting, methylation, base adducts, structural, non-structural, pathogenic, clinical, loss of function, gain of function, etc.  
 

When referring to a mutation, it’s important to adequately describe the type of mutation occurring. I primarily study human genetics and so I use the nomenclature proposed by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) with the database ascension and human genome version identifiers. For example, the genomic identifier for a single-nucleotide variant in one of my favorite genes, MC1R, is NC\_000016.9:g.89986117C&gt;A. The protein identifier for that same variant is NP\_002377.4:p.Arg151Ser and the coding DNA identifier is NM\_002386.3:c.451C&gt;A.  
 

The mutation rate in humans is something around 1.0 × 10^(−9) mutations/nucleotide/year (95% CI: 3.0 × 10^(−10)–2.5 × 10^(−9)), or 3.0 × 10^(−8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95% CI: 8.9 × 10^(−9)–7.0 × 10^(−8)). Some loci (coding is lower, non-coding is higher, chromatin access etc) mutate at different rates than others and de novo mutation rates are affected by life-history traits of the parents (age, exposures, etc) in a sex-specific manner. When measured directly, trio probands show between 20 and 155 de novo mutations per offspring with an average around 40. 

What is evolution?

1. Evolution is defined as the change in allele frequencies in a population over generations.

2. Evolution is a process that occurs by 6 mechanisms: mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating, recombination, and natural selection. Sometimes this is referred to as 4 primary and 2 ancillary mechanisms because mating and recombination fall under the natural selection umbrella.

3. Evolution is not abiogenesis.

4. Evolutionary processes explain the diversity of life on Earth.

5. Evolution is not a moral or ethical claim.

6. Evidence for evolution comes in the forms of anatomical structures, biogeography, fossils, direct observation, and molecular biology--namely genetics. Genetic evidence is overwhelming and outweighs the others.

7. There are many ways to differentiate species. The classification of species is a manmade construct, is somewhat arbitrary, and varies across fields.  


*What is neutral theory, nearly neutral theory, and selectionist theory?* 

Population genetics is often concerned with which mechanism of evolution contributes more to allele change frequencies in a population. The two primary mechanisms seem to be natural selection and genetic drift. Neutral theory posits that variation mainly arises from stochastic processes (i.e. genetic drift) which distribute functionally neutral alleles and was proposed by Kimura Motoo in 1955/1968. Nearly neutral theory is an extension of neutral theory proposed by Tomoko Ohta in 1973. She suggested that natural selection can be overpowered by genetic drift in special circumstances relating to the size of the effective mating population and allows for slightly deleterious mutations to reach fixation. Once the effective population size gets large enough, natural selection overtakes influence on that allele and it is purified from the population. Selectionist theory posits that variation is primarily due to advantageous alleles propagated in a population. Neutral theory is now mostly used as a null hypothesis to detect selection.  
 

Neutralist and selectionist mechanisms both contribute to variation within in populations. I should also mention that anyone trying to base their understanding of current evolutionary processes should not use publications from the 60’s and 70’s. These papers and theories were proposed nearly 50 years before we had the data to adequately interrogate their predictions. There are numerous errors in Kimura’s model (didn’t know how many base pairs there were in the human genome or about codon bias etc.), but many of the basic predictions were true.  
 

Here’s a paper that explains the history and evidences for neutral theory:   
 Hughes AL. Near neutrality: leading edge of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. *Ann N Y Acad Sci*. 2008;1133:162–179. doi:10.1196/annals.1438.001

Here is a paper that explains the problems with neutral theory:  
 Kern, A. D. &amp; Hahn, M. W. The Neutral Theory in Light of Natural Selection. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **35**, 1366–1371 (2018).

 

*What are neutral mutations?*

Much of the discussion seems to revolve around the definition and existence of neutral mutations. There seems to have been some confusion when articulating the GE position because it attempts to appropriate operational language from the neutral theory of evolution. Here are the correct definitions of these terms.  
   
The action of a mutation can be defined in one of two ways: operationally or functionally. The operational definition describes how the mutation propagates in a population. The functional definition describes what the mutation does at the molecular level to the organism.  
 

Kimura using the operational definitions of mutation, since the frequency is OPERATIONALLY dependent on the POPULATION SIZE:

(17a) the mutant is **advantageous** such that **2Nes&gt;&gt;1**

(17b) it is **deleterious** such that **2Nes &gt;&gt;1 in which s‘=-s**

(17c) it is **almost neutra**l such that **|2Nes| &lt;&lt; 1**.

Kimura using the functional definition of mutation, since the function of the allele depends on the FITNESS CONFERRED and NOT the population size:

“These results suggest that mutations having a **definite advantage or disadvantage** can not contribute greatly to the heterozygosity of an individual because of the **rare occurrence of advantageous mutations and rapid elimination of deleterious ones.”**

**“Assuming that the majority of molecular mutations due to base substitution is almost neutral for natural selection** and that they occur at the rate of 2 per gamete per generation\[...\]”

\[And several other places in this paper and in all of his works\]

Kimura, M. Genetic variability maintained in a finite population due to mutational production of neutral and nearly neutral isoalleles. *Genet. Res.* **11**, 247–270 (1968).  
 

Having a mastery and understanding of these terms is important because a mutation can be called operationally neutral but be functionally highly deleterious. This is why we consider the functional consequences of a mutation and not the operational descriptor. Here’s an example:   
 

If a deleterious mutation with *s* = −0.001 occurs in a population of *N* = 106, |*s*| is much greater than 1/(2*N*) = 5 × 3 10^(−7). The fitness of mutant homozygotes will be lower than that of wild-type homozygotes only by 0.002. This fitness difference is easily swamped by the large random variation in the number of offspring among different individuals, by which *s* is defined. By contrast, in the case of brother-sister mating *N* = 2, so that even a semi-lethal mutation with *s* = −0.25 will be called neutral. If this mutation is fixed in the population, the mutant homozygote has a fitness of 0.5 compared with the nonmutant homozygote. A fitness decrease of half is removed from the population by natural selection.  
   
Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **22**, 2318–42 (2005).

&amp;#x200B;

*Are the majority of mutations deleterious or neutral?* 

Proponents of the GE hypothesis are quick to point out that, “most experts in the field believe that the majority of mutations are deleterious.” Popular quotes are plucked from the works of:  
 

Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. The fitness effects of spontaneous mutations nearly unseen by selection in a bacterium with multiple chromosomes. *Genetics* **204**, 1225–1238 (2016).

Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley, P. D. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. *Nature Reviews Genetics* **8**, 610–618 (2007).

Keightley, P. D. &amp; Lynch, M. Toward a realistic model of mutations affecting fitness. *Evolution* **57**, 683–685 (2003).

Kimura, M. Model of effectively neutral mutations in which selective constraint is incorporated. *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.* **76**, 3440–3444 (1979).

&amp;#x200B;

Of note, GE proponents selectively misquote these works and apply the authors’ quotes to the entire genome when only the coding-regions are specifically addressed. For example:   
 

The GE proponent quotes Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007):

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small.”  
 

The full quote in context (ibid.): 

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However, there is **a class of mutations that we can term effectively neutral**. These are mutations **for which** ***Nes*** **is much less than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random genetic drift.** As such, the definition of neutrality **is operational rather than functional**; it depends on **whether natural selection is effective on the mutation in the population or the genomic context in which it segregates**, not solely on the effect of the mutation on fitness.”

These definitions form Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) are specifically referencing mutation accumulation (MA) assays which historically interrogated only coding-region mutations. More recent MA experiments often characterize whole genome mutations such as in Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. (2016).  Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) go on to say:   
 

“Unfortunately, accurate measurement of the **effects of single mutations is possible only when they have fairly large effects on fitness** (say &gt;1%; that is, a mutation that increases or decreases viability or fertility by more than 1%)”

“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95% and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50% of mutations are deleterious.**”

After being presented with the contextualized quotes, GE acolytes tend to ignore this dilemma and try to quote other sources such as the MA experiments conducted by Dillon *et al.* (2016). 

&amp;#x200B;

GE supporters believe that MA experiments adequately represent natural evolutionary phenomena and that the results favor the GE hypothesis. Here’s why that is untrue: 

1. MA experiments **do not allow natural selection to happen**, meaning that the deleterious mutations cannot be selected out from the populations.

2. Bacterial strains used in MA experiments have certain DNA repair genes **disabled so that MORE mutations occur** i.e.—not natural

3. The coding regions in these species represent **HUGE portions of their total genome 80-90% versus 10-20% noncoding**. The human genome is about 1% coding.

4. The **majority of mutations are not deleterious** \[as shown in these experiments and in direct opposition to GE premises stated earlier\] and that only rarely occurring mutations cause the fitness declination observed in these studies.

This means, MA experiments a) don't support GE in the slightest and b) are not analogs for human evolution.

Here are the results from Dillon *et al.* (2016) MA experiment:

In the M9MM environment, 4 mutation carriers even had greater fitness than the ancestral genome. This means that effects of the mutations are dependent on the environment i.e.—natural selection. Here are several quotes from that paper demonstrating that more neutral mutations occur than deleterious mutations even in the near absence of natural selection:

“Specifically, MA experiments **limit the efficiency of natural selection** by passaging replicate lineages through repeated single-cell bottlenecks.”

“Here, we measured the relative fitness of 43 fully sequenced MA lineages derived from *Burkholderia cenocepacia* HI2424 in three laboratory environments after they had been evolved **in the near absence of natural selection for 5554 generations**. Following the MA experiment, each lineage harbored a total **mutational load of 2–14 spontaneous mutations**, including base substitution mutations (bpsms), insertion-deletion mutations (indels), and whole-plasmid deletions.”

“Lastly, the genome of *B. cenocepacia* is composed of **6,787,380 bp (88.12%) coding DNA** and **915,460 bp (11.88%) noncoding DNA**. Although both bpsms and indels were observed more frequently than expected in noncoding DNA (bpsms: χ2 = 2.19, d.f. = 1, *P* = 0.14; indels: χ2 = 45.816, d.f. = 1, *P* &lt; 0.0001)”

“In combination, these results suggest that the fitness effects of **a majority of spontaneous mutations were near neutral, or at least undetectable**, with plate-based laboratory fitness assays. Given the average selection coefficient of each line and the number of mutations that it harbors, we can estimate that the **average fitness effect (*****s*****) of a single mutation was –0.0040 ± 0.0052 (SD) in TSOY, –0.0031 ± 0.0044 (SD) in M9MM+CAA, and –0.0017 ± 0.0043 (SD) in M9MM**.”

“Despite acquiring multiple mutations, the fitness of a number of MA lineages **did not differ significantly from the ancestral strain.** Further, the number of spontaneous mutations in a line **did not correlate with their absolute selection coefficients** in any environment (Spearman’s rank correlation; TSOY: d.f. = 41, *S* = 15742, rho = –0.1886, *P* = 0.2257; M9MM+CAA: d.f. = 41, *S* = 13190, rho = 0.0041, *P* = 0.9793; and M9MM: d.f. = 41, *S* = 16293, rho = –0.2303, *P* = 0.1374)”

“Because the fitness of many lineages with multiple mutations did not significantly differ from the ancestor, and because mutation number and fitness were not correlated, this study suggests **that most of the significant losses and gains in fitness were caused by rare, single mutations with large fitness effects.**”

“Here, we estimate that *s* ≅ 0 in all three environments, **largely because the vast majority of mutations appear to have near neutral effects on fitness**. These estimates **are remarkably similar** to estimates from studies of MA lines with fully characterized mutational load in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *S. cerevisiae* (Lynch *et al.* 2008; Heilbron *et al.* 2014), but are lower than estimates derived from unsequenced MA lineages (Halligan and Keightley 2009; Trindade *et al.* 2010).”

The GE proponent that I was discussing with ignored the paper’s conclusion and focused on this quote in the discussion section of the paper:   
 

""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007; Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""

After pointing out that these experiments are explicitly referring to coding-region mutations context, hyper mutation strains, or non-sequencing fitness assays which do not assess total mutations; the GE proponent again tried to quote mine Heilbron *et al.* (2014) paper: 

""After 644 generations of mutation accumulation, MA lines had accumulated an average of 118 mutations, and we found that average fitness across all lines decayed linearly over time.""

The conclusion of Heilbron *et al.* (2014) was ignored by the GE proponent: 

“These steps did not contain a significantly greater number of mutations than the remaining steps (mean of five largest steps: 9.0 mutations, mean of remainder: 7.9 mutations, paired *t*\-test: *P* = 0.285, *t*4 = 1.235). However, these large deleterious steps showed a significantly higher frequency of mutations in highly conserved core genes than other steps (χ2 goodness-of-fit test: *P* = 0.049, χ21 = 3.882; [Table S2](http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.114.163147/-/DC1/genetics.114.163147-6.pdf)). Therefore, large drops in fitness **are due to mutations in more important genes rather than due to a greater number of mutations**.”  
 

This is exactly what MA experiments are designed to do—normally natural selection prunes these heavily deleterious mutations from the population, however, NS is controlled in MA experiments and therefore this doesn’t happen. GE requires a greater number of deleterious mutations than neutral mutations which is the exact opposite of what this paper shows even in the near absence of NS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of pointing to contrived MA experiments to support GE, proponents should use sequencing data from humans and perform a real analysis. I have challenged GE supporters to do this on several occasions which have been ignored. Here is my analysis:   
 

Gómez-Romero et al. (2018) identified de novo mutations in the offspring of a trio proband. 58 mutations were found with 35x coverage on the parents and 100x on the child. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variants (barring PCR primer difficulties).

[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115)

The variants identified in this study can be found in Table S4: [https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf)

Using these 58 mutations, please exactly list their character as “neutral” “deleterious” or “beneficial.” Then let us know the method you employed, the ratio of deleterious to neutral, and at what point the child in this study will go “extinct.”

If you cannot do this simple task, then you cannot test GE and you lose.

**Hint: I have already done the analysis with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)**. The analysis can be viewed here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr\_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0)

Of the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.

Conclusion:   
The GE hypothesis is not supported by data and primarily relies on misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers. I'm calling this fallacy of misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers while never doing experiments (appropriated unapologetically and nonconsensually from another user) ""The Atheist Jesus."" This is a fallacy committed by those who believe quoting scientists is an adequate method to demonstrate scientific validity in the absence of hypothesis testing. For example:  
""Charles Darwin said \[XYZ\] about evolution, therefore evolution isn't true."" Charles Darwin is not ""The Atheist Jesus"" and his words carry no scientific validity until tested.

He says, ""It seems to say that there are not very many ways in which proteins can evolve, but this is exactly what ID science has determined already."" Except that's not what the article says, and that's not what ID claims, either.

[The paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1126/science.1123539) is from Science, 312(5770), 111–114.

The quick and dirty is that scientists observed that a certain (Beta)-lactamase allele increased resistance to an antibiotic by about 100,000x. The researchers discovered that this allele differs from the normal variation of this allele by five point mutations. All five of these mutations must be done for the new allele to be highly resistant.

The paper explains that to reach these five mutations, there are 120 different pathways that could be reached. However, only certain orders increase the resistance and would benefit the bacterium.

Through models and experimentation, the researchers discovered that certain mutations either were deleterious or neutral, while others had limited fixation rates in the population. This means that through natural selection, only certain pathways toward the five mutations could be realized to become resistant.

The paper does not argue that proteins have limited paths to form. The paper only looks at one allele with multiple mutations required to reach it, and what pathways would be favorable or even plausible to make a population retain those steps before reaching the allele with high resistance.

The paper even concludes with this:

&gt; Our conclusion is also consistent with results from prospective experimental evolution studies, in which replicate evolutionary realizations have been observed to follow largely identical mutational trajectories. However, the retrospective, combinatorial strategy employed here substantially enriches our understanding of the process of molecular evolution because it enables us to characterize all mutational trajectories, including those with a vanishingly small probability of realization [which is otherwise impractical]. This is important because it draws attention to the mechanistic basis of selective inaccessibility. It now appears that intramolecular interactions render many mutational trajectories selectively inaccessible, which implies that replaying the protein tape of life might be surprisingly repetitive.

That is, because there are only a limited number of pathways, and those pathways require certain steps to be in place for the next mutation, we can repeat this process once the winning trajectories start to become fixated. We know that this happens not only from this paper but also from Lenski's E. coli experiment.

So this again puts to rest the need for a designer, and just shows that random mutation + natural selection can come to novel features given the proper pressures, attempts and time.",1,74,1579328271,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eqcv4q/umrh2_wants_some_help_understanding_the_paper/

Unfortunately, there are so many outright lies, misrepresentations, complete ignorance and other such fatal problems with the slides that they're only useful for how not to make any arguments for one side or against another.

**Slide 1** is just the title card.

**Slide 2** is the table of contents. It lists pages even though this is a slide show. Not that big of a deal.

**Slide 3** is the title card for the first section, ""Science.""

**Slide 4** is the PRATT about ""observational vs. historical science."" This is just one of Ken Ham's complete fabrications about how science fits into two categories, of which one is just unverifiable (you'll never guess which one evolution falls into!). But the worst part are the points for each side.

Observational includes ""Composed of empirical evidence,"" ""Can be independently verified"" and ""No initial assumptions."" The first and third don't fit into what would be considered observations in science. You can make observations without running an experiment. And you can make assumptions before observations as well.

For historical, we get the points ""Rests on (but not composed of) empirical evidence,"" ""Cannot be independently verified"" and ""Rests on initial assumptions / worldviews."" All of these are also incorrect, since processes that happened in the past can be measured via experiment, can be verified independently by others who try to replicate such experiments, and don't require any particular world views or need any more assumptions than testing a hypothesis.

So already we are on the first slide of claims and nearly every single one fails.

**Slide 5** are six ""things we know from operational science."" Yet all of these are part of evolutionary biology.

**Slide 6** asks the question, ""Does operational data translate into historical theories?"" with a question mark over two paths coming from ""Things we know: DNA, Proteins, Mutation, Natural Selection, Fossils, Genetics"" and going to either ""Evolution"" or ""Creation."" And that's it. The ""Science"" section makes no other case other than wrongly suggesting that there's two types of science, operational and historical.

&gt;The proof: Erosion rates are too fast to be consistent with an old earth.
There are 2,000 arches remaining in Arches National Park. They are collapsing at a rate of one per year. In 2,000 years they will all be gone. https://creation.com/age-of-arches

This argument makes two erroneous assumptions, first that all of the arches present were present at the moment of creation, and secondly that new arches are not being formed. 

The sandstone that makes up arches was burred deep underground 65 million years ago, wrinkled like a dirty shirt. Uplift and erosion recently exposed it to the surface. Today water and freeze thaw weathering are producing arches. 

&gt;The White Cliffs of Dover (deposited during the Cretaceous period) are eroding at a rate of 1 meter every 6 years. If the cliffs have been eroding at 1 meter every 6 years since the end of the Cretaceous, more than 10,000 km of coastline would have eroded away -- the distance from London to Cape Town, South Africa. England must have been HUGE back in the day. https://creation.com/vanishing-coastlines

Much like the previous argument, this argument erroneously assumes a constant rate of erosion. Poor beach management, increased storms, and acidification of the ocean has increased erosion in the last 150 years. According to [Science World Report](https://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/51981/20161110/historic-white-cliffs-dover-vanish-study-reveals.htm) the rate of erosion is 22 to 32cm per year.

&gt;""People speak about millions of years so easily. It rolls off the tongue. But when we think about what these unimaginable eons of time actually mean, we find they do not match what we observe. The erosion we see on the coastlines all over the world is not consistent with the idea of millions of years.""

I'm always curious what a YEC thinks the earth will look like in millions of years. 

The consistent assumption that deposition, mountain building, volcanism etc. do not occur today is tiresome.",1,28,1579235109,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epvcuz/more_arguments_to_debunk_from_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,epu40z,SaggysHealthAlt,Young Earth Creationist,t2_4h4ws52t,self.DebateEvolution,,A few questions on Abiogenesis from a Creationist recently receiving lots of attention.,"Hi r/debateevolution! It's about time I make my own post here. I've been receiving attention, usually negative attention, getting called over from my fortress at r/creation. What else could I expect from you guys when I post things like the 95 thesis against Evolution in my own subreddit completely minding my own business? Nevermind that, I got a few questions for you guys!

1. Abiogenesis is yet to be proven either naturally or expirementally. Based on the fossil record you guys interprete as evidence of Evolution of less complex forms to more complex, it can be assumed that as seculars you would find that  abiogenesis did occur regardless of what observable science has to say about it right now. Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occuring relies on *historical science*? 

2. If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

3. Let's say, if abiogenesis did occur naturally, how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

4. Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

5. Let's say that abiogenesis occured and it got food. How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

6. Let's say everything above was answered. Abiogenesis occured, it got it's food, it knew how to make another cell. Now how did this thing get a genome?

7. Ok, so it somehow, somewhere, from some place, the genome is now in this cell. Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

8. Let's say all problems above are solved. There are problems whatsoever. Now look out your window and see the trees, grass, people, life everywhere. The city, town, rural land around you.  Now ask yourself, do you actually believe you came from this thing?

I hope to get rational answers for my rational questions. You don't always get a Creationist leaving his fortress willing to see what no man's land has in store for him.",1,35,1579228860,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epu40z/a_few_questions_on_abiogenesis_from_a_creationist/

DebateEvolution,eo5aw2,ursisterstoy,Evolutionist,t2_ni1r89j,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The evidence for evolution from common ancestry is overwhelming.,"https://youtu.be/Jw0MLJJJbqc

Genetics, phylogenetics, homology, morphology, embryology, and every other line of evidence regarding the diversification of life paints the same picture. 

For an example we can compare humans to chimpanzees, because this is rather controversial for creationists.

Through genetics we have found that we share 98.4% coding gene similarity and by comparing the whole genome the similarity drops to around 96%. This includes genes located in the same location on the same chromosomes, the merger of chromosome 2A and 2B into a single chromosome in humans. Endogenous retroviruses in the same location. The same gene for producing vitamin C broke in the same way in the same location. It isn’t just enough to say there was a common designer when psueudogenes and viruses are found in both lineages in the same location. Also, the molecular clock based on average mutation rates and parsimony places the point of divergence to around six million years ago.

Shared homology shows that we have the same number of hair follicles, the same muscles attached to the same bones, humans having juvenile chimpanzee shaped skulls into adulthood, a fused tail bone in place of an actual tail, fingerprints, pectoral mammary glands - just two of them, we have the same organs with chimpanzee brains developing in the same way but halting earlier. We can both walk bipedally and also climb trees with our grasping hands. The males have reduced bones or no bones at all in their naked pendulous penises.  Also homology is more than just similar shaped body parts having the same name where arms being composed of one bone followed by two followed by small wrist bones followed by hand and finger bones and never in a different order because they are the same bones connected the same way and not just similar bones taking the same function. A non-homologous trait would be the different style wings of birds, bats, and pterosaurs as they have the same arms but different wings. The arms show common ancestry, the wings show convergent evolution. 

Morphology is related to homology but includes all features that look the same regardless of how they formed - showing that they evolved to fit the same function, with homology being the best type of morphology showing shared ancestry with other morphological traits showing shared environmental pressures. Both are consistent with common ancestry as the common ancestor would be from the same location being the same animal. 

Embryology is based on how organisms develop. Ontogeny takes this from zygote to adulthood. The closer related an organism is the more similar they are for longer throughput their ontogeny with the earliest stages of embryonic development showing how we are related to larger categories of organisms. The sperm cells being opisthokonts categorizes us with other opisthokonts like fungi. The development within amniotic fluid makes us a specific type of animal related to all living reptiles, birds, and mammals more closely than salamanders and living fish. The way our organs develop takes us through the phylogeny of our ancestry and by the time we arrive at the latest stages of development we are strikingly similar to the other great apes, especially chimpanzees based on brain development and other features that show common ancestry. 

The fossil record contains thousands of intermediate forms that match up strikingly well with the other lines of evidence providing us tangible evidence for common ancestry without genetics. Sahelanthropus, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and several intermediate forms within our own genus shows evolution occurring over time when we account for the ages of the fossils and the layers in which they are found - making geology another independent line of evidence for evolution over time when paleontology shows that these fossils are found to be in the expected age ranges and geographical locations that only make sense if there was actual evolution occurring over time and is incompatible with all of these intermediate forms existing at the same time.

And finally, phylogeny takes the evidence from all of these other fields. Simply feeding genetic data into a program that compares similarity produces the same phylogenetic relationships as morphology and embryology produce with few differences. When there are differences in phylogeny, it is genetics that takes precedence. 

Is there anything factual that can debunk common ancestry? If there is, it hasn’t been demonstrated. Creationists, the ball is in your court to support your alternative.",1,224,1578928115,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eo5aw2/the_evidence_for_evolution_from_common_ancestry/

DebateEvolution,entwuz,theHating,,t2_3ywzyhmj,self.DebateEvolution,,I AM NOT A CREATIONIST.,"I had to repost this here because apparently the moderators at r/evolution either dont know how to read or just like to pretend they know how to read.  In any event, they advised me to dump this gasoline tanker all over the creationism debate, enjoy.

To restate, my intention here, as laid out in the OP, is to refute the following two claims:

1. There exists something that can sensibly be called ""THE theory of evolution"", and

2. The theory of evolution ""fits all the facts""



Near the start of their seminal 1972 paper on punctuated equilibria, Niles Eldredge and co-author Stephen Jay Gould specify the position they are militating against: the traditional Darwin-based theory of slow, steady, adaptive evolution. They refer to it as ""phyletic gradualism"".

Gould and Eldredge identify the following four tenets of phyletic gradualism (and I quote):

(1) New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendents

(2) The transformation is even and slow

(3) The transformation involves large numbers, usually the entire ancestral population

(4) The transformation occurs over all or a large part of the ancestral species' geographical range


One of the testable implications of phyletic gradualism is (and I quote again):

""Ideally, the fossil record for the origin of a new species should consist of a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant""



Now, as some of you may have discovered yourselves, you can show a frothing Darwinian pretty much anything you like and still be told, ""That's perfectly in accordance with my theory. My theory fits all the facts  "".

On the other hand, both thoughtful Darwinians (including CD himself) and their opponents have been aware since the publication of 'Origin' that phyletic gradualism does not fit all the facts: The fossil record does not typically consist of ""a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant"".

Few are more keenly aware of this theoretical embarrassment than paleontologists such as Eldredge and Gould themselves.


Does this mean, then, that phyletic gradualism is falsified and must be abandoned? Well, loyal patrons of my ""Falsifiability"" thread will hopefully be aware by now that there is rarely, if ever, a definitive refutation in empirical science. If its defenders are stubborn -- and ingenuous! -- enough, a seemingly troubled theory can always be shielded from falsification by (say) appeal to unrecognized forces or hidden variables, by postulating an undiscovered planet or subatomic particle, or by conjuring up a cosmological constant (as Einstein did).

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range



Conclusion:

""THE theory of evolution"", you say? Er, which one? 

""Fits/explains all the facts"", you say? Er, what does? ",1,96,1578865069,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/entwuz/i_am_not_a_creationist/

[Here's the paper.](https://sci-hub.se/10.1126/science.1153717)

In particular, I want to focus on the data in [figure 3b](https://i.imgur.com/5XGrfOq.png). This figure shows the correlation between the levels of genetic diversity in various human population and the distance of each from East Africa. 

In the context of human evolution, this makes perfect sense. We first appeared in East Africa, and as we radiated outwards we experienced serial founder events, reducing diversity in non-African populations. Further from Addis Ababa, less diversity. Exactly as expected.

But what's the creationist explanation for these data? How do these findings fit in that paradigm? I'm talking Young Earth, but you still run into just raw diversity problems if you start with a population of N=2, even in the Old Earth timeframe. So answers from either angle are appreciated.

DebateEvolution,emmt8j,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Scientific consensus and evolution.,"I'm currently reading *Why Trust Science* by Naomi Oreskes. She's probably most well known for writing *Merchants of Doubt* with Erik M. Conway.

I'm about half done the book and am enjoying it. While the topic of this subreddit hasn't reared its ugly head, she did mention creation.com, and Mike Pence being a YEC.

In the book she argues that scientific consensus is a very useful tool for determining if we can trust science.  She cited eugenics and continental drift as two areas of study that while commonly argued had arrived at consensus, there was no consensus. In the first point she argued that social scientists and some prominent geneticists were both opposed to eugenics, and while American geologists were largely opposed to continental drift, European geologists accepted it more readily, or at least refused to pass judgment. 

Oreskes suggests asking five questions when determine the validity of scientific consensus. 

1. Do the individual in the community bring to bear different perspectives? Do they represent a range of perspectives in terms of ideas, theoretical commitments, methodological preferences and personal value?

2. Have different methods been applied and diverse lines of evidence considered?

3. Has there been ample opportunity for dissenting views to be heard, considered, and weighted?

4. Is the community open to new information and able to be self-critical?

5. Is the community demographically diverse: in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, country of origin, and the like?

While I'm sure some creationists will object to 3 and 4, I think the answer when discussing evolution is a resounding yes.

/u/MRH2 posted these two ideas thinking that they logically cause problems with evolution. It's a safe bet that he just gets these ideas wrong, but let's still investigate his claims.

Claim #1:

""First, in terms of evolution and adaptation, I don't see how evolution can create **stable complex ecosystems.**"" (emphasis his).

He uses an example of the zebra, impala and lion.

&gt; There is a huge environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion.

No, no there's no environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion. Evolution doesn't work on what someone thinks should be the goal. If a trait forms that allows for the impala to run faster, then that trait likely will propagate to future generations because slower impala will be eaten. But there are other mechanisms which have developed to keep prey from being eaten, such as tougher armor, foul taste, etc. ""Be faster"" is just one trait that several species have evolved over time, and it benefited their populations so it propagated better to offspring over generations.

&gt; Now we've all seen evolution do amazing things, like evolve hearts and lungs, so making an impala be fast enough (or skillful enough) to avoid capture should not be too hard.

Impalas are fast, yes, but to argue that they should evolve to be fast enough to avoid capture and this being an easy evolution is again ignorant of how evolution works. Any advantage that evolves has a trade-off somewhere. Running faster may lead to limbs that are weaker for other things, or requiring more proteins to sustain, or so forth. So it's not just something that is ""easy"" but a matter of whether the advantage outweighs the negative for producing viable offspring. Also, once again, evolution doesn't work on goals. ""Being faster is good"" doesn't mean that species will just evolve methods to being faster. That's just not how it works.

&gt; Now the lion can also evolve. It loves to eat zebra which are not particularly fast. Again, it wouldn't take much, compared to the convergent evolution of echolocation, for evolution to make the lion slightly better at catching zebra.

Once again, we have someone ignorant of evolution arguing that something should be easy, or comparably easier, to evolve to do something. What if lions simply became scavengers? Or waited to trap zebras? There's no goal to evolution, so whatever advantage outweighs the negatives wins out.

&gt; So the lions then eats all the zebra. All zebra are now gone. It can't catch the implala so then it starves. All lion are now gone. All we have are impala.

A very simplistic thought idea, but if the zebra can't reproduce enough to sustain their population, then yes, they will go extinct. But before this happens, there will be fewer lions to feast on them because there will be less food to feed the lions, if all they got to feast on were zebra. So there would be an equilibrium that would form before either were to be wiped out, and something else would need to affect one of their populations to push them over the edge to extinction.

&gt; The point of this is that it's very easy for minor changes to disrupt complex ecosystems and result in very simple ones.

Somehow this ""complex ecosystem"" consisting of one predator and two prey species collapses with a simple change, that is, lions overeating the only one of the two prey they could catch. That's not very complex and it's a bad argument to make.

Claim #2:

""Secondly, this [post] led me to consider DNA's error checking and repair mechanisms.""

Oh, boy... And the [post] does not link anywhere as of the time of posting this.

&gt; How is it, that evolution which depends on random mutations, would evolve mechanisms that try to prevent any mutations from occurring at all?

Because too many errors would be a huge issue for a system which requires replication? However, nothing is perfect, and for humans, even with billions of base pairs in a single genome, over 100 errors get through when forming gametes. Imagine if there was no system of correction how bad that would get?

&gt; The theory of evolution cannot exist without mutations driving change, so why and how would random mutations end up creating complex nanomachines that try to eliminate all mutations.

The ""why"" assumes there's a purpose to it rather than chemistry being chemistry. And just because something tries to do something doesn't mean it will always succeed at it. A working, replicating living cell would continue living if it kept replicating perfectly, as long as it did not need to adapt to any environment. But chemistry doesn't always work the exact way every time (due to external forces interacting with chemical reactions) so sometimes errors creep in. Now we have variations in those organisms. Some bad. Some good. Most do nothing toward the fitness of the organism.

&gt; This doesn't make sense to me.

Perhaps because you refuse to learn about evolution from reputable sources and keep insisting creationism must be true?",1,116,1578456248,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elncx1/rcreation_two_logical_issues_with_evolution_or/
DebateEvolution,elgd16,SpecialSpread4,,t2_58cg5qn1,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Mark Armitage of dinosaur soft tissue fame has claimed to have found soft axons in addition to soft vein valves in dinosaur fossils. What could explain his results?,"Mark Armitage has claimed he has found further evidence of the young age of dinosaur fossils.

&gt;Armitage starts showing several structures that he interprets as axons. Scientists who are committed to these fossils being millions of years old dismiss such structures as remnants of fungi that have contaminated the fossil. However, fungal remnants have specific characteristics, and Armitage does tests to show that the structures he interprets as axons don’t have those characteristics. Instead, they have the characteristics expected of axons! Indeed, he shows images from another scientist that demonstrate how axons from a mouse behave under specific conditions, and then he shows that one of the structures he interprets as an axon from a dinosaur behaves in a similar way.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most stunning image in the video is the one I show at the top of this article. The image shows what appears to be the sections of myelin that wrap an axon as well as the nodes of Ranvier that exist in between those sections. The arrows point out where the myelin wrappings end and the nodes of Ranvier begin. If these results are confirmed, they represent the first time anyone has isolated soft axons from a dinosaur fossil! Based on what I have seen, I think Armitage makes a very strong case, so I expect the results to be confirmed.

What could possibly explain this?

DebateEvolution,elfw8g,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"RE: Pseudogenes, this WILL come up, so let's get it out of the way now, because it doesn't say what creationists will claim it says.","New commentary in Nature.

(Don't get me started on Nature. Suffice it to say you should always double check work published there. But this isn't experimental work, it's a ""perspective"", so that caveat doesn't apply.)

&amp;nbsp;

If I were a betting man, I'd say that within a day or two, we're going to see a creationist post something along the lines of ""more biologists acknowledging creationist prediction of functional pseudogenes is accurate"", using this paper as proof.

And when that happens, invite said creationist to chill and read what those authors are saying. 

They are *not* saying ""junk DNA"" doesn't exist. 

They are *not* saying all, or even most, DNA is functional.

They are *not* saying pseudogenes (sequences derived from previously protein-coding regions that are no longer protein-coding) don't exist. 

&amp;nbsp;

They *are* saying that the term ""pseudogene"" is applied to broadly during genome annotation, without sufficient experimental support, and should be applied much more narrowly. Specifically, for regions derived from fully functional (i.e. transcribed, translated, and active) genes:

Retro-transposed coding regions and truncated coding regions, if translated, should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. (I think these should just be called ""genes"". That's the word for a transcribed and translated region of DNA. Pretty simple.)

Transcribed but non-translated regions should not be classified as pseudogenes by default, and should be evaluated on the basis of the activity of the resulting RNA - some have a regulatory function. (Although I think they go too far in the other direction here, and that non-translated RNAs should be in the ""maybe functional, maybe not"" box until each one is specifically checked experimentally.)

Non-transcribed regions that affect chromatin packaging should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. The authors describe how some may be involved in gene regulation via chromatin remodeling. (I think they also go a bit far here, and this affect on chromatin is basically incidental, and that the nearby genes have basically evolved around their genomic neighbors. So remove or modify the neighbors, and the regulation of the genes themselves are messed up. But that doesn't make the neighboring regions ""functional"".)

And finally, they describe two sets of things that can happen to pseudogenes which causes them to be associated with disease: recombination and copy-number variation. I think this is the weakest evidence for functions of the pseudogene regions. Basically, they aren't doing much until there is too much or it's in the wrong place. That's not showing they're functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I have my quibbles with some of what the authors say, but overall I think they make a reasonable point: The term ""pseudogene"" has been applied too widely, to most gene-derived sequences that don't do ""everything"" a gene does (and in some cases, to sequences that *do* do all of those thing, i.e. are genes in the traditional sense), even though at least some of these sequences are probably functional (i.e. contribute affirmatively to cell physiology). 

So be skeptical when you see creationists try to twist this paper to say something it doesn't. 

Or when they do, remind them that pseudogenes are about 1.2% of the human genome, so if *every single one* was functional, that would inch the needle up to about 11% functionality in the human genome. A far cry from ""at least 80% of the genome is functional"" or whatever insane number they use now.",1,7,1578423478,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elfw8g/re_pseudogenes_this_will_come_up_so_lets_get_it/

Just wanted to get thoughts on how a creationist might respond to those arguments and any criticisms or suggestions DE frequenters would have. 

Arguments:

We have very strong evidence for common descent in recent animals (microevolution acc. to many creationists). A portion of this evidence is weaker, but contributes to and is present among the whole of the evidence. This weaker evidence is present for extinct animals which may have much further removed proposed evolutionary relationships (macroevolution acc. to those same creationists). Our observations supported by strong evidence justify that this weaker evidence indicates evolution, while we have no evidence that it indicates anything creationist models propose. This counts in favor of evolution as the better explanation for all the weaker evidence we see. 

A wide variety of geological and physical processes we observe today are gradual processes that would take many thousands to millions of years to result in earth as we see today. If a young earth or a flood model were to account for these features, it would require a large number of significant coincidences to account for all of these processes at once. Our models which require fewer coincidences, all else equal, are better than models that require more. This counts in favor of old earth and non-flood models of geology as better than young earth and flood models of geology. 

Barimonology can only be a successful model of phylogeny for creationists if humans and primates are separate barims. Any methodology used to identify barims will: include expected and strongly evidenced clades, but include humans as primates; or separate humans and primates, but also separate expected and strongly evidenced clades as separate barims. There are no other successful models of phylogeny for creationists. For universal common descent, however, there are successful models of phylogeny. The best explanations for our observations, all else equal, will be successful models. This counts in favor of universal common descent as a better model of phylogeny than any creationist account. 

How might you expect a creationist respond to these? 

Any questions about the arguments? 

Any criticisms of the arguments? 

Any suggestions for the arguments?

Probably more important, what are some empirical sources I can use to verify some of the premises I'm defending?  It wouldn't be too hard to resort to waffling around the issues addressed if there are no hard obstacles presented.  In particular, I think examples of very clearly related animals alive today (elephants is an example I've seen before) would be very valuable for the explanation of weak evidence and problems with barimonology.  I especially need fossil evidence and the methodology used for recent evolutionary lines we have good accounts of, as this would allow comparison with more ancient evolution (although I expect this could be hard to find).",1,8,1578373530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/el6q33/developing_arguments_against_creation_model/

[This page (scroll down)](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions) by u/johnberea is an example. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9per4c/what_are_some_papers_you_can_site_showing_the/e87473w/) with u/br56u7, who is a YEC, is another. Thus John does a back-of-a-fag-packet calculation to conclude that if humans were created six million years ago, a diploid genome should have degraded from 100% to 88% functional.

A rather fun counter-argument to this is that plenty of intuitive ""kinds"" have a fantastically long existence in the fossil record without seeming to suffer any appreciable consequence of this phenomenon.

Crocodilians and Crocodyliformes have existed continuously since at least the late Cretaceous and early Jurassic, respectively. Take [this beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus) for instance.

Let’s give it 120 million years.

The relevant parametres are similar to those of humans. Neutral substitution rate of [7.9 x 10^(-9) per site per generation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386873/). Genome size of 2-3 gigabases. Generation time around 20 years. So extrapolating a 12% loss every 6 million years to 120 million years gives me 0.88^20=0.078 functional or a loss of 92.2% of the original function of the genome.

Unless I’m missing something, by u/johnberea’s calculations crocodiles are seriously fucked. Except that [they’re very much still around](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/45433088/3010181).

DebateEvolution,ek7oot,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"A question for the creationists, hopefully leading to nice chill discussion for a change.","I have a few questions for creationists about the life of plants and the great flood.  This is a question for creationists who believe in both the global flood, and micro evolution is the only form of evolution. This is clearly not trying to be too serious a conversation, yet I would like to take is seriously enough to avoid answering the questions by ‘magic’.


Before I ask the question, we have to agree on a few things:

1.	Flood waters would be brackish due to the salinity of the ocean. This would result in a large change to soil chemistry.


2.	Aquatic plants and terrestrial plants are of different kinds as they live in very different environments. Following this logic plants that can survive in saline rich vs non saline rich soil are different kinds. (As I’ve never read a concrete definition of a kind, these are the kinds for this conversation). 


3. To the best of my knowledge, terrestrial plants are unable to survive for 40 days under brackish water (this is a testable hypothesis, I’d love to be shown I’m wrong). Therefore, during the flood all of the terrestrial plants would have likely perished.

4. When the flood waters receded, soil chemistry would have been altered due to being covered with brackish (or straight saline water) water.

5. Aquatic plants didn’t recolonize the land, see point 2.



The Noah’s Ark story makes a big deal about Noah and his family gathering up two animals of every kind for the ark. I’ll admit I’m far from an expert on the story, but I’ve never heard of Noah et al. gathering up every kind of terrestrial (and some aquatic plants depends on the chemistry of the flood waters). But because I want to have good faith conversation I’ll be generous and extend an olive branch and allow Noah to have a massive seed stock of all of the plants on earth. With that said his seed stock would be useless due to changes in soil chemistry (Points 1 and 2).



So my questions are as follows. 

1. If God repopulated the earth with similar plants, (that were magically able to live in saline rich soil) where did our plants that live in non-saline rich soil come from?  

2. How did Noah’s small family desalinate the ground rapidly enough to feed not only themselves, but all of the animals on the Ark. What methods did they use to desalinate the grounds using the very limited technology available at the time, how did the cover the entire earth?  We should see a small break in the fossil record on remote areas of land and isolated regions.

3. If God magically pulled all of the salt out of the ground and repopulated the entire earth with plants, why did he require a 600 year old man undergo the arduous task of building an ark and gathering up the animals when he could have simply repopulating the earth with animals? Clearly God was interested in saving Noah, not the animals as he let nearly every animal die and there were no specific instructions about 'moral' animals.

Be kind to one another, as long as people are here in good faith be reasonable with your down votes.

DebateEvolution,eisps0,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Vivek_david_law says that I lied about Hells Creek being non-marine.,"I’m disappointed you didn’t tag me so I can defend my post vivek_david_law.

[You called me a liar](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eirg13/dishonesty_of_debateevolution_hells_creek_marine/) when I made the case that Hell Creek is a non-marine deposit.  I’m once again forced to return to the discussion. 

Excuse the large amounts of quotes. I’m letting the [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation) page and this [New Yorker]( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) article that Vivek linked to speak for themselves. I'm really not interested in revisiting this topic, but I won't stand idly by when called a liar.

I included links to both articles I’ve copied quotes from so you can ensure I’m not quote mining.

Vivek_david_law:

&gt;So what was found in hells creek? Was it animals from rivers with brackish waters overflowing. Well a quick glance at the hells creek Wikipedia page says that along with fish, they also found sharks, octopuses, sea turtles and marine retitles like the mosasaur. So quick question for r/debateevolution - do sea turtles live in rivers or do they live in the ocean? Do we expect sea turtles from flooding rivers with brackish waters - or would that be consistent with a flood?


Why go to the Wikipedia page when I cited my data from a peer reviewed paper?  But I’ll indulge you, here are some other quotes from the Wikipedia page.

&gt;[Hell’s Creek] is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited…

&gt;The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the Fort Peck area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat, forested floodplainwith a relatively subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to conifers such as the bald cypress, ferns and ginkgos. The Hell Creek Formation was laid down by streams, on a coastal plain along the edge of the Western Interior Seaway. The presence of crocodilia suggests climate was subtropical; there was no cold season and probably ample precipitation.

&gt;At the time, this region had a subtropical, warm and moist climate. The climate was humid, with flowering plants, conifers, palmettos, and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, canopy, understory plants, ash trees, live oak and shrubs in the forests. In northwestern South Dakota, strips of black layers deposited in the wetland environment are rich in coal, and a bright band-like layer of sand and mud from the river floodplain accumulated.

&gt;A broad coastal plain extended westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone which have been attributed to floodplain, fluvial, lacustrine, swamp, estuarine and coastal plainenvironments.


This is exactly what I said, there were forests, and river near an inland sea. Some how you missed all of this while reading the wiki article.

Next you cited an article in the New Yorker. In the interest of fairness I’ll only quote from sources you provided. 

&gt;At the time of the [Chicxulub impact event], the Hell Creek landscape consisted of steamy, subtropical lowlands and floodplains along the shores of an inland sea. The land teemed with life and the conditions were excellent for fossilization, with seasonal floods and meandering rivers that rapidly buried dead animals and plants.

&gt;One paleontologist estimated that in the Cretaceous period Hell Creek was so thick with T. rexes that they were like hyenas on the Serengeti. It was also home to triceratops and duckbills.

Last I checked T-Rexes are terrestrial dinosaurs. 

&gt;In 2004, DePalma, at the time a twenty-two-year-old paleontology undergraduate, began excavating a small site in the Hell Creek Formation. The site had once been a pond, and the deposit consisted of very thin layers of sediment. Normally, one geological layer might represent thousands or millions of years. But DePalma was able to show that each layer in the deposit had been laid down in a single big rainstorm. “We could see when there were buds on the trees,” he told me. “We could see when the cypresses were dropping their needles in the fall. We could experience this in real time.” 




You linked to the article to support the following argument:

&gt;I'm not the only one surprised by salt and freshwater species with land mammals being found at hells creek. While r/DebateEvolution pretends this is normal and unquestioned, here is a non-creation scientist saying that they are perplexed by the finding in the New Yorker


The New Yorker article explains your findings in the following paragraph:

&gt;“When I saw that, I knew this wasn’t just any flood deposit,” DePalma said. “We weren’t just near the KT boundary—this whole site is the KT boundary!” From surveying and mapping the layers, DePalma hypothesized that a massive inland surge of water flooded a river valley and filled the low-lying area where we now stood, perhaps as a result of the KT-impact tsunami, 


There are many more quotes I can take from the article that discuss a non-marine environment, but I think I’ve argued my case.

Finally you linked to an article that discusses a tsunami at the KT boundary. This was already discussed above so I see no need to expand on my argument. 

The Wikipedia page states that deposition of the Hells Creek Formation took 2 million years. This two million years included a tsunami caused by the Chicxulub impact event. This tsunami mixed up terrestrial and marine organism. 

That does NOT mean that is was a non-marine environment for long periods of time. The ample amount of non-marine fossils speak for themselves.",1,70,1577936318,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eisps0/vivek_david_law_says_that_i_lied_about_hells/

One of the biggest points of discussion is about the enforcement and minutiae of Rule One, so that the moderation team is more consistent in when and how that rule is used to encourage polite conversation, it is tough to hit a proper balance point, as folks who are being told that literally every bit of science is against them tend to get a bit testy and we don’t want to set up a double standard, but still sometimes the tone gets somewhat unproductive on our end as well.

DebateEvolution,eh4ytp,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"The issue isn't science it's philosophy! Okay, u/vivek_david_law, philosophise me this one.","&gt;What I realized from reading the posts, and from reading a lot of the posts on r/debateevolution is the problem for YEC is not a scientific conundrum. 

&gt;...

&gt;We don't even apply philosophy to basic philosophical questions, we think it's a waste of time.

&gt;This is a new modern development, and I think it's the source of this apparent science Young Earth conflict.

This is an amazing claim made on r/creation by u/vivek_david_law.

Unsurprisingly, the rest of his post is full of some quite extraordinary generalities (""often rejected by scientists"", that kind of thing), so let's get down to one very specific empirical case.

I'm going to return to u/denisova's chart, expanded with other measurements from the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary.

25 different analyses using three different isotopes with different halflives, from several locations and performed independently by several laboratories, wouldn't have been in agreement if there had been something fundamentally wrong with radiodating. If they were off by say, five orders of magnitude, as YECs believe. Of if, as you yourself said, we're (incorrectly) assuming ""that we know the way radioactive isotopes form and dissipate over long periods of time"".

This is a simple empirical test of the two theories, Old Earth vs Young Earth. The only assumption it makes is that a theory with predictive power (Old Earth: these methods should agree) is superior to a theory without predictive power (Young Earth: there is no intrinsic reason why these methods should agree).

So, u/vivek_david_law, if you think the empirical science isn't the issue and it's all about philosophy, **please give me a philosophical YEC interpretation of the same data.** I'm all ears.

I don't recall every seeing this before, so let's do it. I'm not going to comprehensively address each item, but I will group them thematically. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#1 is just 0_o...change in allele frequencies is the literal definition of evolution. We can observe this happening. Therefore evolution happens. There's a phrase: ""Microevolution"" is the evolution creationists can't deny, ""macroevolution"" is the evolution creationists must deny."" This is the former, so they go on to say ""but this isn't *really* evolution."" &lt;shruggie&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

\#2 is literally something I teach in the ""common misconceptions"" section of my 200-level evolution class.

&amp;nbsp;

\#3-5 and 7-11 are strawmen. Nobody says any of those things ""prove"" evolution. They are *examples* of evolutionary change, and *evidence* for evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#6 The scientific consensus *is* that evolution is true, but nobody says ""there's consensus, *therefore* evolution is true."" The causality goes the other way. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#12 and \#19-20 go together. Depending on how you make a design argument, it's either unfalsifiable, or false. ""Bad design"" doesn't really come into it, except to undermine some of the clumsily-stated falsifiable versions. It's often framed in religious, rather than scientific terms, and the modern, US-based ID movement, in addition to generally promoting an unfalsifiable idea of biological design, is an explicitly religious movement. Which has no bearing on the validity of the underlying idea, but turned out to be a liability in court. All of this is irrelevant to the validity of evolutionary theory, since disproving one idea does not automatically validate a competing idea. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#13: Biogeography *does* support evolution. It's *what led to evolutionary theory*. Both Darwin and Wallace were primarily engaged in biogeography, and Wallace is considered the father of the field.

&amp;nbsp;

\#14: Abiogenesis is a separate theory, and falling back to ""but evolution doesn't explain the origins of life!"" is a goal-post move. That being said, there's a robust and ever-growing body of evidence for abiogenesis, so biologists shouldn't shy away from the topic when it comes up. If creationists want to die on that hill instead of evolution, fine with me. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#15-18 are things nobody uses to defend evolutionary theory, and I'm reasonably confident these aren't real arguments scientists make. I'd be more confidence, but I can't read literally every argument anyone ever makes on these issues, so I can't be sure. I haven't personally encountered them. They range from unreasonable to laughable. Has the author of this piece ever, I don't know, *asked biologist what the arguments for evolution are*? Or are they just making things up?

&amp;nbsp;

\#21 is irrelevant to the question of the validity of evolutionary theory.

There was no denying they existed, but when they lived and how they died wasn’t important since God didn’t deem it necessary to put any information about them in his book. If I wanted to know what happened to them I could simply ask him when I arrived in heaven. I was taught nothing could have lived 65 million years ago because God created all land animals and man on the 6th day of creation. I remember being taught in the 3rd grade that the Earth and universe were both 6,000 years old. This timeline was established in 1650 CE by James Ussher, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh. He studied the Bible and tracked back the time and date of creation to be approximately 6 pm on October 22, 4004 BCE. In a small classroom in 1997 my young mind was being taught the same thing and I believed it. I had no reason to doubt it, after all, I was in school and this was an adult telling me this. I was never taught about the alternative theories. Anytime I would hear anything remotely contradicting the ""Young Earth"" belief I would do as I was told: ignore it. I had no reason to question this as truth because The Bible was truth and nothing in it could be false.

DebateEvolution,ee67bk,scherado,,t2_gsdvua3,self.DebateEvolution,,On the Importance of Debate Over Our Subject,"Alrighty then! My first post was ... a *success!*

On the subject of the theory of biological evolution (TOBE), an observation: there is much more *sane* debate over TOBE than ""climate change,"" formerly known as ""global warming"" (anthropogenic climate change); and those of us old-enough to have seen womens' pant hip-lines go from way down, to way-too-far up, ***then*** back down again--too far down, perhaps, if you have children or nieces--***we*** know that there was ***no*** debate over the ""coming ice age"" (early to mid-'70s).

&amp;nbsp;
You may want to re-read that sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;
I think the debate of TOBE is very [salubrious](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/salubrious). The essence of scientific inquiry is to establish a cause for a given affect.

&amp;nbsp;
When I use the phrase, ""present-day complex bodies,"" that is ***exactly*** the affect (result) that TOBE requires.  ***That's*** not negotiable. The only uncertainty is to the precise complexity. The contemporary discoveries about the human genome, for example, are a genuine examples of complexity. What's preposterous to me is that ""genetic mutation"", ***random or otherwise*** is the mechanism of change that explains the vast physical transformation from a simplistic organism into a present-day complex organism.

&amp;nbsp;

Enter, however, a lovely little thing called the historical record, which seriously fucks with this theory.

The fact that modern animals are frequently attested, as far as records go (which is pretty much right up to the Tower of Babel, about a century post-flood, if you’re a YEC), with *the physical and behavioral characteristics of modern animals*, is strong evidence against this YEC model.

This post gives some specific examples of where the historical and archaeological record further constrains already implausible YEC micro-evolution narrative. I’m putting it here for reference. It shows that creationists have, at best, a century or two to play with for many of the kinds they postulate.

(Note: creationists can’t agree on their own bullshit revisionist timelines, so I usually haven’t tried to translate real dates into YEC dates. But these would all have to be a matter of a few centuries at most.)

**Evidence for divergence of the cat kind**

All [one species on the ark](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/), around 2300 BCE. Yet we find, among many other things...

- An extremely clear picture of a lion from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, conventionally around 2550 BCE (figure 8 [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/artifacts-royal-cemetery-of-ur-171678)).

- Pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egyptian tombs containing remains of both wild cats and leopards. See [here](https://www.thegreatcat.org/cat-domestication-continued-the-mostagedda-tomb-hierakonpolis/), [here](https://archive.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html) and [here](http://www.hierakonpolis-online.org/index.php/explore-the-predynastic-cemeteries/hk6-elite-cemetery).

- A Proto-Sumerian (conventionally 3000 BCE) [depiction of a leopard](https://phoenixancientart.com/work-of-art/mesopotamian-statuette-of-a-leopard/)

So that’s a conventional 15.2 million years (lion/domestic cat on timetree.org) compressed into a few centuries max.

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the sheep kind**

- Ancient Sumerian texts from third millennium B.C.E. [distinguish between sheep and goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_between_sheep_and_grain).

- [Summary of early attestation of goats](https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/goats-in-the-ancient-near-east-and-their-relationship-with-the-mythology-fairytale-and-folklore-of-t).

- Extensive [archaeological evidence](https://www.academia.edu/2590017/Sheep-_and_-Goats-Mesopotamia-domestication-_and_-secondary-products) for sheep and goats, stretching deep into prehistory.

- The Proto-Indo-European lexemes for [sheep](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%82%C3%B3wis) and [goat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0u%C7%B5-) are reconstructible, requiring these animals to have existed when PIE was spoken. Creationists tend to assume PIE was spoken immediately after the Tower of Babel, which would give just over a century for the divergence.

Instead of 9.75 million years (sheep/goat on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for equid divergence **

- An 18th century BCE text distinguishing between [horse and mule](http://imh.org/exhibits/online/legacy-of-the-horse/riding-comes-near-east-1350-bce/).

- The notion of the donkey as stubborn (inaccurate, but the stereotype is based on actual behaviour traits of this equid which *differ* from horse traits) dates back at least to Sumerian [texts from 2100-1800 B.C.E.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/598273.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A63fea475e6409e83e7bb2eb0e5c5ceb4)

- Donkey remains from [early dynastic Egypt](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3715).

Particularly interesting is the fact that mules (horse-donkey hybrids) have been infertile since as far as our historical records go. Even where it is not otherwise stated it can be inferred from their market value, as outlined [here](https://books.google.be/books?id=vUIoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Sumerian+price+of+mule&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHWaex_zy1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CQj8yxR88OiaJjetrB-PapKOBLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZx86IlK_mAhWvxoUKHR90DQMQ6AEwDnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20price%20of%20mule&amp;f=false); the fact that mules were so expensive is reflective of the fact that they could not simply be bred.

This is further significant in that deliberately breeding hybrids suggests some experience in equid domestication. By any reasonable scenario, therefore, this pushes horse-onager and horse-donkey divergence even further back. We're presumably playing with decades here. Instead of a conventional 7.7 million years (horse/donkey on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the eagle kind**.

[“Includes hawks, but also kites, harriers, eagles, and Old World vultures.”]( https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-of-avian-ark-kinds/)

- Ancient Sumerians [depicted the eagle](https://books.google.be/books?id=aH-Aq6oF5uoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=eagle+sumeria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xLon2oQ9Gq&amp;sig=ACfU3U1P398gVF7eefpMvqx1Qbk_4wey7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8nc-LnK_mAhXCxYUKHXKlDNMQ6AEwFnoECA4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eagle%20sumeria&amp;f=false).

- The identification of black kites from the [Egyptian fifth dynasty](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40345840?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) is based on their behaviour as well as their appearance.

- Extremely clear depiction of the [Egyptian vulture from 2600 BCE](https://www.lifegyptianvulture.it/en/the-egyptian-vulture/).

That makes, again, a few centuries max instead of conventional 31 million years (eagle/kite on timetree.org). 

-----

On a side note, I must say I never realised just *how* brazenly amateurish baraminology was:

&gt;When hybrid data is lacking, a cognitum approach is preferred; this identifies natural groupings based on human cognitive senses

So a smart creationist might try to rescue the creationist view by saying they’ve just messed up the kinds and those kinds are actually multiple kinds.

But then again, on the flip side of the coin, you have to fit all these animals onto a wooden ship that’s already too big to be seaworthy as described in the Bible.

&gt; I see neither any scientific nor compelling other reasons to dispute the conventional dating of the age of the universe and Earth, or the conventional explanations for the origin of the geological column and the fossil record. I also consider so-called Flood Geology of Young Earth Creationists as a totally failed endeavor.

https://www.bechly.at/anti-darwinism-1/

Michael Behe

&gt; Although in Darwin’s Black Box, Behe confessed that he had “no reason to doubt that the universe is billions of years old,” and that he had “no particular reason to doubt” common descent (p. 5), such comments were few and far between. Some Bible-believing scientists, trying to give Behe the benefit of the doubt, speculated that, perhaps such “brief, sporadic comments...were intended to make the book more marketable” (see Major, 1996). (It was, after all, made available by a major publishing company—Simon &amp; Schuster.) What’s more, “Behe’s arguments stand without any reference to the age issue” (Major).

&gt; Christians have much less about which to be excited in Behe’s latest book, The Edge of Evolution. Sadly, it is riddled with unscriptural, unprovable, even irreverent statements. First, Behe repeatedly gives credence to the evolutionary geologic timetable. He writes about fish that he believes have been around for “ten million years” (2007, p. 16), and how “perhaps a trillion creatures have preceded us [humans—EL] in the past ten million years” (p. 60). Behe even goes so far as to suggest that life has been on Earth for “the past several billion years” (p. 19). The fact is, Behe’s thoughts contradict holy writ: God created “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” in six days (Exodus 20:11)—thousands, not billions, of years ago (cf. Mark 10:6; Luke 11:49-51; Romans 1:20; see also Lyons, 2006).

Any thoughts? 

&gt; This analysis of de novo origination in the genus Oryza detected critical evidence in both ancestral non-coding origination and 
translational products of de novo genes. We identified at least 175 candidate de novo genes with significantly similar ancestral non-coding sequences, implicating an unexpectedly high rate 
(51.5 de novo genes per Myr) of generation and retention of de novo genes in the genomes of young Oryza species compared with reported lower numbers of de novo genes in metazoans1,2,16–29 and 
plants12–15. These observations show that de novo genes are important in the evolution of protein diversity in Oryza. These data reveal the power of evolution in natural populations in the generation 
of de novo genes that arise from non-coding sequences, probably via various possible molecular processes over time54,68, compared with artificial synthesis and selection69,70. We also note that the observed high rate of de novo gene generation and retention in the recent evolution of Oryza might have been in equilibrium with the loss of unrelated genes in genome evolution, as was previously detected in cereal species33. We anticipate that, whether or not such dynamics of gene evolution can be extrapolated beyond the Oryza genus backwards to farther ancestral lineages of Poaceae, monocots and angiosperms will be an important problem to explore in the future.

It's so weird how creationists keep harping on Haeckel's fraudulent embryos as if it presents a formidable challenge to the theory of evolution. Please, enough. Every single biologist worth their weight in salt recognizes this fraud. Even if ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" was a hypothesis worth investigating, Haeckel forged many of his drawings.

Research on embryology into the early twentieth century delved deeper into development, and the boom of molecular biology was so loud that many textbooks just didn't remove this flaw (i.e. Homeobox genes, ""hedgehog"" genes, etc.). But the fact that it is wrong does not discount the interpretation of embryological development through the lens of evolutionary history.

Human embryos have pharyngeal gill slits (like all **chordates**\--cladistic term--have at some point in their life cycle). Duh. That's telling of human evolutionary history. But the theory doesn't always hold. There is no bacterial stage in the development of the zygote. There. An ""evolutionist"" has admitted that ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny. Done.

And of course, /u/PaulDouglasPrice lies through his teeth.

&gt;So this is more or less a question for anybody who happens to work in (or is familiar with) the field of genetics in any capacity:

Then don't try a closed creationist subreddit.

&gt;Are you aware of any discussion going on behind the scenes about genetic entropy? Is there any frank discussion going on, say, in population genetics, for example, about how all the published models of mutation effects predict decline? That there is no biologically realistic simulation or model that would actually predict an overall increase in fitness over time?

None of this is true.

&gt;What about the fact that John Sanford helped create the most biologically-realistic model of evolution ever, Mendel's Accountant? And of course, this program shows clearly that decline happens over time when you put in the realistic parameters of life.

Mendel's Accountant is frighteningly flawed, but of course, PDP is completely unqualified to recognize that.

Did you know that there are *no* values that you can put into Mendel's Accountant which is stable? You can make positive mutations exceedingly common and the population's fitness still collapses.

This suggests something is **very wrong** with his simulation.

&gt;Darwinian evolution is fundamentally broken at the genetic level. The math obviously doesn't work, so how do the researchers manage to keep a straight face while still paying lip service to Darwin?

Because saying it is a lot different than proving it, you still have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;According to Sanford's own testimony on the matter, his findings have been met with nothing but silence from the genetics community (a community of which Sanford himself is an illustrious member, having achieved high honors and distinguished himself as an inventor). He believes they are actively attempting to avoid this issue entirely because they know it is so problematic for them.

Yes, because Sanford is completely discredited. His entire theory is nonsense.",1,98,1576518433,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ebif5i/pdp_asks_unqualified_laymen_is_genetic_entropy/

Creationist horse manure strikes once again. /u/nomenmeum posted [this]( https://www.thebereancall.org/content/marine-fossils-mixed-hell-creek-dinosaurs) steaming pile of lies at /r/creation. 

There are two lies that I want to discuss. 

First:
&gt;Hell Creek itself is claimed to be terrestrial solely because it contains dinosaur fossils. But it’s filled with marine fossils from top to bottom.

Second:
&gt;Spinosaurus, the largest theropod dinosaur ever discovered, was found in Morocco with car-size fossils of coelacanth fish, which today are only found in the deep ocean.

We’ll tackle the lies in reveres order.

First the Spinosaurus in the paper cited by the creationist ‘journal’ states:

&gt;These adaptations suggest that Spinosaurus was primarily a piscivore, subsisting on sharks, sawfish, coelacanths, lungfish, and actinopterygians that were common in the Kem Kem river system.

I’m not a geographer, but last I checked rivers are non-marine.

Secondly, on the 23rd of December 1938, Captain Hendrick Goosen caught a species of Coelacanth in the [Tyolomnqa river]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth#cite_note-Smith-6) in South Africa. 

So we have the implication of a lie, followed by an outright lie.


Now to the true heart of the matter, Hells Creek Formation (HCF).

There is a lot of evidence that large areas of HCF was non-marine for a long period of time, so I’m going to list of 6 pieces of evidence followed by a brief discussion. All of my evidence comes from ‘Lithostratigraphy of the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota’ by Edward C. Murphy, John W. Hoganson, and Kirk R. Johnson. The paper was originally published in Geological Society of America in 2002. You can access it yourself at DOI: 10.1130/0-8137-2361-2.9.

1.	Paleosols have been found in HCF, these of fossilized soil horizons.  Soil takes long periods to form.

2.	Fossilized pine cones and many other varieties of plants and roots have been been found in the HCF.

3.	Rivers that have flooded their banks are present in the geological record of the HCF.

4.	‘Fossilized Popcorn weathering’ that is weather than occurs when clays water content changes, most commonly found today in the badlands. 

5.	Fresh water mollusks, and many other non-marine fossils (including dinosaurs) have been found in HCF.

6.	Coal deposits are present. 

I think that list shows that there were long periods time were the HCF was non-marine. If you have any question about any of pieces of evidence please ask. Due to the proximity of the Western Interior seaway, parts of the HCF were brackish and there are layers of marine sediment, but that doesn’t mean that dinosaurs swam out to see and drowned. It simply means sea level was changing. There is ample evidence to support a non-marine ecosystems existed during the HCF epoch. The creationists even agree agrees with my findings:

&gt;The data show multiple examples of mixed land, freshwater, and marine influences in the upper HCF. These results mesh well with the marine influence found in North Dakota.


You’ll note that the authors stop just short of using this as evidence for the Noachian flood, they strongly implied it stating that the finding of marine fossils didn’t surprise ~~flood geologists~~ creationists. Yet there is abundant evidence free for anyone to check out that simply proves that a single flooding even did not occur (at least during the same time period as the deposition of HCF, nor any other time, but this is only evidence for this time).


To those of you in /r/creation who are upset that once again, a lurker from /r/debateevolution is create their own parallel post and vent their hatred and scoffing [at /r/debateevolution]. I have a simple one step solution. You should have no problems following it, it’s one of your (for the Christians at least) 10 commandments.

STOP TELLING LIES.

One of the reasons I fell in love with geology is you can do a lot of it for nearly free. Getting to the study area is generally the hardest part. Any one of us can travel to HCF and see the paleosols, see the fossilized popcorn weathering, and the pine cones and other plant matter. It’s all there for anyone to see. 

Posts with lies like these are toxic, we literally owe our modern lifestyle to science, and you hand wave it away. Remember next time you need antibiotics, or eat a vegetable, or fill your car with gas, many years of science has been done in the background so you can do those things. These are the same fields that have contributed to the theory of evolution. You man not believe evolution is real, but you are quick to reap the material rewards of the same fields of science. 

Stop living in the past, and most importantly, STOP TELLING LIES and I guarantee we’ll stop ~~creating [our] own parallel posts and vent [our] hatred and scoffing~~ calling you out for your bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the flaw in basic thinking is that you assume that what you see as a red shift demonstrates ""Evidence"" for a bing bang therefore in your puny minds bing bang happened ergo evolution.

How do you know that what you call the unvierse isnt just a SINGLE atom or cell in a much HIGHER dimension that we couldnt even begin to see or imagine.

How could you observe that your just living in a SINGLE cell that is called the Universe?

We are so puny we could NEVER know this, not to mention, just like time or speed is considered relative, so is size. Size is relative as well. We dont know whether or not our universe isnt just a SINGLE atom or Cell that is just as random as the atoms in our observable universe and that it gets its randomness by the randomness of the atoms in our universe that combines into the randomness of the atom which is called our observable universe.

&amp;#x200B;

When you take these things into account, it becomes difficult to accept evolotion because evolution becomes yet another fallacy in logic that humans who know NOTHING about life and existence tend to make. I would wager millions of dollars that the MAJORITY of people who believe in evolution do so simply JUST to avoid the ridicule that EVERYONE tends to get when they dispute the theory. Name one person that DOESNT get insults and hate for trying to go against this theory. It truly is so carefully protected and just watch how everyone that posts here will go off with the insults or the nonsense just because they HATE when somoene goes against their theory. THey use the fallacy of logic saying that ""majority of scientists believe it ergo its true"" when its NOT. No one can explain what our Universe is at all, so if you dont know what the universe is, how could you explain its origin or the origin of life?

Im not here trying to say that based on what I say, the only truth must be Creation. My point is, no one can know, so lets instead spend time on ACTUAL REAL science that can be observed and ALWAYS tested in a lab with 100% success rate which is what REAL SCIENCE is. Dont give me your opinions on how we got here based on some flimsy evidence and your desperate attempt to deduce how things happened.   


The moron who before evolution or even Darwin, aka Charles Lyell, came up with the geologic column and applied his own arbitrary dates to layers of rock before any form of radiometric dating existed, and people took his word and believed it with NO PROOF or any EVIDENCE, why? simply because at that time the climate was such that people didnt want a King and especially didnt want God. The fallacy humans make today is to think they are Gods, they are all knowing, and they dont need a God and can do everything themselves, so they will believe whatever they want to just so they can have some way or reason or excuse to disregard a creator.

&amp;#x200B;

Again Im not for creation nor evolution. I simply live my life. I came here on an alt account because on my main account I noticed that after like 6 months of not posting here, someone apparently mentioned my name in this subreddit, and I was banned because I was just too difficult for the evolutionists to try and disprove. Honestly all I ever got was insults and hate because thats all evolutionists can do, come only online as in real life they are cowards and cant talk all bold as they do online, they group together, and think ""yes I can insult him and all my evolutionists small brained morons will also defend me, and then they will ban him on top of it for some flimsy reason even though we are the ones cursing him out""

&amp;#x200B;

So yea guys, dont miss my point please as you all tend to do. My point is, you can NEVER know or Observe directly what we are and why or how we got here, so just enjoy life and stop wasting your time and life on this ridiculous theory. Focus on real science like chemistry or physics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, for all you know, the Universe is a computer simulation and it could have been made 20,000 years ago and how would you know. Matter of fact, the universe IS a simulation. We have particles and randomness. Our universe just tends more towards randomness which is why we are the way we are and have some sort of free will, whereas computers dont as they are only able to process information directly with no randomness. Even when a computer does generate random numbers it does it via a direct algorithm, and theres nothing random about it. Somoene will maybe say im wrong here i dont know how computers work but watch as someone says I am wrong about how computers do RNG therefore everything else is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets just reach a common ground. Lets just say neither evolution or creation can be proven true nor even with evidence, should we say that its one or the other. Thats the MOST IMPORTANT thing because then we could live and exist and talk in peace.

2. Gene Creation!  Increasing complexity and trait creation is assumed and believed, with no evidence that this can, or did, happen.
3. A Creator is religion! Atheism is science!  This propaganda meme is repeated constantly to give the illusion that only atheistic naturalism is capable of examination of data that suggests possible origins.
4. Abiogenesis. Life began, billions of years ago,  then evolved to what we see today.  But just as there is no evidence for spontaneous generation of life, so there is no evidence of universal common ancestry. Both are religious opinions. 
5. Mutation!  This is the Great White Hope, that the theory of common ancestry rides on.  Random mutations have produced all the variety and complexity we see today, beginning with a single cell.

What does man's best friend have to say about universal common descent?

I read the following study several years ago, and found a wealth of information about canidae.. many old beliefs or assumptions have been corrected by hard genetic evidence. It has interesting facts about dogs, &amp; their genetic base.

http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/8/990.full

This is a study by evolutionists, with the assumptions of evolution dispersed throughout. They even quote Darwin. Here is a summary of some of the points, with quotes from the study :

1. The ancestor of wolves, coyotes, dogs, and other canidae is unknown, appears suddenly, and contained all the genetic information for each haplotype. ""the origin of the huge morphological diversity that led Darwin to his speculation remains largely unknown""
2. All of the current variety of dogs are recent developments, less than 200 yrs old. ""Recent studies show that the origin of most dog breeds may derive from very recent selective breeding practices and are probably &lt;200 yr old""
3. Selection acts on EXISTING variability. It is not created on the fly, &amp; is assumed to take thousands or millions of years to come about. ""selection acts upon existing variability""
4. ALL of this variability EXISTED in the ancestral wolf/parent, according to the time frame in the CA (common  ancestry) model. ""It is remarkable that the potential for such large diversification existed in the ancestral wolf population""
5. The recent time for the variety of dog breeds is incongruent with the assumption of 'millions' or even thousands of years of evolution, to generate such variety. ""Furthermore, the time since domestication seems insufficient to generate substantial additional genetic diversity.""

The child branches within canidae show REDUCING variability, as the diverse genetic information became localized in the various clades/haplogroups.

The mtDNA provides clear evidence of the descendancy within canidae, but the time frame is incompatible with the CA model.


From the link:
""Phylogenetic tree of wolf (W), dog (D), and coyote (C) mtDNA sequences. The tree was constructed using a Bayesian approach. The same topology was obtained with a neighbor-joining approach. Support is indicated at the nodes as percent bootstrap support for 1000 neighbor-joining replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Four clades of dog sequences (I to IV) are indicated as in Vilà et al. (1997). Internal dog branches are marked in orange, and internal wolf branches are marked in light blue. The branch leading to wolf haplotype W1 was basal to the rest of the tree and it was also considered internal. Internal branches that could not be conclusively associated to dogs or to wolves are indicated in discontinuous green.""

As you can see, the mtDNA shows the ancestry line. The canid ancestor preceded the wolf, the dog, &amp; the coyote, as well as other canidae not listed. I have seen them in other genetic studies. But all this does is PROVE descendancy, and shows the variability to be INHERENT in the genes. It was not created on the fly, or mutated over millions of years.

Canidae shows diversity and adaptability. There is no evidence they shared ancestry with felids, equids, or any other haplotype. We can follow the MICRO variations within canidae, but there is NOTHING to suggest they were once of a different genetic structure. Canids have always been canids, and always produce canids, though with reduced variability, as we reach the ends of the branches in their haplotree.

I welcome any rebuttal, alternate conclusions, or additions to this study on canidae.",1,69,1575471728,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e60gmq/common_ancestry_canidae/

DebateEvolution,e5hkxc,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.DebateEvolution,,Problems with Common Ancestry: MRCA,"
I propose an examination of the evidence, (and the problems), for the theory of universal common ancestry, aka, macro evolution. 

This thread is about mitochondrial DNA, and the discovery some years back, of a 'marker', that was passed down to daughters, tracing actual descent. It leads to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA), in genetic lines, and provides hard science for timelines, descent, and relationships.

From wiki:
In human genetics, the Mitochondrial Eve (also mt-Eve, mt-MRCA) is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans, i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.

It is a problem for the theory of common descent, as it clearly shows the lines of descent in a particular genetic haplogroup.

For example, we can trace the descendancy in canids.. dogs, wolves, coyotes.. even though they are different morphologically, they show evidence of descent, and share a common mother.. the Most Recent Common Ancestor that they ALL descended from.

This marker does not cross over to other speculated ancestors. Humans, for example, share a common MRCA, which shows we all descended from the same mother, and did not evolve seperately, in different geological regions, as was once proposed. Neanderthals were human. Pygmies, Mongols, Eskimos, Europeans, Africans.. every race, region and body type of human beings all share the MRCA.. a marker showing descendancy and relationship with all other humans. Chimps, monkeys, apes, or any other speculated 'cousins', do not have this MRCA marker, but their own, showing THEIR  line of descent.

So, while the dingo, dog, wolf and coyote can be traced to a MRCA, humans, apes, and monkeys cannot. Each has its own MRCA, and they do not intersect or overlap. There is no evidence of descent.

From wiki:
""Mitochondrial DNA is the small circular chromosome found inside mitochondria. These organelles found in cells have often been called the powerhouse of the cell. The mitochondria, and thus mitochondrial DNA, are passed almost exclusively from mother to offspring through the egg cell.
...
Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by electron microscopy as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria, and by Ellen Haslbrunner, Hans Tuppy and Gottfried Schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.""


TMRCA:

Time to most recent common ancestor, aka 'mitochondrial clock'.

Source:
News this Week | Science

""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate.
For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new
clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old.
...
The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..""

..aka, circular reasoning.. you presume the descendancy of apes and humans, THEN calculate a 'rate!'. It is convenient if the data fits within (and is based upon) the preconceived assumptions.

""The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were “stunned” to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled..""

So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the belief.",1,249,1575382017,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e5hkxc/problems_with_common_ancestry_mrca/
DebateEvolution,e57ran,Rayalot72,Philosophy Nerd,t2_ofntq,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Philosophical Problems With Intelligent Design Arguments,"I wanted to take a moment to argue against Meyer's intelligent design arguments.  I see these everywhere in creationist circles, and think they receive too much credit.  While I think the objections by the more scientifically minded are good, those tend to be more technical, involving problems with the numbers and equations.  As a result, they're much less accessible, and are often ignored and not shared around.  My hope is to provide a more direct critique of what the argument is trying to do, which should be much more marketable and difficult for creationists to avoid.  The numbers can be granted, and the argument would still fail.  I also believe this can be done while granting most of Meyer's ideas.  

These objections should work for both the evolutionary intelligent design argument and the abiogenesis intelligent design argument, but I will focus on the abiogenesis version since it's more compelling as an argument for design, and more commonly used by creationists.  I will focus on two subjects, and have multiple sections for approaches to each.  I will also argue against a version with a very strong conclusion as the main objective of the post, and then relate those objections to weaker versions in a third section afterwards.  

#Designers:

Depending on the variation of the argument, the goal is to conclude that life is or is probably, at some stage, designed, and, therefore, there is a designer.  However, if we ask who or what the designer is, and how we know that, this conclusion turns out to be very hard to reach.  

Most important for this section is going to be cosmological principles.  Infinite regression creates a lot of philosophical problems when used as an ultimate explanation.  Some may not be possible, while others require explanations themselves.  For this reason, some final explanation must serve as the termination point (which I will refer to as ""ultimate explanation"").  This is used in the context of intelligent design to defend that design is the superior explanation, as it can act as the start of the chain, while naturalistic explanations themselves need to be explained.  This sort of designer is unlike any other designer we see day to day, and very similar to God.  A pretty strong conclusion.  Obviously, I will defend that this doesn't work out.  

**We Ought to Kick the can:**

So, let's consider what we can know about the designer.  We observe design regularly, and this is what Meyer uses to establish that design is able to explain abiogenesis.  The two designers we observe are biological, such as humans and other primates, and designed, such as computers and machines that can assemble other things.  

This creates an inductive problem for this strong notion of intelligent design.  All designed designers can be traced back to us, and we are biological entities.  This means all designers we observe are these natural beings, so we can know inductively that all designers probably have explanations.  This prevents designers from being valid termination points, as we are justified in believing they will all either be designed or themselves or biological in nature.  Design is just as good of an explanation as any other naturalistic explanation because we'll need to go one step further either way.  Even worse, we have reason to think there were no biological designers early in the universe, so we *must* have an explanation for at least some biological designers that does not involve design, and this explanation will likely apply to us as well.  

What if we already know God exists?  This would provide an interesting defense of intelligent design for *Christians and other theists*, since they can avoid the induction, but this will not matter for anyone starting from other positions.  I will also give reasons for why God is still not a better explanation in the next section.  

**Misuse of Cosmological Termination:**

What is the explanation for the movement of planets in our solar system?  Well, this is explained by the bending of space-time, the mass of the planets and the sun, their velocities, etc., and there are explanations as to how the masses and velocities got to be as they are, etc., until we eventually arrive at some ultimate explanation that is either necessary or brute.  

In the above example, we can see that our explanations interact with one another in a chain to get to a termination point, making any explanation along this chain a good explanation.  The cosmological principle described at the start of this subject is quite strange, then, as it aims to differentiate between designers and most naturalistic explanations in terms of their relation to ultimate explanations.  Since any naturalistic explanation provided can be explained by very ordinary natural facts (chemicals, physics, thermodynamics, etc.) which we know have ultimate explanations down the line, they don't truly violate our cosmological principles, so we don't need any special entities, such as ultimate designers, to serve as corrections.  We need not kick the can after all.  

Theists cannot appeal to God as a best explanation in this case, since He is just as viable as an ultimate explanation as any other fact God explains, which includes natural facts.  Some further argument is required to differentiate those explanations such that God is better for other reasons, which will be dealt with in the second subject.  

#Irreducibility:

The second facet of intelligent design arguments is the notion that biological complexity is irreducible.  It could not reasonably be caused by undirected processes, and design is the only or best example of a directed process we have.  

Most numbers-related objections are directed at this component of the intelligent design argument.  As stated in the introduction, I will not talk about these, but I believe I can poke some interesting holes in it anyway.  

**More can Kicking:**

In requiring a ""directed process,"" this could really be any source of complexity, information, etc. that exists prior to life, whether it's a designer, life (panspermia), or something else.  This creates a new problem where all the sources of these phenomenon we observe are natural, and the inductive argument described for first subject can be repeated in these broader terms to conclude natural complexity, information, etc.  

**The Epistemic Problem of Irreducibility:**

How can you know that something is irreducible?  Well, a few arguments for irreducibility exist in other areas, and they are fairly successful.  I will cover three different approaches, the third of which is most applicable to how intelligent design arguments are presented, but the other two are good analogies for similar arguments in creationist circles.  

The open question argument/naturalistic fallacy defends that moral properties can't be reducible to any other properties, like natural properties, since they'd be analytically equivalent, yet we don't treat them as definitionally the same (this argument is quite widely rejected, but for reasons unrelated to irreducibility).  So, we may be able to deduce irreducibility, but no facts in science seem to entail that complexity, information, etc., could not arise by undirected processes.  It can only be argued to be improbable, or not known to occur, so irreducibility is not guarenteed.  Some intelligent design arguments of this sort do exist, the argument that biology violates the second law of thermodynamics is a good example, but these are unsound, to put it lightly (they grossly misunderstand physics and other disciplines).  

The triviality objection is a similar argument which defends that, if moral properties are reducible to other properties, such as natural properties, then it would be trivial to show that they are the same.  This is a different approach that appeals to a straightforward reducibility that we ought to be able to do, but can't.  In this case, the nature of science makes this sort of objection inapplicable to abiogenesis.  Many scientific discoveries are quite non-trivial, and take time to find.  If abiogenesis occurred by natural processes, we couldn't expect to know how it happened regardless of how long research has been ongoing.  The claims that abiogenesis research has taken too long or that we have no naturalistic explanation right now, when used to defend creationism, are examples of arguments from triviality, and fail due to vague or indefensible assertions about what state abiogenesis research ought to be in.  

Arguments for dualism and against physicalism in the philosophy of mind are the closest to Meyer's original intelligent design arguments.  In the former case, the irreducibility of the mind is presented as the best account of mental phenomenon, evading the problems physicalism has with emergentism, qualia, and the difficulty of complete reduction.  For the latter, the improbability of the complexity, information, etc. is used to defend its probable irreducibility to undirected mechanisms as the best explanation of that phenomenon.  This makes many of the same mistakes as the triviality approach to the irreducibility of life.  Just because those numbers that result in such bad odds are accurate now (again, his numbers are quite questionable, I'm merely granting them for sake of argument) doesn't mean they will not change once research has progressed.  We me also discover alternative processes and structures which gave rise to life which require completely different calculations.  The true conclusion is that life is not reducible *to the structures we know of as we know them now*.  We also have very little information on abiogenesis, as we weren't there, have little to no fossils from that time, and only have the earth as an example of a life-bearing planet.  This provides very good reason to think we wouldn't be able to figure out how abiogenesis occured if it did.  

For the abduction to irreducibility, I should also point out that all of the objections raised for the first subject are damning to it.  Its dependence on probability means that a designer that can explain it mustn't be improbable, but those counter-arguments demonstrate just that.  A weaker objection that accomplishes the same goal would be referencing to the rarity of design in nature to suggest it's not actually a very good explanation, and, thus, harder to abduct to.  This may require first establishing that evolution is free of design, so that there is a good set of examples natural and undirected complexity, information, etc.

**Disparity in Progress:**

Over time, we've come up with more detailed accounts of how life may have started with abiogenesis.  We seem to be moving, for the time being, towards undirected natural processes.  Design, on the other hand, isn't something we've found much evidence for, and we may not even be able to find evidence of it if it did occur.  

While unverifiable and unfalsifiable explanations have become more acceptable in science, they are still very hard to defend as the best explanations of phenomenon.  Much more is needed than we have now to defend that inference, which puts irreducibility at a significant disadvantage to begin with.  

#Weaker Intelligent Design Arguments:

A lot of variations of Meyer's argument are much less useful to creationists but definitely easier to defend.  While I'm much less bothered by these, I also don't think they truly avoid the problems I describe for the first two subjects.  

**Abduction to Inclusive Intelligent Design:**

As pointed out for the first subject, natural designers would be the most likely designers, and would still terminate at some other explanation.  They cannot be much better explanations than just abiogenesis.  

Other sources of complexity, information, etc. are just as viable explanations as, if not better than, designers.  Panspermia in particular is a very good alternative candidate, since it fulfills all of the same purposes.  

Design may not actually be very probable for the reasons provided for the second subject.  If they were natural designers, we should have an even greater expectation of evidence that they exist, which, despite what UFO enthusiasts might say, we don't have.  Ayys are probably not responsible.  

**Intelligent Design as a Scientific Postulate:**

This is an argument I'm willing to concede, with caveats.  

For the reasons provided in the first subject, only natural designers are likely, so the notion that life was seeded by extratarrestrials is the only design postulate that works.  

This could be different if starting from theism, but science operates as if there are no non-natural facts (or at least, it won't draw conclusions about them), so God or designers as ultimate explanations are excluded.  

This conclusion is quite trivial, I seriously doubt much of anyone leaning on the side of abiogenesis entirely excluded this as a possibility.  It's definitely not what creationists are looking for, and it doesn't seem as if Meyer is aiming for *merely* this conclusion either.",1,15,1575329917,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e57ran/philosophical_problems_with_intelligent_design/

&gt;In the world of myth, miracles are commonplace and occur regularly. Much the same could be said of evolutionary myths of origins. Just like in the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories and the Wolverine stories from the First Nations of North America, in the evolutionary origins myth one regularly encounters phenomena that are contrary to natural law and which have never been observed by any human. And the first of these miracles is abiogenesis, the transition from inert matter to living organisms, capable of reproducing themselves. But that is just the beginning. From there we go on to the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, then there’s the transition from marine organisms, such as fish, to terrestrial organisms, the transition from reptiles to mammals, the transition from land mammals to marine mammals and then the transition from crawling reptiles to flying birds. But the greatest miracle of all? This is undoubtedly the appearance of functional genetic code and its chemical basis, DNA, and all this without the intervention of a Programmer. It is clear that miracles abound in the evolutionary origins myth. The faith of evolutionary believers is great, but for my part I have to admit lacking enough faith to believe in such miracles

https://thenaturalhistorian.com/2019/11/11/the-lake-malawi-sediment-chronometer-and-thetoba-super-eruption/

Using C14 dating on the sediment below the lake floor, scientists were able to work out a deposition rate of 0.03 - 0.04cm per year for much of the lake's history.

The Toba Supereruption dating estimate was about 75000 years ago based on 40Ar/39Ar, 230Th/234U, ice core and spaleotherm dating methods

https://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/E3047


Now, C14 dating is only accurate to 50 000 years, so thr sedimentation rate was used to estimate the depth at which the Toba Supereruption should be - 75 000years * 0.03-0.04cm/year =&gt; that is, 24-30m down. 

And indeed, the Toba ash layer was found as predicted 28m down.

DebateEvolution,dwne76,witchdoc86,Professional Vampire,t2_ccp95,self.DebateEvolution,,SN1987A and the Age of the Universe,"There is one supernova in history that has allowed us to calculate its distance from us - INDEPENDENT of the speed of light in terms of light years, using simple trigonometry. It is SN1987A. 

&gt; After the progenitor star Sk-69 202 exploded, astronomers measured the time it took for the energy to travel from the star to the primary ring that is around the star. From this, we can determined the actual radius of the ring from the star. Second, we already knew the angular size of the ring against the sky (as measured through telescopes, and measured most precisely with the Hubble Space Telescope).

&gt; So to carry out the calculation think of a right triangle as indicated in the diagram below.

&gt; The line from SN1987A to earth (distance) is the base.
A line from SN1987A to the ring (the radius of the ring) is the height.
The line from the ring to earth is the hypotenuse.
The angle between the base and the hypotenuse is half the angular size of the ring
trig formula: base = radius ÷ tan(angle)


&gt; Substituting:

&gt; radius = 6.23 x 1012 km (see note 1 below) = 0.658 light-years
angle = 0.808 arcseconds (see note 1 below) = 0.000224 degrees
distance = 0.658 ly ÷ tan(0.000224)
distance = 0.658 ly ÷ 0.00000392
distance = 168,000 light-years
Note that taking the measurement error limits into account makes this value 168,000 light-years ± 3.5%.

&gt; For reference:
    c (lightspeed) = 299,792.5 kilometers per second
    1 arcsecond = 1/3600°
    1 parsec = 3.26 light-years
    1 light-year ~ 9.46 x 1012 km
    1 light-year ~ 5.88 x 10^12 miles

&gt;""What a curious argument Dawkins gives regarding the ""poor design"" of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Is he not aware that the nerve does more than innervate the larynx? It gives branches to the cardiac plexus, esophagus and trachea in addition to the muscles of the larynx. Hence its circuitous route is necessary and not inefficient. I do thyroidectomies all the time and have to be careful not to injure any part of the nerve during the dissection, not just the branches that serve the larynx. Also, the superior laryngeal nerve does give a direct connection to the larynx, and complements the recurrent laryngeal nerve and provides redundancy in function, so a more direct pathway already exists.""

Oh goodie you can read wikipedia

If anything it misunderstands the purpose of design, efficiency.

&gt;There are unusual conditions in which either the right or left recurrent laryngeal nerves do not loop around in the chest but rather directly innervate the larynx. In such individuals, there is the potential for significant problems in swallowing and breathing. Ironically, if you subscribe to the evolutionary paradigm, such conditions may represent example of mutations that regularly occur but yet evolution ""chooses"" not to select out for the more direct route!

Interesting...so they admit it is bad design but say ask ""well why doesn't evolution select for the better design huh?""
The answer being while evolution is powerful...it goes for the ""quickest"" solution, not the most ""efficient"" 9ne. If the design hypothesis was true, we would see that instead of what we have

It is beyond infuriating to see those of you try and screw up my passion for computers and use ""tech"" terms in a conversation where it most certainly does not belong. Not only do I have to sit and watch screw up my area of passion, I also have to watch back in exasperation as you try and bamboozle people with ""tech"" words which you use out of place - in other words, said creationists use these ""tech"" terms in an area where they have no applicability.

This is a strong suggestion that this isn't occurring through generations of accumulating errors: we introduce a lethal mutagen.

So, this still isn't a pure error catastrophe. This is an acute condition, where as error catastrophe is chronic.

The wide variety of shapes of birth canals around the world is evidence for neutral mutations from genetic drift, as well as evidence against a recent bottleneck, and also against a strict dualistic antagonism of evolutionary forces of a widely held theory of the ""obstetric dilemma"" - 

&gt;  ‘obstetrical dilemma’ - whereby locomotory efficiency poses a limit to the size of the birth canal in our species, sometimes leading to childbirth complications due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion (a mismatch between the size of the fetus' skull and the mother's birth canal).

This theorised obstetric dilemma was thought to

&gt; The shape of a mother’s birth canal is a tug-of-war between two opposing evolutionary forces: It needs to be wide enough to allow our big-brained babies to pass through, yet narrow enough to allow women to walk efficiently.

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1807

That being said, there has been evidence 

&gt; Despite this seeming lack of change in average pelvic morphology, we show that humans have evolved a complex link between pelvis shape, stature, and head circumference that was not recognized before. The identified covariance patterns contribute to ameliorate the “obstetric dilemma.” Females with a large head, who are likely to give birth to neonates with a large head, possess birth canals that are shaped to better accommodate large-headed neonates. Short females with an increased risk of cephalopelvic mismatch possess a rounder inlet, which is beneficial for obstetrics. We suggest that these covariances have evolved by the strong correlational selection resulting from childbirth. 

https://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5655.short

tl;dr

Birth canals are evidence that humans undergo neutral mutations and genetic drift. 
Birth canals are evidence against a recent Adam and Eve / Noah's Flood genetic bottleneck a few thousand years ago.

Shockingly he ‘misunderstood’ the arguments that were made to explain why it's fruitless to carbon test Dino fossils.

Here are a few of his basic misunderstandings:

&gt;One form of radiometric dating is often used to compare with another, and this case should be no different.

Except the half life of different isotopes are well known. There is zero point in comparing C14 dating to K-Ar, U-Pb etc. I don’t use a thermometer for snow temperature to check my BBQ when I’m searing steaks at 700F. It would be useless. 

&gt;particularly when the science of biochemistry justifies believing that this material could be within the range of C14 testing.

Why should we accept that these may fossils of magnitude younger than many other dating methods suggest when you’ve yet to demonstrate that the methods of burial / preservation precludes what Schweitzer found. 

&gt;How do you know [the fossils] are too old [for carbon dating]?

Here is a simple primer on the subject. We will (and again, I want to stress briefly) look at lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronostratigraphy.  Hopefully this sparks some discussion, and gives people a starting off place for some more reading. 

Nicholas Steno, a Catholic Priest posited the first laws of stratigraphy: The law of superposition, the principle of horizontality, the principle of lateral continuity, and the principle of cross cutting relationships. These basic ideas are not new, steno published them in his Dissertationis prodromus in 1669. 

The law of superposition states that the older layers are deeper than younger layers. For example, if you dig down in your yard, each soil horizon you encounter is older than the one above it.

The principle of horizontality states that rocks are largely deposited horizontally. For the purposes of this discussion we can assume horizontal deposition. 

The principle of lateral continuity states that the deposition will extend on a horizontal plane, in theory for ever. Like the principle of horizontality, this is not strictly true, but it is sufficient for this example. An example of when this principle is used is in a canyon, it can be assumed that similar rocks on either side of the canyon were deposited at the together.

Finally the principle of cross cutting relationships states that if a layer is cut by another rock, the rock that cut the layer must be younger. 

There is one more important bit think to know before we are ready to look at some examples, unconformities. An unconformity occurs when there is a hiatus from deposition. There are four types of unconformities. Angular, disconformity, paraconformity, and non-conformity.  However for the purposes of this post, we will not get into the specifics of each. 

Now we can examine the simple diagram [here](https://imgur.com/a/UU2eaAD). I put the M in myself, as it appears the creator of this exercise forgot to label the layer, or I need to visit my optometrist. 

I pulled the image from [this site](http://tsime.uz.ac.zw/claroline/backends/download.php?url=L0hHTF8xMDVfQVBQTElFRF9HRU9MT0dZX0lfUkVMQVRJVkVfREFUSU5HX0VYRVJDSVNFUy5wZGY%3D&amp;cidReset=true&amp;cidReq=HGL105).
 

Starting from youngest to oldest.

A, followed by B due to cross cutting. Then there is an unconformity, followed by the deposition of M, D, E, F, G, and H. The rocks then underwent tilting, then there was another hiatus. Following the second unconformity I, J, K, and L were deposited, before Dike C penetrated all of the layers. I should note, that even if the creator of the exercise wasn’t so kinds as to label the unconformities, they are easy to spot by the erosional surfaces (wavy lines).

So far we have assigned relatives ages to the rocks, using techniques that are over 300 years old.

Next we can look at fossils, as this example doesn’t include biostratigraphy, we’ll just put some fossils in the layers. 

Rocks A (most likely some metamorphic basement rock, B, and C all do not have fossils as they are not sedimentary. 

Below we have the rocks in the upper case letters, and the fossil types in lower case letters. 

* L: a, b, c 
* K: a, c 
* J: a, c, d
* I: a, c, d
* H: a, e, f
* G: a, e, f, g
* F: a, e, f
* E: a, f, h
* D: f
* M: f, i 

So from this limited example, we see fossil a and f both covering wide ranges of time, making them usesless for dating rocks. Meanwhile fossils b, g, h, and i are present only in a single, layer. If these fossils cover a wide geographical area, they may be good index fossils. An index fossil is a short lived organism, that covered a very wide geographic area. This allows geologists to narrow down the age of the rocks containing an index fossil.

Geologists have been using both of these methods of dating for centuries. Recently, radiometric dating has made dating rocks much easier.  Using granite B and dike C we can use radiometric dating to get an absolute upper and lower bounds for this entire suit of rock, save rock A. 

By combing this information, along with the information with other study areas, we can continue to put stricter bounds on the age of the rocks.  For example if we find fossil g sandwiched between two igneous layers without the unconformities in this example, we can reduce the range of time that layer G was deposited in this example. 

Hopefully this sheds some light on why lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy,  and chronostratigraphy are not circular. This also shows why carbon dating fossils found within the upper and lower bounds of this example is a waste of resources. We know what the limits of the ages of the rocks.",10,37,1570676714,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfry62/stratigraphy_a_very_brief_introduction/

This is because evolution cannot produce indivisible entities; every product of evolution is a composite of smaller parts (organs, tissues, cells, organelles, etc.) that have come together to produce an entity that is indisputably divisible. So souls cannot have evolved. Nor, Harari says, does it make sense to think that souls just “appeared one day in the fullness of their glory. \[... B\]iology cannot explain the birth of a baby possessing an eternal soul from parents who did not have even a shred of a soul”. (This discussion goes on on pages 103-106.)

I had never encountered this argument before, and Harari doesn't cite anyone as offering this sort of view (either in favor of it or against it). Is this sort of idea widespread, or is Harari on his own in making this observation? I'm writing my undergraduate Philosophy thesis on this idea, and if there are any thinkers, pro-evolution or creationist, whose writings touch on this idea either directly or indirectly, I'd love to get the community's recommendations on stuff I might read on the topic.

DebateEvolution,dcqm6i,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.DebateEvolution,,Question about something on Talk Origins,"As most of you here are aware, Talk Origins is often cited as the go-to source on the web for refuting creationist arguments. Well I've been examining one of the articles there about polystrate fossil trees, and there's something I'm needing help understanding on this page:  


 [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

In it, we see the following statement:  


&gt; As for Malone's ""problem"" with the ""thousands of years"" for the tree to remain upright for ""slow accumulation"" to occur, it is a non-problem - he is simply interpolating the average depositional rates for an entire formation down to the scale of metres. This is *not* the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur. In short, he is assuming conventional geologists would interpret the occurrence the simple way he has interpolated - they do not. 

  
So if I understand him right here, he's saying that the tree log is buried by successive waves of rapid local floods, with many thousands or millions of years sandwiched in between the layers? I don't understand how that solves the fundamental problem that the tree would not just sit there without rotting away while waiting to be fossilized.

DebateEvolution,d4ktwu,RCero,,t2_liv2e,self.DebateEvolution,,AiG's claim of an Ark filled with animal families (kinds) instead of species is incompatible with Irreducible Complexity and more,"Recently I watched the Nye vs Ham debate (it was ok, but Bill Nye could have done it much better).

From all Ham's points, one attracted my attention: That only a pair of  each family (or genus, instead of species, was aboard the ark and afterwards (micro)evolved into all the current species. Ingenious, but extremely flawed idea. There are many ways to reject Ham's hypothesis, for example today's observed mutation and speciation rate can't create so many species...also, if in the ""a pair of each species"" model it seemed impossible for the low reproduction-rate animal pairs to spread and proliferate up to today's big numbers in so little time, a ""a pair of each family"" ark exacerbates the problem, as part of their descendants has to be turned into other species by Ham magic super-microevolution.

But that's not what I want to talk about.

It's about a common counter-argument against evolution: the Irreducible complexity of characteristics that supposedly can't be break down to smaller changes. Creationism/ID are categorical about micro-evolution can't create new characteristics beyond ""size"", ""color"" or disabling/enabling a gene that was already there.

**BUT**, if all current species were generated from a pair of a species, **if we find in characteristics in species that fit in the Irreducible complexity** definition which **aren't shared with the other members of the same family**, that would mean **(micro?)evolution can generate the so-called Irreducible complexity**, IC can't exist and **there's nothing stopping micro-evolution from turning into MACROevolution.**

Thanks, Ken Ham, for supporting evolution with AiG's YEC theories.

PS: Isn't it funny that Ham's theory is backed up with the fossil record? Creationists are always repeating the ""gaps"" in the fossil record discredit Darwinism, but they have no problem in using it in their post-ark super-micro-evolution, despite the alleged lack of transitional forms.",34,23,1568556201,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/d4ktwu/aigs_claim_of_an_ark_filled_with_animal_families/

I haven't read the paper that this article is based on, but there are a few simple take aways from the AP article.

Jee used two instances of gravitational lenses to come up with a new Hubble Constant, resulting in a margin of error that includes 13.7 billion years in her work.  

And as per the article:

&gt;Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who wasn't part of the study, said it is an interesting and unique way to calculate the universe's expansion rate, but the large error margin limits its effectiveness until more information can be gathered.
""It is difficult to be certain of your conclusions if you use a ruler that you don't fully understand,"" Loeb said in an email.

I don't have know enough about cosmology to know if this is relevant criticism, or just a failing of media reporting on science.

Finally I'm very confused as to why the YECers are excited about this new finding.

&gt;I have been scanning around at several of the other subreddits devoted to Christianity, even the supposedly conservative-leaning ones, and I have started to notice an almost complete absence of representation for what I believe is the true Biblical view of origins: so-called ""young-earth"" creationism.

&gt;I hope I'm wrong about this, but that's the impression I am getting. If so, it's a sad indicator of things to come, as I think the general trend is that Reddit is somewhat representative of the attitudes of younger generations as a whole. Just a conversation-starter. Obviously this subreddit is a very small enclave, and even here there is no obvious consensus supporting young earth creation, or at least it is not unanimous.

DebateEvolution,czecid,SpecialistRaisin,,t2_3ghp3u3o,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Are the problems raised against Mendel's Accountant really that damning?,"Recently I came across an old argument about the degree to which Mendel's Accountant, a population genetics simulator, could be said to have accurately demonstrated that a genome would deteriorate over time under natural selection. The argument eventually reached a point where a contributor raised four points that seemed to have been directly drawn from this forum post ([http://www.rationalskepticism.org/creationism/mendel-s-accountant-t2991.html](http://www.rationalskepticism.org/creationism/mendel-s-accountant-t2991.html)), to which the other poster responded with various rebuttals that went unanswered.

\&gt; 1. ""in Mendel's Account, the total ratio of non-functional human DNA is equal to zero."" -&gt; This person has no idea what they're talking about. The default is 10 function altering mutations per generation with 0.001% of those beneficial with the rest deleterious. With \~100 mutations per generation these parameters assume \~90% of mutations are neutral, which are not tracked.

\&gt; 2.""no such thing as gene linkage has been included in the model"" -&gt; Wrong again. The [Mendel manual](http://mendelsaccount.sourceforge.net/userman.pdf) goes through all the parameters for linkage blocks. You say that not simulating linkage ""favour\[2\] accumulation of non-harmful mutations"" but the opposite is true. Linkage causes hitchhiking of deleterious mutations with beneficial mutations

\&gt; 3. ""the program does not simulate sexual selection at all"" -&gt; Correct. But sexual selection favors the pretty over the functional--they are not always the same. Simulating sexual selection increases the rate at which deleterious mutations accumulate.

\&gt; 4. ""the program does not allow for gene duplication events."" -&gt; Correct. But Mendel's model is more generous to evolution than if gene duplication were simulated.

Firstly, my apologies for posting it hard on the heels of another person's post asking for similar assistance. I too have a creationist trying to demonstrate why evolution cannot be trusted and the bible holds all the answers, etc. I'm not a scientist, much less a geneticist, and much of this article is beyond me (and beyond her too but that's beside the point). 

I've responded that if the arguments made in the article had any merit, they'd have been posted in a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal, not at creation.com, but that's all I've got - and it's quite possible that unbeknowns to me the arguments may well have been presented somewhere else. 

What I'd like to know, if there are people here knowledgeable enough to understand the article and respond to it, is whether the commonly-heard assertion that humans &amp; chimps are 95-98% alike in terms of their DNA is actually correct, or if it involves flawed if not outright biased assumptions as this article alleges &amp; the true figure is a lot lower?

DebateEvolution,csf7jp,ammuseskepsci19,,t2_4e8ny8m6,self.DebateEvolution,,Dismantling Creationist Counter Responses to Genetic Evidence,"Hi guys,

Often in arguments with creationists, they completely dismiss the genetic evidence by saying that if the genetic sequence/DNA is similar between different species, etc. then this is proof of a common designer who used the “same code” (like the author of a book who uses the letters of the alphabet) instead of common ancestry. This is such an absurd claim and it demonstrates that they have no idea what they’re talking about. Therefore, I’m going to completely dismantle their entire argument using evidence from the monoclonality of tumours in cancer.

Cancer is considered to be a genetic and cell-signalling disease and one consequence of cancer is the development of tumours (neoplasms) – an abnormal mass of immortalised cells.

One way in which cancers develop is when particular mutations arise in cells. Once a mutation appears in a cell, it is transferred to all the descendants of that cell. Therefore, when one examines two or more cancer cells in a tumour and identifies the same complex mutation in their DNA, it establishes that those cells are related. The singular mutation was transmitted from that ancestral cell to all its descendants. A cell population descended from a single progenitor is called a clone. In 1976, PC Nowell proposed this idea of clonal succession – where tumours develop by sequential replacement of increasingly more malignant clones. Therefore, most tumours are monoclonal, meaning that they arise from onealtered cell. The monoclonality of tumours is supported by multiple lines of evidence:

·  **X chromosome inactivation**: Early in the development of a female, there is random silencing of one X-chromosome in each cell. In normal tissues, maternal and paternal alleles of the X-linked gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) are each expressed in 50% of the cells. However, in tumours, the same allele is expressed in all cells – indicating they are all descended from the one cell expressing that allele. 

·  **In B and T lymphocytes**, when one of several V, D, and J segments assemble, antigen receptor genes (such as IGH,TCR) ensue. V-D and D-J coding joints are formed randomly and have a high degree of variability. In normal populations of lymphocytes, a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) across these junctions generates multiple products. In lymphomas (blood cancers) however, only oneproduct is generated via PCR – indicating that every cell is descended from the one cell in which that distinctive IGH or TCR rearrangement arose.

·  **Tumours arising from oncogenic viruses**: DNA from the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) (which cause liver and cervical cancer, respectively) is inserted into the genome of cells at randomly chosen sites. Every individual tumour has a different viral DNA insertion site and every cell in any particular tumour has the same insertion site – because every cell is descended from the one cell in which that unique insertion event occurred.

·  **Mutations in ‘cancer genes’**: A unique DNA insertion, deletion, duplication or rearrangement/gene fusion may distinguish every cell in a tumour. For example, leukaemia’s may develop in identical monochorionic twins at 4-6 years of age with the same mutation. This arose from a mutant clone distributed throughout a shared placenta, *in utero*. 

·  **Mutations of the mitochondrial genome**: A mutation in a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule may replace all the wild-type mtDNA molecules within that mitochondrion. After that, all the normal mitochondria in a cell are replaced with the mutant mitochondrion; and then all the normal cells in a tissue are replaced with the mutant cell – common in cancer. Every cell with the mtDNA mutation is descended from the onecell in which the mutation arose.

Therefore, clones and lineages of cells are identified by shared mutations. 

What’s great about this is that it also applies to evolution via the same logic. The monoclonal nature of oncogenesis (cancer development) is established by the genetic evidence in the same way that phylogenesis (species development) is supported.

When multiple individuals share singular complex mutations, then all those individuals are descended from the one reproductive cell of the single individual in whom that mutation occurred. Therefore, if multiple species share singular mutations at the same location in their DNA, then all those species are derived from the one species (the single reproductive cell) in which each of those mutations occurred. **Therefore, the monoclonality of tumours (which are evolving populations of cancer cells) perfectly corresponds with the law of monophyly in species (populations capable of producing fertile offspring) development.**

In cancer, if all the cells in a tumour share a particular mutation (clonal), this is known as a founder mutation. Within this, you may have different populations of cells that have their own unique mutations (in addition to the founder mutation). These unique mutations that belong to distinct cell populations within the tumour are called passenger mutations and these populations are known as subclones. Therefore, you have subclones within clones. Likewise, for evolution, you have clades within clades – where a particular mutation, endogenous retrovirus (ERV) insert, transposable element (jumping gene), or pseudogene may be found within every member of that clade (and therefore arose within the single reproductive cell of a common ancestor); and within this clade you can have new clades arising with their own unique mutations (while still belonging to their parent clade). This is clearly evidence of common ancestry. When you consider cancer cells, these are obviously naturally occurring and therefore not “designed by an intelligence,” and since they all share the same mutation – they arose from the same common ancestor. Likewise, the similarity in DNA sequences between different species and the same location of mutations is evidence of common ancestry.

Why do you people even defend him at all after what he said? If a creationists said half the insanity he spoke he'd instantly be petitioned to be hit with charges.","This is the person all of you look up to.

While he will claim he doesn't defend it after the fact and only says that ""it was a different Era bla bla"", basic human psychology tells us he's using this argument to get the entire argument as a whole of him thinking having sex with minor is totally and evolutionarily ok.

Technically for a species to evolve. The healthiest mates and the highest chance of producing the most offspring and as early as possible is when a human is 13-14. 

Because many males aren't attractive or desirable to women anyway especially evolutinists, in an ideal world where the survival of the fittest is in full swing, a man who just wants to do what his body demands of him which is to have sex and produce offspring, would simply fight off and take a young 14 year old, threaten her that he has the power and can harm her but if she obeys everything will be OK. He will then abuse her and bare children and his stupid genes will pass on and he won the ""game of passing on his genes"" which is the staple of evolution and the staple of ""evolving"".

Dawkins in an ideal world not populated by majority who believe in a God, would not hesitate to make arguments passing laws to allow legal sex as young as 13, after all, they first imagine their theory, and then go to the lab to find evidence to prove it. Whatever they find as ""evidence"" is instantly in support of their theory and never against it. Which is how all ""evidence of evolution is"". You find similar structures and find the same multi cellular organisms and the same DNA sequencing and molecules forming it, but yet take that evidence as ""support for evolution"". Any open minded could easily debunk that and say finding similarities doesn't mean it's common ancestry. Maybe the common ancestry is from a common creator who obviously used the same programming in the form of DNA and multi cellular organism to create the life.

You guys think had it been a real creator he'd have made some have DNA, and the others be made of gas or something with silicon replacing carbon, and the amino acids and the DNA made entirely of different molecules?

That would also be just plain dumb to assume that. A common creator is just as much a possibility when looking at the same evidence as ancestry.

But anyway back to Dawkins. He's insane. Anyone who writes a book specifically having it all be about ad hominen attacks and straw man arguments and absolutely nothing about the actual science is insane. Doesn't Dawkins have anything better to do than try and claim anyone who simply chooses to believe in a creator is insane or stupid or wicked? That's what he says. I mean he's not open minded at all. The worst part is his arrogance and conceit. Just a little man who can easily be picked apart by arguments and especially physically by the very people he insults. Of course he has to hide behind books. I feel bad for him and I'd laugh in his face if he attempted to ridicule me. I'd look at him and laugh.

So - how to creationists explain the following set of observations?

1) Almost 70% of mutations are cytosine to thymine deaminations

2) Human de no vo mutations in our species reflects this predominance of cytosine to thymine deaminations

3) Comparison of human to chimpanzee genomes demonstrates the same predominance of cytosine -&gt; thymine deaminations

It is unintentional.

It is unpredictable.

What is left to distinguish an act as random?

I trust that nobody here will argue that the first definition of random applies to natural selection.

The second definition is proven applicable in the claim that evolution is without direction.  Any act that is without direction is unpredictable, which makes it random.  You cannot have it both ways.

Let me address a couple of anticipated objections.

1) Saying that a given creature will adapt to its surroundings in such a way that facilitates its survival is not the sort of prediction that proves the process is not random.  I might truly predict that a six-sided die will come up 1-6 if I roll it, but that does not make the outcome non-random.  

And in the case of evolution, I might not even roll the die if the creature dies.

And can you predict whether or not the creature will simply leave the environment altogether for one more suited to it?


2) That naked mole rat.  This is not a prediction based exclusively evolutionary assumptions but on the belief that creatures who live in a given environment will be suited to that environment, a belief which evolutionary theory and ID have in common. 
*The sort of prediction one would have to make is to predict the course of changes a given species will undergo in the future.*  I trust that nobody believes this is possible.

**But here is the essential point.**  Anyone who wishes to make a serious objection to my claim must address this, it seems to me: Everyone believes that mutation is random, and yet mutation is subject to the exact same four fundamental forces of nature that govern the circumstances of selection.  **If selection is not random which of these forces do not apply to those circumstances?**",0,199,1565720604,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/cpx5bm/why_i_think_natural_selection_is_random/

DebateEvolution,cnyl59,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Musings on the momentum within science.,"Far too often deniers of science claim that invalid positions ranging from anthropogenic climate change deniers to creationists are being silenced.  Unsurprisingly the gatekeeper is never named, could it be the science overlords or possibly hypnotoad himself?  I guess we’ll never know. 

I’m not going to argue that there isn’t any truth to the old adage ‘Science advances one death at a time’.  Clearly scientists are human, egos, competitiveness, and yes, petty bickering slow the unstoppable force of progress. Sadly this means brilliant individuals do not live to see their groundbreaking ideas become accepted.

Ludwig Boltzmann is probably currently most famous for the  ‘Boltzmann Brain’ idea. He’s also know for his fierce debate with Ernst Mach over the existence of atoms.  The debate was settled by none other than Albert Einstein in 1905.  It’s unclear if Boltzmann was aware of Einstein’s work when he took his own life in 1906. 

Afred Wegener, veteran, explorer, meteorologist, and geophysicist published ‘Alfred Wegener’s Hypothesis on Continental Drift and Its Discussion in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen’ in 1912.  Sadly he passed away in an icy grave in the ill named Greenland, 30 odd years before this hypothesis would accepted.

Nicolaus Copernicus, unlike the above two legends, passed away peacefully  at the ripe age of 70. He passed in 1543, the same year his ‘De revolutionibus orbium coelestium’ argued for a heliocentric model.  While his work was considered excellent, it was not widely adopted until over 100 years later.  

I’d be remiss if we didn’t touch on Gregor Mendel, abbot of St Thomas’s abby in Brünn, and father of heredity.  He passed way from kidney failure in 1884, sixteen years before his work would be accepted.

Finally we have the grim case of Ignaz Semmelweis, an obstetrician. Semmelweis was quick to realize that when basic hygiene such as hand washing became procedure in hospitals, less people died. Sadly Semmelweis didn’t know about germ theory, and couldn’t describe the mechanism for his observations. As such his ideas were rejected.  Semmelweis took the rejection poorly, became depressed and began abusing alcohol.  In 1865 Ferdinand Ritter Von Hebra invited Semmelweis to go on a tour of a mental institute.  The tour was a rouse, Hebra planned to admit Semmelweis. Semmelweis quickly became wise to the plan, and attempted to escape. The guard quickly caught him, and beat him badly. Semmelweis died from his injuries two weeks later. Without Semmelweis pushing hand washing, deaths in the hospital climbed six fold. 

‘The Origin of Species’ (and of course ‘On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species’ by Wallace), stopped thousands of years of momentum, although sadly not before Darwin and Wallace passed. Although unlike atomic theory, plate tectonics, and germ theory, creationism still has faint memories of that momentum 150 years later. Creationists have had 150 years to prove evolution false, 150 years to publish a papers in support of their conjecture.  I posit to you creationists, that you cannot publish not due to a grand conspiracy, but because at the heart of the matter, creationism is simply a hypothetical, a fairy tail that you’re not ready to give up on.

Sounds promising, right? Many of us have been asking for a testable hypothesis for *years*, decades in some cases. Are we *finally* going to get one?

Haha. Of course not. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the ""hypothesis"" presented by Kirk Durston:

&gt;A unique property of intelligent minds is the ability to produce statistically significant levels of functional information as defined in the literature.

Okay, that's a hypothesis. How can we test this? Well, we can randomly generate some stuff, like nucleic acid sequences, and determine if they contain statistically significant levels of ""functional information"". If they do, then this hypothesis is falsified. That actually works. 

Let's see how Durston proposes we evaluate this hypothesis:

&gt;The hypothesis stated above provides the basis for a scientific method to test any effect to see if it required intelligence to produce.

&gt;&gt;Step One: Evaluate the level of functional information required to produce the effect.

&gt;&gt;Step Two: Determine if the level of functional information is statistically significant.

&gt;&gt;Step Three: If it is statistically significant, then we can infer that intelligence was required to produce the effect.

Oh. Ooooooooooooooh. That ""hypothesis"" quoted above? That wasn't a hypothesis. That was a *premise*. 

I'm not sure if Durston is just missing the logic, or actually thinks this is how hypothesis testing works, or something else, but this is *not* a way to detect design, since the method itself, which is assumed to be valid, is the thing up for debate when it comes to ""biological design"". If ""only intelligence generates functional information"" is your premise, you don't have a way to evaluate a design hypothesis.

DebateEvolution,ckfj5j,ThurneysenHavets,MA Historical Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,“Prehistoric archaeological cultures were simultaneous”. Welcome to another colossally ignorant YEC rationalisation.,"This is an argument I heard from a YEC friend in real life and I’d like to briefly rant about it.

The archaeology of prehistoric Europe is complex. There’s a succession of archaeological cultures, migrations, technological innovations, and so forth, many of which are conventionally thought to have *individually* lasted for thousands of years. YECs need to fit *all* of it, from Neanderthals to the Bronze Age, into the few centuries between the Tower of Babel and the beginning of recorded history. Which is... crazy.

Simple solution? Many of these societies coexisted; the periodisation is wrong; and it’s only the “evolutionists” who are reading lengthy timescales into it. CMI [confirms](https://creation.com/the-stone-age-a-figment-of-the-imagination) that this is not an isolated view.

Now the lovely thing about this argument is that we don’t even have to argue about absolute dating to show why it’s wrong. It’s so unutterably idiotic that we can debunk it with relative dating alone. And there are quite a few ways of proving that two societies weren’t contemporaneous.

Let's run over just a few.

- *Stratigraphy* is a mainstay of conventional archaeology. In the best case consecutive layers are *physically* superimposed on top of each other. You cannot simultaneously inhabit the building you’ve just destroyed to build a new one on top of. Seriously.

- *Carbon dating* is routinely used (and sometimes a range of other dating methods such as thermoluminescence, obsidian rim dating, etc.). You don’t have to believe these methods work to accept that they exclude the possibility of simultaneity. Even *relative* C14 tags up with stratigraphy ([this is an example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0A693962BF0D6970DB25CC20C74D8A83/S0003598X00069799a.pdf/sitagroi_radiocarbon_and_the_prehistory_of_southeast_europe.pdf)). A radiocarbon sample doesn’t know whether it’s supposed to be Chalcolithic or Bronze Age.

- *Technology* changes over time. Sure, different degrees of technological advancement can coexist, but there’s a limit to this explanation. To give just a single example, why do societies with evidence for wheel-related technology, for instance, *never* occur in Palaeolithic sites, if these coexisted with more advanced societies? Why does copper precede the (much superior for many purposes) bronze? ... and so forth.

- *Changes spread geographically*. For instance, the C14 dates for the earliest Neolithic sites grow [progressively younger as you go north-westwards](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/6456919/10.1.1.163.1621.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DNeolithic_transition_in_Europe_the_radio.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190728%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20190728T015636Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=2a3e441f4cba218c393601f2102b1a662ab177fb936d7482a46cd1dec6fb66bc), consistent with a gradual spread of agriculture from the Middle East. How is this supposed to work if these sites are basically simultaneous? Do C14 dates line up in geographical progression just to piss off YECs or what?

- *Migrations leave genetic evidence*. The Neolithic revolution may again serve as an illustration. It is accompanied by the arrival of [distinctive Middle Eastern haplogroups which are *absent* from Mesolithic forager populations](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/53061694/Anthony___Brown_2017_Molecular_archaeology_and_Indo-European_linguistics_last_proof.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMolecular_archaeology_and_Indo-European.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190728%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20190728T021910Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=969c51967fe5b8b14ebbc1cdbdfc81e749153e0110a3a116aa63b8248e770280). If the Neolithic revolution wasn't real - which is what the [""simultaneous"" bs pretty much explicitly implies](https://creation.com/a-better-model-for-the-stone-age) - there's no reason why Neolithic settlements should be marked by the arrival of a new group of people. (Also, obviously, migrations followed by interbreeding take time.)

- *Human settlements interact with the environment*. Just one example: [pollen samples](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034666717300209) may indicate the increasing presence of cultivated crops, or deforestation, and so forth, as human subsistence styles change. Obviously, an area is either forested or it is not. It cannot be both simultaneously. Thereby excluding any nonsense about the different societies associated with these subsistence styles having systematically coexisted.

And so forth and so on. The above obviously only scratches the surface. And again, it illustrates only the wrongness of the argument in *relative* terms, on the [completely academic assumption that absolute dating is unreliable](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c6ceiz/possibly_my_alltime_favourite_c14_dating_graph/).

So if any YEC wants to rise to the challenge: feel free. Give me an explanation – any explanation – for the lengthy prehistory you guys basically deny that isn’t *eyewateringly* idiotic, and I’ll be happy to discuss it.",24,19,1564612249,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ckfj5j/prehistoric_archaeological_cultures_were/

**GOD CREATED EVOLUTION.
**MRSA-RESISTANT VIRUSES, etc. are examples of evolution.[/QUOTE]

Unfortunately evolutionists forget that biology is really the child of organic chemistry. All biology fundamentally is organic chemistry and organic chemistry is atomic interactions.

Go look at nature and observe what nature outside of life aka plants and animals create. They never create anything complex. Even diamonds are just a single element squeezed together.

Everything in nature is either some element that is an Oxide or a chloride or a sulfite.

Never in nature does carbon exist in any form other than diamonds or graphite or carbon dioxide. Never in nature will you find hydrogen anywhere except in water. Nitrogrn doesn't react with anything most of the time. Oxygen destroys any organic molecules and also doesn't really react readily with it.

What's the point?

People like to run away and say that evolution simply deals with life only after it began, but in reality evolution starts with the big bang and includes everything after it.

Therefore, how can you ever in nature have any organic molecule even the simplest ones form such as ethanol or methane or ammonia? They never form.

Yet were supposed to believe out of no available chemicals somehow left handed amino acids formed and survived for millions of years... In an oxygen free environment which means there was no Ozone and thus UV light and even visible light would destroy those same amino acids. Then those amino acids formed proteins which we cannot even synthesize from scratch in the lab or even properly simulate how it folds in super computers. Remember PS3 and the app ""folding at home"". No one knew wtf it was but it was meant to simulate protein folding because it's that complex and needed that many computers to do it. Somehow though proteins that decay so fast formed and then survived. Then one day they needed to make impossible lucky arrangement of a sugar phosphate backbone which never happens in nature but there would need to be quafrillions of these molecules all at the same time and the atgc codons in dna had to somehow attach together and fold properly and then without a translate enzyme to define what those codes meant and a cell membrane to survive in or a chromosome for the DNA to be packed in, it survived and formed a ""simple cell"" which is more complex in sophistication and comparatively if compared with computer bits, orders of magnitude more complicated than any computer code ever, and then that dna survived and then somehow knew how to reproduce already because without reproduction it would die. Also it needed oxygen which oxygen is also just so unpleasant for life BTW. You see for millions of years they were still evolving the basic necessities to even exist at all so they all died until one of them finally made itself again from the ashes of the failed earlier cell experiments until it reproduced and got the hang of it until it divided in this soup and then got lost in the ocean as soon as it divided... It's single chromosome divided. And then it died.

Let's skip and imagine it succeeded. One day, an animal decided it needs eyes. How it could possible understand the need for eyes when early brains would be essentially equivalent and less intelligent than a 1980s 8 bit cpu but life found a way to evolve eyes slowly. Somehow while we like to imagine it could happen, no one ever ponders how nature could possible understand how to construct even the most basic light sensitive eye. Imagine, you would need to know what chemical material to use and how to connect that material with nerves to a central nervous system to process that info. Such an ""adaptation"" could not possible have happened since you can't adapt to something and create something new that you never knew existed. It's like if we ""adapted"" to be able to ""see"" or at least ""perceive"" radio waves or see the 4th dimension of time and witness the future but we wouldn't consciously try and ""adapt"" this ability but somehow subconsciously we would. And this boils down to the DNA having to make on its own, brand new code.. And we all know how even a single letter in a line or computer code can crash the software and likewise in animals just a few nucleotides aka the letters of the DNA being off is fatal. Somehow were to imagine evolution did this? Evolution is nothing more than God for atheists. Evolution+time for atheists can do what no intelligence on earth can. Actually tinker with and create new functionalities in organic beings via DNA when today we cannot synthesize in a lab basic proteins properly if at all much less far more complicated macro molecules or enzymes. DNA is so far out of our realm. The only thing we know about DNA is the chemical composition of the codons and the arrangement. We don't understand how those arrangements mean anything neither would we know how to synthesize dna since the way it folds is not possible for us to replicate in any lab at all. Even if we could Wed realize how nearly impossible it is for nature to do it unless it was programmed to do so. The only explanation how DNA even works is if our universe exists how a computer exists. In other words, anyone outside of the computer understands how to create a computer code and how it functions in 1s and 0s yet anything that runs off that code doesn't even comprehend that it's nothing but 1s and 0s. For all we know, dna exists because somewhere outside of our observable universe is the true translation matrix that enables a certain arrangements of chemicals in dna to even mean anything at all. But that's just an educated guess and this part isnt about evolution.

Point is evolution cannot happen because dna cannot permit it.

Furthermore. If evolution was true. We would only have either one chromosome that gets more and more complicated as each new species ""evolves"" and remember you can't have any errors or mistakes in the DNA or else it's death, or, each more advanced species should have more chromosomes than the last and any new information will always be found in the newest chromosome at the end of the nucleotide sequence, sort of like a book you keep adding too if it's one single chromosome or multiple volumes of books with each new volume indicating a new species and the newest chromosome would have the highest and most up to date species aka humans. Yet in nature we don't find this to be true. Some of the dumbest animals have double the chromosomes humans do. Similarities we claim exist between us and apes such as similar radius and ulna etc are found entirely in a different chromosome and the gene is found elsewhere. This goes against evolution entirely. Just think about it.

OH and I know someone will say chromosome count doesn't matter because the ""tree of life"" keeps branching off from each other, but even if this was the case, you would under your own evolutionary theory, expect that each line of the tree you follow the gene count and the chromosome number would go up. You cannot expect a tree wherein total gene count in all chromosomes and chromosome number should go up and down and up, and Gene count should go down at all. Losing entire chromosomes and genes is the opposite of evolution. It makes absolutely no sense. The genes for radius and ulna or the eyes between the supposed great ape family including humans are all found in different chromosomes and genes. Evolution would dictate that they would be found exactly in the same place. You cannot expect a progressive and linear progression if the chromosomes especially where the genes for certain parts are found are all over the place between supposed similar species. Also, the intelligence between our supposed great ape cousins compared to humans is so vastly different its unreal. DNA and chromosomes should have long ago given massive evidence towards evolution if we noticed the same tree of life growing in number of chromosomes or if we found the same genes that did the same thing between similar species such as humans and apes in the same place, but we do not. Not even close. Even a minor mutation in nucleotides can be fatal, there is nearly no possibility of change. Similarly like I said to a line of computer code. Mess up a single letter and tell me how your million character code breaks apart and fails.

If we are to believe fire is what made us ""evolve"", are you saying then we can teach apes how to make fire today and eventually they'd evolve ad well? Evolution dictates they must. Not to mention, if we could teach apes how to drive or all be experts in sign language like that one ape named coco which you can YouTube, according to evolutionary theory life experience can evolve a species especially if the entire population does similar things.

Therefore I say, there are elephants today that can draw perfectly. If all elephants today all were taught how to draw every day, by evolutionary thinking within even a hundred years of highly accelerated, population wide elephant training to teach them art, they should be able to naturally know how to paint if given the proper tools and their minds within a couple hundred generations should then be able to create Mona Lisa's and even better... Yet.. We just don't see this happen, and we won't. This isn't how it works in real life. I must admit even I can imagine that it would work because it sounds so good and seems to make sense so well especially if you sprinkle the magic ingredient of deep time but, sorry, it doesn't work. Therefore, humanity couldn't evolve to where it did today because of life experiences, and neither did giraffes evolve because they stretched their necks. I mean seriously just think about it. Where are the other giraffe species? Shouldn't there be dozens who all wanted to eat from that tree? The idea that needing to reach a tree thus evolving the ability sounds good in imagination land, but in reality, dna prohibits it.

Months after Ken Ham's Ark Encounter was damaged by flooding, Ham argues we shouldn't be worried about climate change.","&gt;And there’s been climate change in the past. Of course, the biggest climate change was the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,350 years ago. This flood destroyed the world that then was and upset the climate... ... The world has been settling down since that flood.

&gt; And, even since the flood, we’ve seen other climate change events. There was a warming period during the Middle Ages that allowed farmers to settle and grow crops on Greenland—not something I suggest doing today! There was also a Little Ice Age in the 16th century that impacted agriculture significantly. And no one was driving cars, flying airplanes, or building factories back then!

No surprises that a man who ~~can't~~ won't understand the basic concepts of evolution will fail to understand the seriousness of climate change as well.

The difference being in this redditers opinions, creationists fall mostly on the humours side of science denialism, where as climate change denialism is a grave threat.

 As someone who began studying ToE, I still don't have many resources at hand. One of the things I have to constantly look for are transitional fossils between species.
 However, sometimes it's hard to find said fossils, whether that be due to the peculiarity of what I'm searching, or the inaccuracy of my browser engine.

  I am aware of Wikipedia's list, but it has yet to be professionally verified in some sections, and some of the sources were hard to verify.

 Thus, I humbly ask - Is there a complete list of the transitional fossils we've found, on the internet?

DebateEvolution,chzpmp,Ch3shireDev,,t2_4323z6,self.DebateEvolution,,Fundamentalist view of Bible stories vs. The Parables of Jesus,"AFAIK in fundamentalist interpretation of Bible you treat all stories as they happened exactly as described and are historical fact. This makes a lot of friction between fundamental christian and scientific atheists, because if you treat the same way scientific data and biblical knowledge, sooner or later you have to throw one away. Atheists like Dawkins or Harris decide to throw away biblical data, creationists like Ken Ham are throwing away the evolutionary data.

The problem I have with that is the literal interpretation. I have the following analogy - Jesus told many parables to his apostles. They weren't described as ""ok, listen up, that thing didn't happened, I just want you to get the idea"". And everyone are perfectly okay with that, there is a great wisdom in those parables. I also think there is a great wisdom in Genesis, since it can be interpreted for many, many years and you still can't dry the drain. It just happens that it doesn't match the scientific data about geological history of the world. Just like Jesus stories doesn't match historical data (well, we don't know, but He didn't told them to describe some exact happening, but to teach).

**But when mutations don't get expressed because they are recessive, natural selection doesn't take effect.** 

Although this alone doesn't disprove evolution, this does have significant implications:

1. How evolution is taught in schools is misleading

2. Genetics isn't strong evidence for evolution unless you ignore information and logic that isn't convenient.

It’s not evolution, it’s... it’s... it’s a ""complex rearrangement of biological information""!","Okay, ""outdoes itself"" is perhaps an exaggeration; admittedly it sets a *very* high bar. Nevertheless yesterday's creation.com article is a bit of light entertainment which I thought this sub might enjoy.

Their [Tuesday article](https://creation.com/new-sugar-transport-gene-evolved-in-yeast) discusses [the creation of a brand new gene by the duplication and subsequent combination of parts of three other genes, two of which continue to exist in their original form](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1377697/pdf/9915938.pdf). Not only is this new information by any remotely sane standard, I’m pretty sure it’s also irreducibly complex. Experts in Behe interpretation feel free to correct me.

----

But anyway creation.com put some of their spin doctors on the job and they came up with this marvellous piece of propaganda.

- First they make a half-hearted attempt to imply the whole thing is irrelevant because it was produced through “laboratory manipulation.” This line of reasoning they subsequently drop. Presumably because it’s rectally derived? I can but hazard a guess.

- They then briefly observe that new exons did not pop into existence from nothing. I mean, sure, it’s important to point these things out.

- Subsequently they insert three completely irrelevant paragraphs about how they think ancestral *eubayanus* had LgAGT1. And I mean utterly, totally, *shamelessly* irrelevant. This is the “layman deterrent” bit that so many creation.com articles have: the part of the article that is *specifically* designed to be too difficult for your target audience to follow, in the hope that it makes them just take your word for it.

- God designed the yeast genome to make this possible, they suggest. I’m not sure how this bit tags up with their previous claim that it was only laboratory manipulation... frankly I think they’re just betting on as many horses as possible.

- And finally perhaps the best bit of all:

&gt;Yet, as in the other examples, complex rearrangements of biological information, even ones that confer a new ‘function’ on the cell, are not evidence for long-term directional evolutionary changes that would create a brand new organism.

Nope, novel recombination creating a new gene coding for a function which did not previously exist clearly doesn’t count. We’ll believe evolution when we see stuff appearing out of thin air, like evolutionists keep claiming evolution happens, and with a long-term directionality, like evolutionists keep claiming evolution has, to create “brand new” organisms, which is how evolutionists are always saying evolution works.

In the meanwhile, it’s all just “complex rearrangements of biological information.”",37,135,1563970591,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ch7fg1/creationcom_outdoes_itself_with_its_latest/
DebateEvolution,ch0nq1,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"From the echo chamber: ""Anyone ever heard a good argument from the evolutionists dealing with the mathematical problem of protein generation?""","Over at /r/creation, /u/espeakadaenglish posted [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cghk6v/mathematical_challenges_to_darwins_theory_of/eul9nz6/):

&gt; Anyone ever heard a good argument from the evolutionists dealing with the mathematical problem of protein generation? I mean if there is les than a 1 in 10 to the 37th power chance of generating one single new protein in the history of life on earth how do they expect to generate the thousands (millions?) that are found in living systems?

This is the problem with existing in echo chambers and ideological bubbles: You hear one side give an argument about a subject that you're not educated in, and you don't go investigate what others have to say about it, of course you think the argument that supports your beliefs has merit.

But the counter to this is: the argument is pure bullshit. And it's a PRATT: point-refuted-a-thousand-times.

The ""big number"" probabilities that creationists are so fond of are a complete misrepresentation of science and reality. The argument assumes that there's only one possible way to get something complex to form in nature: that it has to form on its own completely without any precursors, and has to be that exact result. The chance of this all happening is so extreme, it must be impossible without some divine help.

The best way to illustrate how bad this argument is is by using the lottery as an example. There's a jackpot drawing on a given night. The chance of any single ticket matching the necessary numbers, five randomly selected, unique balls numbered 1 through 69, then 1 randomly selected ball from another pool of those numbered 1 through 26, from this particular game is 1 in 292,201,338. So astronomical that it must be impossible to win.

And if you did win with your single ticket, it must be because someone cheated and matched your numbers, since the probability was too high for you to have won legitimately.

If you ignore all other aspects of how this works, you can see why this argument makes sense. However, multiple people win the jackpot throughout the year. How can that be if the jackpot is so impossible to win?

Just like with the protein, there are so many people playing the lottery, and playing in multiple drawings, and playing multiple tickets each time. At some point, with the number of attempts, tickets will match the jackpot, even though the numbers were unknown when the ticket was purchased and the balls were selected randomly.

This is similar to how nature works. There wasn't just one attempt to build a strand of DNA to form a protein. There wasn't a specific protein in mind when this attempt was made. There are trillions of bacteria alone living inside each human body. And that's not including the human cells and other organisms alive within each person.

Now imagine how little space those organisms must take up to fit inside a human, compared to how large the world is. Back when life was starting to emerge, the necessary building blocks to form those first organisms were abundant in the seas. How many different precursors were just forming RNA strands for other reasons, then how many times were those RNA strands replicating themselves with minor errors, and how many different possible outcomes there must be where eventually a protein could be transcribed from the RNA?

These replications happen dozens of times a day at least, over millions and millions of years, over trillions upon trillions of precursors to life, with minor errors happening all the time, until finally something forms that makes this particular precursor to life edge closer to what life could be. And one of those advantageous genes eventually becomes so successful that it becomes conserved and replicated throughout the ancestors' lineages of that original self-replicating precursor to life.

That ""big number"" probability argument falls apart quickly, just because it ignores all the possibilities that were available. It assumes that the protein being offered as the goal *IS* the only possible goal, that there was ever only one attempt to reach that goal, and that there was never anything before that single attempt.

Just like buying one ticket to one drawing for the lottery makes it almost impossible that someone will win the jackpot, once you realize how many people play, how often they play, and how many times they try each time they play, it becomes very apparent how people win jackpots even though no one's cheating the game.",28,71,1563926811,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ch0nq1/from_the_echo_chamber_anyone_ever_heard_a_good/

Iridium is an incredibly unique element. It rests on the periodic table with atomic number 77, and is the second densest metal present. It's also the most corrosion resistant metal, maintaining it's integrity at temperatures up to 2000 degrees Celsius.   


It also obliterates Young Earth Creationism.   


**Part 1: The Iridium Shortage**  


Our planet is abundant in many elements, particularly those conducive to life. But as everyone knows, there are elements that are rarer than others. Iridium fits into this category.   


This element one of the rarest of those found in Earth's crust. This means that it is essentially present enough to be considered among the crustal makeup, but practically it is very difficult to find. How rare are we talking here?   


Well [only 3 tons of iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium) are produced and consumed in the Earth's Crust annually.   


Gold is thus 40 times more abundant in comparison.   


What this means is that finding large quantities of this element is very rare, and when it occurs it is usually a big geologic deal. This is because large iridium deposits on our planet usually have an story to tell, as the element's presence is very much out of this world...",1,0,1563166123,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/cdd2ow/the_iridium_anomaly_and_earths_impact_events_both/

We don't see this, therefore it's reasonable to conclude that ID is a religious position driven by faith, not a position arrived at by evidence..",12,25,1563155738,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/cdbek7/are_their_any_nonreligious_proponents_of_id/

Here we go:

&gt; But everyone believes in Evolution...

&gt; ... and for about 10 years, everyone also believed in Elizabeth Holmes and her amazing invention. In fact, by the end of 2010, Theranos had more than **$92 million** in venture capital. You’d think that millionaires would be far more conservative with their money, opting to invest only in safe enterprises, but, hey, *everyone’s* saying that Theranos is the real thing, there’s no way all these important people are grossly mistaken, right?

&gt; *Mutatis mutandis*, the same reasoning applies to scientific dogmas, as is the case of neodarwinism. Every scientist professing to believe that random mutations, carefully tailored by natural selection, can account for molecules-to-man Evolution does not make it any more true. Just as every member of the emperor’s court was adamant in their admiration for the monarch’s new clothes, scientists don’t want to be the ones identified as “ignorant, stupid or insane”. We are all humans, after all, and that, like you or not, is human nature.

&gt; We live in a time of too much conformism; “science has already explained almost everything, we are just missing some details”, “you should not worry about this, people figured it out long go”, “scientists say...”, etcetera. Although these statements try to invoke the “spirit of Science”, they have nothing to do with Science itself, for Science, as brilliantly stated Dr. Feynman, “is a culture of doubt”, therefore, peeking behind the curtains in order to see what the Great Wizard of Oz is up to should never be disencouraged.

But one user, /u/gmtime, goes one step further and says creationists shouldn't use the terms microevolution and macroevolution, but should instead use the terms ""observed mutation"" and ""inferred mutation."" Why? [Let's let him speak](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etl7nnu/):

&gt; That seems like a reasonable differentiation. Though it will cause lots of confusion. I'd drop the term evolution altogether and talk about mutation instead. Then it becomes observed mutation and inferred mutation, which actually point out what you're trying to talk about.

/u/apophis-pegasus rightly [corrects this argument](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etlg0aa/):

&gt; Mutation is not evolution though. Mutation is a source of variation.

And gmtime [punts this awfully ignorant argument into the sidelines](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etllmn7/):

&gt; No it's not. Mutation is a gene changing in a way that it did not exist in the parents. Variation is a shuffling of the genes that do exist in the parents.

&gt; Example: a brown father with straight hair and a brown mother with curly hair get a brown kid with wavy hair is variation; the information for the waviness was already available in the parents. The same parents getting an albino kid is mutation; neither of the parents had genetic information that caused the skin to become white.

&gt; Evolution is the *theory* that a huge cascade of mutations will create all the different living organisms from the same (or same small set of) genetic root material.

&gt; Talking about micro vs macro evolution muddles the waters, because what's actually the question is whether (inferred) mutations actual do lead to evolution.

It's incredible that someone who knows nothing about biology is trying to argue that we should use new terms because ""evolution"" is confusing, all while not understanding how mutations, inherited traits, gene expression work, and also while arguing that mutations MAY NOT LEAD TO EVOLUTION!

DebateEvolution,ccx3rv,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,,"/r/creation: ""Behe Vindicated Again: Goldfish Are Broken Carp | Evolution News,"" or: How to lie to people who don't know much about science","Over at /r/creation, /u/MRH2 [posted about an article](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cck85k/behe_vindicated_again_goldfish_are_broken_carp/) from the creation blog [EvolutionNews](https://evolutionnews.org/2019/07/behe-vindicated-again-goldfish-are-broken-carp/) about the goldfish genome and how it proves Behe was right.

What might have happened to cause this blog post? What was Behe right about?

The first paragraph of EN's blog post ends with this sentence:

&gt; Darwin’s mechanism did not create anything new; it broke things, but in the case of the polar bear, it worked out.

The premise being that Behe argues that intelligent design and not evolution explains the origins of life better. Yeah, that's what this whole thing is about.

Behe's *Darwin Devolves* has this paragraph describing the book on Amazon:

&gt; A system of natural selection acting on random mutation, evolution can help make something look and act differently. But evolution never creates something organically. Behe contends that Darwinism actually works by a process of devolution—damaging cells in DNA in order to create something new at the lowest biological levels. This is important, he makes clear, because it shows the Darwinian process cannot explain the creation of life itself. “A process that so easily tears down sophisticated machinery is not one which will build complex, functional systems,” he writes.

In order to make this argument, Behe attempts to find ""devolution"" in nature, by claiming that ""DNA is damaged."" 

&gt; Although Charles Darwin didn't mention [polar bears] in his 1859 masterwork, *On the Origin of Species*, the polar bear is a wonderful illustration of his theory of evolution by random variation and natural selection. Like other examples Darwin did cite, the giant predator is clearly related to a species that occupies an adjacent geographical area, while just as clearly differing from it in a number of inherited traits. It is easy to envision how the polar bear's ancestors might gradually have colonized and adapted to a new environment. Over many generations the lineage could have become lighter in color (making the bears less and less visible to their prey in snowy environments), more resistant to the cold, and more adapted to the sources of food in the Arctic, a process in which each step offered a survival advantage over the previous one.

&gt; Yet a pivotal question has lingered over the past century and a half: How *exactly* did that happen? What was going on within the bodies of the ancestors of the modern polar bear that allowed them to survive more effectively in an extreme climate? What was the genetic variation upon which natural selection was acting? Lying hidden deep within the genome of the animal, the answers to those questions were mysteries to both Darwin and subsequent generations of scientists. Only several years ago--only after laboratory techniques were invented that could reliably track changes in species at the level of genes and DNA--was the genetic heritage of the Arctic predator laid bare. The results have turned the idea of evolution topsy-turvy.

&gt; The polar bear's most strongly selected mutations--and thus the most important for its survival--occurred in a gene dubbed APOB, which is involved in fat metabolism in mammals, including humans.^1 That itself is not surprising, since the diet of polar bears containts a very large proportion of fat (much higher than in the diet of brown bears) from seal blubber, so we might expect metabolic changes were needed to accommodate it.

&gt; But what *precisely* did the changes in polar bear APOB do to it compared to that of other mammals? When the same gene mutated in humans or mice, studies show it frequently leads to high levels of cholesterol and heart disease. The scientists who studied the polar bear's genome detected multiple mutations in APOB. Since few experiments can be done with grumpy polar bears, they analyzed the changes by computer. They determined that the mutations were very likely to be *damaging*--that is, likely to degrade or destroy the function of the protein that the gene codes for.

&gt; A second highly selected gene, LYST, is associated with pigmentation, and changes in it are probably responsible for the blanching of the ancestors' brown fur. Computer analysis of the multiple mutations of the gene showed that they too were almost certainly damaging to its function. In fact, of all the mutations in the seventeen genes that were most highly selected, about half were predicted to damage the function of the respective coded proteins. Furthermore, since most altered genes bore several mutations, only three to six (depending on the method of estimation) out of seventeen genes were free of degrading changes.^2 Put differently, 65 to 83 percent of *helpful, positively selected* genes are estimated to have suffered at least one *damaging* mutation.

&gt; It seems, then, that the magnificent *Ursus maritimus* has adjusted to its harsh environement mainly by degrading genes that its ancestors already possessed. Despite its impressive abilities, rather than *e*volving, it has adapted predominantly by *de*volving. What that portends for our conception of evolution is the principal topic of this book.

Except, as one would find with any person like Behe who routinely lies and gets caught lying, [he is outright lying about the studies done on polar bears](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/is-polar-bear-apob-damaged/5725) noting that their mutations biochemically damaged the genes or degraded or destroyed the function of the proteins.

So how does EN think that Behe was vindicated after lying about polar bears in his book that they're touting?

&gt; So how did the genes change? Chen et al. tell what they found about the goldfish genome in their paper in Science Advances, “De novo assembly of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) genome and the evolution of genes after whole-genome duplication.” There are four things a gene can do if it is no longer alone:

&gt; * Both copies can be expressed.
&gt; * Non-functionalization (non-F): One copy can go silent and not be expressed.
&gt; * Sub-functionalization (sub-F): It can take on one of the functions the gene formerly had.
&gt; * Neo-functionalization (neo-F): It can evolve a new function.

&gt; The first two responses involve loss. But what about neo-functionalization? That sounds like gain. It sounds like some new function emerges out of the idle code of the gene copy. Is that what they found?

&gt; ...

&gt; The authors mention “neo-F” 27 times, but readers will look in vain for the key evolutionary words innovation or novel, as in some new, novel function arising that did not exist before. The word gain appears 21 times, but 16 of those appear in the ambiguous form “gain/loss.” So which is it? The paper is filled with jargon and charts, but they obscure the question of what really was gained, if anything.

Yep, that's a blog supposedly about scientific topics complaining that a scientific paper is ""filled with jargon and charts"" and not using colloquial terms that they demand to hear. That's how you cater to creationists: be ignorant and be absurd.

Also, EN is arguing that if one of the copies is no longer expressed, or is expressed with the original, that's a loss of function. The gene isn't functionless. It's either working (both copies are expressed) or its regulator is inhibiting its expression currently (non-functionalization). Neither one of these is a loss of function.

It's worth noting that the paper also calls ""Both copies can be expressed"" ""conserved coexpression of the two ohnologs."" I'm not sure why they decided to use the terms for the other three and their definitions, but not for the coexpression term.

Anyways, EN continues:

&gt; It seems they were most interested in writing statistics about which genes got turned on or off (i.e., which genes were “expressed”). At one point, they say, “We did not distinguish between gain and loss.”

Why would the paper say that they did not distinguish? Because for the purpose of why they did not distinguish it simply did not matter. The full quote is:

&gt; Goldfish-zebrafish chain-net alignment (&gt;20 kbp) was divided into two different sets, each representing the alignment between the zebrafish and one goldfish ohnolog. Exons/CNEs from goldfish were liftover to zebrafish based on the two chain-net alignments and annotated using Exon/CNE information of zebrafish, and an exon/CNE was considered as a loss in goldfish (or a gain in zebrafish) if less than 0.5 of the Exon/CNE was mapped to the genome of zebrafish. CNE liftovered to exons was considered as an exon instead of a CNE. The same process was applied for zebrafish exons/CNEs. Exon/CNE triplets with one zebrafish ortholog and two goldfish ohnologs were identified and mapped to gene pairs, and only unique one to two gene pairs were retained for further analysis. CNE was assigned to its nearest gene within 5 kbp (this window cover most of CNEs). The number and length of exons/CNEs in seven configurations were counted for each gene triplet: (ZF,GF1,GF2), (ZF,GF1), (ZF,GF2), (GF1,GF2), (ZF), (GF1), and (GF2), where (.) means that the exon/CNE exists in the corresponding genes. Length was calculated according to ZF exon/CNE if the ZF exon/CNE exists, otherwise according to GF1. Percentage for each configuration was computed as the length of the configurations divided by the total length of all configurations of the gene. Exon gain/loss (difference) between any gene pairs in each gene triplet was computed from the seven configurations, e.g., Dpercent(ZF,GF1) = Percent(ZF,GF2) + Percent(ZF) + Percent(GF1) + Percent(GF1,GF2), where Dpercent(ZF,GF1) is the exon gain/loss between ZF and GF1, Percent(.) is the percentage of the configuration. **We did not distinguish between gain and loss.**

Here they're comparing CNE % changes between the three genomes they were measuring, regardless of whether the exon was missing or added. This was just a measurement of change across genomes, and did not impact their studies on whether gene functionality was gained or lost through the rest of their study.

Once again, creationists attempt to be deceptive to win points by quote mining and hoping their audience never bothers to check the source.

EN continues:

&gt; It sounds like, in the end, they are only repeating the evolutionary dogma that gene duplication gives Darwinism a chance to tinker and create novelty. Neo-functionalization “has been proposed to be a critical evolutionary phenomenon” that drives evolution. It would be “a useful case to explore this evolutionary process.” Wouldn’t they have highlighted a new gene with some new function if they had found one?

But the paper wasn't trying to find new genes to highlight. It was measuring exactly what the title of the paper says it was: ""De novo assembly of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) genome and the evolution of genes after whole-genome duplication"" Evolution of genes is simply their change over time.

To EN's blog post again:

&gt; Let’s look for natural selection. The word “selection” appears only 3 times in the text, but those refer to “purifying selection” (keeping things the same), “strong selection to maintain dosage balance” (keeping things stable), or “negative selection” (preventing changes). There was no mention of “positive selection” that would indicate something new or improved had arisen. Even the word adapt does not appear in the text, except in the references.

Because they weren't looking for something new or improved. They were just looking for changes and how those changes accumulated over time since the genome of the carp and goldfish had a duplication event. It is boggling that creationists refuse to see through this tripe.

EN continues:

&gt; “It would be easy to imagine,” in short, that gene copies “may” neo-functionalize. Science is supposed to proceed by demonstration, not by imagination. Even so, they are only imagining how the changed expression of existing genes could affect body form. Thus, goldfish are smaller than carp. Most of the known varieties of goldfish have arrived by human breeding, which is intelligent design.

Once again, we have creationists arguing that non-absolute words are in the realm of fairy tale thinking, rather than how science works. There aren't absolutes in science, and no one is going to state unequivocally that something is this way or something happened this way. These inconclusive terms are beneficial in that they show what the authors think happened **based on the evidence they have**. They can and should only form these conclusions based on all their available data and not based on what they hope is the result. Each time a creationist attempts to argue that a paper's conclusion is weaker due to terms like ""may"" and ""easy to imagine"" and so forth, they're hoping that you don't notice that no creationist has ever been able to bring up evidence and show objectively how it points to a creator's actions or a creator's existence.

EN rambles on:

&gt; Behe Vindicated

&gt; So how are goldfish like polar bears? They evolved primarily by loss.

Except the paper that they cited and their entire argument do not support this conclusion. Goldfish did not evolve primarily by loss. EN invented ways that they can state something is a ""loss,"" ignored all the times function was gained in the genome after the duplication because they couldn't find the terms ""novel"" and such, and rambled on about how a paper finding out how genomes changed over time couldn't cite any new gene functions that the paper never set out to find.

To me, this seems like science is vindicated against hacks like Behe, who even at the Dover trial had to admit that he makes up things just so his ideas have any merit. Hell, most of the Discovery Institute refused to testify under oath in support of intelligent design. Because EN's authors, like the rest of the DI, know they're lying to their readers and don't want to be hauled off to jail for perjury.

And finally, EN concludes:

&gt; Copy number variations do not add information. They just change the expression levels of existing information. By breaking or blunting existing information, polar bears get by in the white, cold arctic where the only thing to eat is a seal or fish. If that is what Darwin meant by natural selection, goldfish and polar bears will never evolve human brains.

Except that duplicating information is adding information, by definition. How can a new copy of a gene just be a change in expression level of existing information if the gene could coexpress, for example, or sub-functionality, where a gene expresses a different function it once had? How does one ""break"" ""existing information""? And only creationists would argue that anyone expects goldfish and polar bears to evolve human brains.

Well, it isn't. 

In order to be a scientific theory, as oppsed to a theory in the coloquial sense, or a hypothesis, or a guess, an idea must:

1) Explain observations. A scientific theory must mechanistically explain a wide range of observations, from a wide range of subfields. For example, relatively explains the motion of planets and stars.

2) Be testable and lead to falsifiable predictions. For example, if relativity is correct, then light passing by the sun on its way to Earth must behave a certain way. 

3) Lead to accurate predictions. Based on a theory, you have to be able to generate *new* hypotheses, experimentally test the predictions you can make based on these hypotheses, and show that these predictions are accurate. Importantly, this can't be post hoc stuff. That goes in (1). This has to be *new* predictions. For example, relatively led to a test of light bending around the sun due to gravity, and the light behaved exactly as predicted. 

4) Withstand repeated testing over some period of time. For example, a super nova in 2014 was a test of relativity, and had the results varied from what was predicted based on relativity, we'd have to take a good look at relativity and either significantly revise it, or reject it altogether. But the results were exactly as predicted based on the overarching theory. All scientific theories must be subject to constant scrutiny like this.

This is a minor update to the last section, in which /u/nomenmeum demonstrates he doesn't understand gene knockouts, irreducible complexity or scientific method, and insisted that a flawed experiment would be enough to prove the argument.

As well, he then neutralized one potential evolutionary pathway against his irreducible flagella by suggesting that the secretor system we think it evolved from could be a devolved version of the flagella, and that it is on us to prove that it isn't. Literally, he thinks that's a ""valid challenge to evolutionists"", creationists sure have it easy.

And no, that doesn't break irreducible complexity. Somehow. I think through self-delusion.

Has anyone ever noticed that none of these are new examples? It's always creationists citing some work they did in their glory days and then pretending that no one ever wrote scathing criticisms about them in the first place.

Anyway, now he's citing [this POS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2286568/) by Behe and David Snoke, in which they disprove evolution by claiming that a population count of 10^17 is a ridiculous figure.

You might recognize this article, it was involved in the ID trials back in 2005 -- yes, creationists are citing papers that have been pretty much debunked for over a decade -- at which Behe realized that while his God might be believed on faith, trials operate a little differently:

&gt;""A review of the article indicates that it does not mention either irreducible complexity or ID. In fact, Professor Behe admitted that the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were used.""

It seems like he might have been worried about perjury, because at trial, he had to admit that the conclusion he reached *might have been a little bit of a stretch*. It turns out he might have left out a few evolutionary pathways, and that 10^17 is actually a fairly small population --  that's actually only a few hundred liters of bacterial culture, which is not that unreasonable a thing on a planet this size.

Anyway, here's to 20 years of saying the exact same, discredited things and getting away with it, book by book, as creationists fail to realize Behe hasn't actually had to do any work in decades, except collect speaking fees for telling people what they want to believe.

I find that hard to believe and I'll list the points below.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Evolutionary Tree**

For example, evolution has a tree which represents all life on earth and the different branches show the divergence of life but whenever a paleontologist finds a new fossil, it generally leads to changing the tree to fit the new evidence. However sometimes another scientist will have a completely different view by comparing the fossil's anatomy with genetic evidence and sometimes they conflict. Then another event happens where another fossil is found which leads to the original tree being replaced with another one which fits the new evidence and of course not all scientists will agree and they'll have their own versions too. Of course it could be that we are continually improving on previous evidences and we are slowly getting there but saying 'the fossil record proves evolution' is kinda jumping the gun when you are still developing the evolutionary tree.

**Transitional Fossils**

Transitional Fossils are Fossils bridging the gap between different species of animals. Obviously there's a lot more to it than that but it's the general principle. Now fossils are rare therefore the fossil record is incomplete but I'm not going to focus on that. To explain, let's say we have 4 fossils, fossil A, B, C &amp; D. Fossil A, B and C have been discovered but D is yet to be discovered. Fossil A is dated at 3 million years, B at 2 million years and C at 1 million years. Fossil B shares 50% of it's characteristics of A and 50% of it's characteristics of C.  This is the current model of evolution for this situation;

*A evolves into B.*

*B evolves into C.*

Now in this situation fossil B is the transitional fossil and this makes sense. However now, fossil D is discovered and it has been dated to 4 million years ago and shares 100% of it's characteristics to B. Therefore the evolution model as shown above is thrown into disarray because why are we finding the transitional form from A to C, 1 million years before A comes into existence? Scientists can't ignore this therefore they have to change the Evolutionary Tree to fit this. This situation does happen quite often in Evolutionary Biology and I will show quite a common example, the Archaeopteryx (I'll refer to it as 'Arch').

The Arch is a species of dinosaur (there is a dispute whether it is a bird or not) and the first fossil was discovered at the time Charles Darwin published his book in 1861. This was hailed as the one of the first transitional fossils showing a transition between reptiles and birds but what is the consensus now? I have linked an article to Nature [here](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110727/full/news.2011.443.html) and it argues that the Arch was more closely related to the Velociraptor and probably isn't a bird. It says this because we have a greater understanding of dinosaurs and their biology and that we realized the Arch wasn't much different to a typical dinosaur. So what is the point here?

Well if we go back to the basic example of fossil A evolving into B and then B to C, we can think of fossil A as a reptile, fossil B as the Arch or the supposed transitional fossil and C as a modern bird. From our limited knowledge here, it makes sense that B is the transitional fossil. However once we discovered D which is a dinosaur that shares very similar characteristics to B before A even had evolved, it disproves that B is a transitional fossil.

This raises the question of what even a transitional fossil is. When you say something is in transition, you are saying it's changing from X to Y but how can you say something is in transition if you are not sure which one of the species is in transition towards the supposed species you are saying it evolved to? Now some say that because you can see lots of species sharing similar characteristics between point X and point Y, it suggests one of them must have evolved to Y but this is wishful thinking. How do you know that a species supposedly between X and Y isn't just totally independent of either and follows a completely different line?

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I conclude then that the statement 'The fossil record proves macro-evolution' isn't a valid statement. I can appreciate that the fossil record may support macro-evolution but saying it proves it is not provable at the moment especially when our view of life is constantly improving. It would be like you saw a man in location A wearing a red polo and some jeans and then you go on vacation to location B and you see another man wearing a red polo and some jeans and you say 'It must be the same man.' How can you say that for certain? To definitely prove the man is the same man, you need to get a good look at him to see if it's the same face and then talk to him and ask him if he was in location A and then you can determine if he was the same man.

I'm here to ask wether or not the evolutionary power that comes from mutations is actually more limited than often suggested, being more due to bringing out pre-existing abilities rather than making new ones. Excerpt here.

They found that “the evolutionary potential of a population **depends significantly**on its **preexisting** genetic diversity.” Selection of existing genetic variation is likely to swamp new beneficial mutations, because “**a high level of standing variation may allow a faster response to environmental changes than waiting for appropriate mutations to arise.**” Understandably so.""",3,6,1562297861,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c9b8xk/are_most_of_the_new_adaptations_actually_derived/

But this is a 180 from the truth.

Given a recent post there:

[Thoughts on ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" documentary/movie?](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c8ktvs/thoughts_on_expelled_no_intelligence_allowed/)

After a day, there are eight comments posted, six of which are visible (and two locked away awaiting moderator approval, most likely).

This is an echo chamber. Every post there, including one from a moderator of /r/creation, extol how great Expelled is, and how it proves that the scientific community conspires to keep creationism out of science.

Except that the farce of a movie lied to scientists to get them involved in the production, creatively edited their conversations so that it appeared that they supported intelligent design, and even fabricated or misrepresented what happened to creationists in the film.

Numerous sources have shown that the claims and misrepresentations in the film have no bearing on reality. This site compiles many of the links: https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/expelled-exposed/

Unfortunately, expelledexposed.com is down, perhaps because it's been 11 years since the film premiered and it's been destroyed one hundred ways to Sunday.

But here we are, an ""open debate"" subreddit praising a film that lies throughout, and not giving anyone the ability to point out how many things that the film gets wrong. It reinforces creationists' beliefs that their ideology is being censored in science unfairly and anyone who dares to question evolution is immediately shunned.

And the truth is far from that claim. How many people viewing that subreddit will get to know this? Not many. How many people will go to that thread and confirm their beliefs that scientists are afraid of creationism? Probably all of them.

This is why echo chambers are bad, and this is especially why /r/debateevolution is not an echo chamber. Bring to this subreddit your evidence for creationism or show verifiable evidence that evolution is wrong, and we will listen and scrutinize your claims.

But if you're just bringing the same tired arguments like what Expelled featured, yeah, we're just not going to deal with that. Why should we?

We have a creationist arguing that without every step of a process that we know can happen and can see examples of the various steps in other bacteria, then it's just a fairy tale and a faith-based claim. A rational person asks if the individual steps needed to go from the basic pieces to the fully-functioning flagellum were mapped out, would the creationist give up creationism?

One might think that there should at least be, ""I'd be willing to reconsider my beliefs"" since those beliefs partially hinge on this one item being irreducibly complex. Not with a creationist, though.

Look. We've been down the irreducible complexity rabbit hole several times. The problem is that, depending on how the concept is defined, it's either [irrelevant, unfalsifiable, or false.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61nda6/the_irreducible_complexity_is_not_a_valid/) Picking out an example where we don't yet have a step-by-step account of its evolutionary history doesn't change that. The way science, real science, works is you take a hypothesis and poke and prod to find a counterexample that falsifies it. If you can't, you can say ""hey, this might be true"".

Well, HIV-1 group M Vpu falsifies irreducible complexity. Lambda phage [falsifies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b01xml/novel_irreducible_functionality_in_lambda_phage/) irreducible complexity. 

You can throw around words like ""unreasonable"" or ""improbable,"" but to do so you must ignore the *actual examples of ""irreducible"" features evolving* that we've observed.

Oh? *Some* irreducible features can evolve, but others, like the flagellum, are too complex? That's an unfalsifiable argument from ignorance.

Footnote: The *E. coli* flagellum isn't irreducible; a step-by-step pathway to the present structure isn't the requirement to make that claim.

As far as I understand that simply isn't true what is selected for is whether the organism successfully procreated and their offspring survived to procreate etc.

Say for example you had a fly that lived for 18 months and only mated and layed eggs around the 12-13 month mark with the young being completely precocial. If there was mutation in an individual that shortened their life span to only 14 months the theoretical creationist may scream that it's a sign that the species degrading. Yet from a fitness point of view it's entirely neutral, it might suck for the fly but it was no less successful than it's 18 month old siblings. It may even be more successful because if the mutation becomes dominant in the population then the young have less competition for food.",19,7,1561779162,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c6tx23/trend_ive_noticed_of_some_creationists_equating/
DebateEvolution,c6ceiz,ThurneysenHavets,MA Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Possibly my all-time favourite C-14 dating graph. Young Earth Creationists, I'd love to hear how you explain this.","First, a bit of background. Ramsey et al. (2010) presents the results of the Oxford C-14 lab’s attempt to use radiocarbon dating to decide between various possible interpretations of Ancient Egyptian chronology.

For our purposes, however, it is more interesting to note that from the New Kingdom onwards, Egyptian history is actually rather accurate to begin with. It is pretty well fixed in relation to other chronologies, some of which can be pegged to astronomical events such as solar eclipses. This means that, rather than using C-14 to test Egyptian history, for the New Kingdom *we can also use Egyptian history to test C-14*.

For the non-Egyptologist, therefore, this article is a beautiful test of the reliability of C-14, and thus also of the dendrochronological record by which it is calibrated. Creationists are deeply sceptical of both. So here we have a testable creationist claim: if C-14 and dendrochronology are flawed we have no reason to suppose they will align well with known historical dates from the Egyptian New Kingdom, 3000 years ago (which is, after all, only about a thousand years later than the global flood).

[The graph shows otherwise]( https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AWUC_enBE803BE810&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=722&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=g0YVXezUJb2HwPAP-7yH6A8&amp;q=Radiocarbon-Based+Chronology+for+Dynastic+Egypt&amp;oq=Radiocarbon-Based+Chronology+for+Dynastic+Egypt&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24.39783.39783..40011...0.0..0.118.118.0j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz-img.1h3deCeCZdo#imgrc=Tz9T3LcYSD_ixM:). The correspondence between the mean radiocarbon dates and Shaw’s consensus chronology (the red line) is breathtakingly close – to a range of about ten to twenty years. That’s a margin of error of less than 1%. Even if you assume Shaw’s chronology is incorrect and take the competing chronology of Hornung et al. (the blue line) it doesn’t make that much difference.

I have a copy of Hornung et al. on my desk and their chapter on radiocarbon dating specifically states (p353) that their chronology for this period is established by regnal dates and astronomy *separately* to any secondarily corroborated C14 dates. So we really talking about an independent check here.

------

Why is this a problem for the creationist? Well, many of these methods stretch much further back than 3,000 years. Dendrochronology can be traced to the Holocene/Pleistocene boundary, twice as far as the YEC’s age for the planet. C14 can be used up to 75,000 years ago.

Creationists try to explain these problems by assuming, for instance, massive double ring growth for dendrochronology (ignoring the fact that double ring growth is actually less common than ring *skipping* in the oaks used for the Central European chronology, but never mind) or that C14 is somehow massively affected by the flood (again, ignoring the fact that even raw C-14 data still tags up pretty well – about 10% IIRC – with calibration curves). None of these solutions actually work, but ignoring that detail, here we have a nice proof that they have no practical effect on our ability to date stuff of a known historical age.

The only remaining option for the creationist, therefore, is to cram all the “wrongness” of the mainstream model into the few centuries between the flood and the New Kingdom. To assume that multiple methods which are spine-tinglingly accurate until the first millennium B.C.E. go completely and totally haywire in the centuries preceding, where we (rather conveniently for the creationist) can no longer test them against the historical record with the same degree of accuracy.

To me such an ad hoc assumption is even less believable than the already far-fetched YEC claims about dendrochronology and C14.

-----

Short addendum to this: I’ve just discovered, to my great amusement, that YECs have created their own C-14 calibration curve which fits with biblical chronology.

DebateEvolution,c4i3xh,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Dear Creationists: Please explain how abiogenesis is either impossible or so highly improbable to be impossible?,"Abiogenesis is not evolution, but creationists, especially at /r/creation, think that arguing against abiogenesis invalidates evolution as well.

So let's go with the question of this post:

Please explain how abiogenesis is either impossible or so highly improbable to be impossible?

It only becomes that once a person assumes that life must have arisen with absolutely nothing before it as a precursor. But we have viruses. Viruses have heritable traits. They replicate (through another host). They can evolve during their reproduction. But they are not alive. They're missing some key components of life.

So what's to stop a cell from being a non-living cell before it gets all the hallmarks of what we think a living cell needs to have? What if it has the cellular membrane? Heritable traits in the form of RNA or DNA? It absorbs proteins through its wall to help repair itself? It can get rid of waste through its membrane? And it can replicate by duplicating its genetic material and splicing into two?

What it can't do yet is metabolize for energy, still requiring it from an outside source. By what we know of living cells, this is not only an important aspect, but also required for what we consider ""life"" to have.

So it has all the components except for one for a living cell. Therefore, it's not one yet. Why do creationists think that this one-step-away non-living cell couldn't possibly have ever existed?

Why not two? Take away the cell replicating itself. And further down.

Each of these processes we observe in nature and in labs in far simpler constructs, even in non-living entities. Non-living cell gets a protein through its membrane that acts as a catalyst to start synthesizing replication of genetic materials? Now it can split into two. Non-living cell gets a tiny organelle that can convert a chemical process into energy for the cell itself? Now it can fully metabolize.

Steps, that's how evolution works, and that's what we're looking at when we study abiogenesis.

So, creationists, why do you insist that these steps can never happen or are impossible to exist? Why do you keep arguing that abiogenesis is so improbable or that it is impossible?

Please explain your position by arguing, with facts and reason, why the steps toward a living cell cannot have ever happened.",17,126,1561349851,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c4i3xh/dear_creationists_please_explain_how_abiogenesis/

It's an interesting take I think may be nice to have on hand when discussing Scriptural Inerrancy and Authority with any Christian, as well as the notion that our interpretations are never really set in stone. 

Whether religious or not, it's a fascinating read for anyone remotely interested in biblical interpretation.

I've pasted an excerpt below that I found neat:

""What about God's creative relation to the realm of organic things? Does the Bible provide any examples of God's *directly* creating living phenomena where scientists would now describe such origins *via* “naturally occurring” processes? Within the realm of living things, the Bible speaks of God *directly* orchestrating the events whereby each individual human being comes into existence. In Psalm 139:13–16, we read: “You knit me together in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made (*asah*)… My bones were not hidden from you, When I was being made (*asah*) in secret.” Again, Isaiah 44:24 declares: “Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and the one who formed (*yatsar*) you from the womb”; Isaiah 49:5 says: “And now says the Lord, who formed (*yatsar*) me from the womb to be His Servant,” and Isaiah 44:2: “Thus says the Lord who made (*asah*) you and formed (*yatsar*) you from the womb.” The Hebrew word “made” (*asah*) used in Isaiah and in the Psalms to describe the process of God creating or forming babies in the womb is the same word Scripture uses to describe God's creating or forming of lightning, the sun, and the stars. But, we might inquire, does God really *directly* create babies and form them in the womb? Do we really believe that God *directly* created each of us in our mother's womb?

According to science, the development of a human being in the womb is an exquisitely intricate and delicately organized phenomenon of which we know numerous details. “Development from zygote to embryo to fetus to independent animal is a dynamic and carefully orchestrated phenomenon that involves numerous simultaneous processes that occur in specific sequences and at particular times.”[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Ronald D. Hood, *Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology: A Practical Approach, Second Edition* (New York: Informa Healthcare, 2005), 154.View all notes Developmental biologists have uncovered many of the extremely complicated particulars of this process (called ontogeny) through which two single cells join and develop to become an extraordinarily complex multicellular organism called a human being. According to science, the formation of a baby in the womb is a *process* and *not* an instantaneous *event*. As everyone knows, fully developed babies are not created *ex nihilo* (out of nothing) at the moment of conception. If we believe that this developmental process described by science is how each human comes into being, and if we also believe that God directly creates each human person, then it would seem that God directly creates each individual human person through the biological process of ontogeny. Through the eyes of faith, we affirm that God is at work in every detail of this process—even though we can describe it with the help of science.

Having explored the language that Scripture uses to describe the ultimate physical origins of the things that science knows something about, we may go on to ask about the language that Scripture uses to describe the origins of things which occurred without leaving a directly observable record either in the present (e.g. ultrasounds of a developing embryo) or in the past (e.g. starlight from distant ancient galaxies). How did God originally create plant life? We read in Genesis 1:11: “Then God said, ‘Let the earth produce vegetation, plants yielding (*asah*) seed, and fruit trees bearing (*asah*) fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth’”; in Genesis 1:12: “And the earth made (*yatsar*) vegetation, plants yielding (*asah*) seed after their kind, and trees bearing (*asah*) fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.” Notice that the same Hebrew words (*yatsar*and *asah*), which are used to describe the process of a baby being formed in the womb and a star being formed, are used here to describe God's creation of plant life. If we are to interpret Scripture with Scripture, then this would imply that God created plant life through a process of some length rather than in an instantaneous event. Notice also that the grammatical subject in Genesis 1:12 that does the actual “creating” or “making” of the plants is the “earth.” This is not a novel observation, but one that goes back almost 2000 years into interpretive history. For example, Basil of Caesarea (c. 330) understood these verses as saying that God gave the *very earth* the power to create (*yatsar*) plant life.[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil, Hexaemeron 8:1.View all notes For Basil and other early Christians. God created creation to be creative and bestowed it with a good degree of autonomy.[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)See Christopher Kaiser, *Creation and the History of Science* (Eerdmans, 1991).View all notes Nature, says Basil, once created and put into motion, evolves in accordance with the laws assigned to it without interruption or diminishment of energy; and he compares the regular laws and cycles of nature to a spinning-top that continues in motion after the initial twist. Interpreting Genesis 1:11 *literally*, Basil says, “it is this command which, still at this day, is imposed on the earth and, in the course of each year, displays all the strength of its power to produce herbs, seeds, and trees. Like tops, which after the first impulse continue their evolutions, turning upon themselves, when once fixed in their center; thus nature, receiving the impulse of this first command, follows without interruption the course of ages until the consummation of all things.”[6](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil, *Hexaemeron* 5:10.View all notes

How then, according to Scripture, does God create animal life? In Genesis 1:24 we read “And God said, ‘Let the earth make (*yatsar*) living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.’ And it was so. God made (*asah*) the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.” And in Genesis 2:19: “Out of the earth the LORD God formed (*yatsar*) every beast of the field and every bird of the sky.” Here, the same Hebrew words (*yatsar* and *asah*) which describe the 9-month-long process of development from two single cells to a fully formed human being is used to describe the earth's creation of the different types of animals in direct response to God's command. Again, in the phrase “Let the *earth* make living creatures” (Gen. 1:24), we may ask: What is the grammatical subject of *yatsar*? *What* does the actual creating? According to Basil of Caesarea, God literally empowered (and continues to empower) the very Earth with the creative ability to produce such animals. Basil compares God's command to Earth to a ball that continues to roll down an inclined plane without further assistance. And he even describes the spontaneous generation of animal life from earth as a response to God's command: “God who gave the command \[to the Earth\] at the same time gifted the Earth with the grace and power to bring forth… even unto this day, some creatures, like insects and frogs, are produced spontaneously from soil.”[7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil *Hexaemeron* 9:2; Lactantius (c. 240–320) likewise did not discount the possibility that some animals could be spontaneously generated.View all notes

From a consideration of Scripture alone, then, it would seem that there must be something in the original creation of plant and animal life that is akin to the development of an embryo in the womb. We might wonder whether a scientific survey the evidence of Earth's past reveals any hint that the development of plant and animal life is analogous to the embryological development of an individual human being. Are *yatsar* and *asah* the *scientifically* appropriate ancient Hebrew words to describe God's creation of babies, plants, and animals? Scientifically speaking, the overall picture we get from the fossil record is that the emergence of plant and animal life happens through a sequence or a process where there is at first no sign of life, then single-celled organisms appear (prokaryotes—without nuclei), then eukaryotic organisms, and these are followed by more complex multicellular creatures (plants and animals). Under conditions that have existed on Earth for at least the last billion years, all living organisms appear to have arisen from previously living organisms in such a way that the present complex living forms have developed by an unbroken and continuous process from the simplest living forms of the pre-Cambrian era. In other words, in the emergence of plant and animal life through earth history, we find the same general trajectory as in the formation of an embryo in the womb: first single cells, then multicellularity, and then more complex organisms. *Yatsar* and *asah*, then, would seem to be the best words in Hebrew to describe the empirically observed process through which complex plants and animals are directly formed by God through time.""",0,7,1560496381,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c0h5sp/an_interesting_paper_that_explores_the/
DebateEvolution,c0h2tb,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Fossil Graveyards: How they Preclude a Global Flood and Young Young Earth Creationism,"As usual, the primary contender rising up and blocking Young Earth Creationism as a hypothesis with legitimacy is the dynamic duo of Geology and Paleontology. 

Which is why today we're discussing Fossil Graveyards, a type of Paleontologic formation frequently used *by* ""Flood Geologists"" in favor of Global Cataclysmic Flood. As we will see in the following post, this could not be further from the truth: the unique type of death assembly so cherished by those in favor of a Global Noachian Deluge directly precludes the event's existence. 

Let's dive in!

**Part 1: Taphonomy and The Types of Fossil Graveyard**

Taphonomy is a field in Paleontology that concerns itself with how things die. More specifically, the factors and events leading up to death (habitat and climate), burial/lack thereof (postmortem transport, decay, local scavengers) and fossilization processes (diagenesis and pressure). 

Naturally then, this science is really quite important to the realm of Paleontology and Geology (the latter insofar as the two fields can and do tend to inform one another).

But so frequently ""Flood Geologists"" will write on the subject as though mainstream Paleontologists and Geologists are completely ignorant of the processes that impact the preservation of life, while in the same breath providing hefty evidence they themselves don't know the first thing about it: 

*""When we see fossilization world-wide, when we note that the water is the agency that has presented the conditions for fossilization, then we must conclude that there was a world-wide water cataclysm in the past""* 

This is Randy Wysong, a YEC Veterinarian and Flood Geology Advocate. Not, mind you, a Geologist or a Paleontologist. If he were, he would notice the absolutely innumerable examples of arid fossilization, sometimes known as [desiccation](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/paleo/fossilsarchive/drydes.html). Or perhaps the preservation seen through freezing and encased in peat bogs and amber? Or perhaps the numerous trace fossils seen in gentle seafloor footprints. But Wysong continues: 

*""The geological column is not a record of the coming of life, it is a record of it's going, it's departure, it's demise. The scientific community is not naive to this evidence. Some simply shelf it or ignore it to maintain the doctrine of uniformitarianism.""*  

This prevailing attitude of ""Flood Geology"" is persistent among YEC's, interpreting nearly every fossil find dated from the Cambrian to the Cretaceous as a result of the Flood. [Gnawed-on bones](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/10/18/juvenile-dinosaur-ceratopsian-bite-marks/#.XQMyWIhKhEY) of a long dead cerotopsian or the tell-tale-teeth-marks of [cannibalistic theropods](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/teeth-marks-discovered-on-bone-fossils-show-dinosaur-species-was-cannibal-113508.html) must be ***uniformly reinterpreted*** to reflect an answer already in mind: a rapid death and burial by a catastrophic flood some 2000-4000 years ago.

This is all due to a lack of understanding, education or pure dismissal of Taphonomy. Of course, I imagine they would trust the same principles applied to a crime scene. 

There are Three Types of Fossil Graveyard, but all are used to make the same point by ""Flood Geologists"", that point being thus: The Flood buried these organisms. 

If the organisms are fragile and easily destroyed by rough water, the flood was so immensely fast and catastrophic it instantly buried these creatures, even as to preserve their finer features. 

If the organisms are jumbled in a mass and dis-articulated, well, the flood did that too: no truly natural process can explain the power with which these organisms were torn to shreds. 

You're probably wondering, can it be both? And as we will prove here in a moment: No. No it actually cannot be both. It can only be either, and only on a small scale. 

Fossil Graveyards come in three varieties: 

\- Localized Natural Traps which include tar pits, caves, fissures and dried up watering holes. These are the very local, and they are typically not the result of a ""one time event"".

\- Widespread Regional Accumulations are a result of climate or habitat and include lagoons, river deltas and steppe environments. These appear to map patterns in local change, such as an ephemeral lake or the repeated massing of frozen organisms in the cold. 

\- Truly Catastrophic, but Spatially-Restricted Death Assemblages occur when there is a massive impact on a moderately sized area. Volcanic Eruptions, Landslide and yes, Floods are included in this. 

But ""Flood Geologists"" appear to ignore the distinction, and lump ALL the categories into the big arching title: Fossil Graveyards. This is usually accompanied with the notion that these events are inexplicable under modern, natural conditions.

**Part 2: Why Ignoring the Distinction is Problematic to the YEC Cause**

**Let's reexamine the first category: Localized Natural Traps.** 

These have occurred throughout history, and are occurring today under very routine circumstances. Gary Haynes studied African Elephants in Zimbabwe and recorded enormous sites of pachyderm death and subsequent partial or total burial around watering holes. This is because African Elephants are quite intelligent, and dig primitive ""wells"" around dried lakes and ponds in pursuit of a drink. Many die as the water is present, but not abundant and creates mud-traps which the elephants cannot escape from. 

There is a similar assemblage in Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota, a dried lake with over 40 mammoth skeletons. 

Taphonomy is taking the former and realizing is is quite relevant to the latter.

Famous proponents of ""Flood Geology"" Whitcomb and Morris took this idea and ran with it in the opposite direction when examining the La Brea Tar Pits, another localized natural trap. 

It does not escape me that many modern proponents of the flood suggest a proto-pachyderm on the ark with mammoths and mastodons proliferating in hyper-evolutionary circumstances afterward. But this is a point being made against the due diligence of the very founders of modern Flood Geology. 

""One might, for example, discuss at length the marvels as the La Brea Pits in Los Angeles, which have yielded tens of thousands of specimens of all kinds of living and extinct animals (each of which by the unbelievable uniformitarian explanation, fell into this sticky graveyard by accident one at a time).""

Morris and Whicomb of course neglect to mention the lack of anything outside the proposed secular assemblage of ecology at the time (no pterosaurs or theropods are in the pits, for example).

And for those proclaiming this is not problematic for the modern ""Flood Geology"" which posits this tar pit is post-flood, well, that's not really going to work either. The specimens are radiometrically dated as 10,000 to 50,000 years old depending on the species (and [radiometric dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) has yet to be proven even slightly incorrect consistently) and the dark color of the bones found in these pits is due to long term soaking by the tar. 

Never mind the tar is gilsonite and crude oil... much of which formed after immense pressure and time from the Carboniferous to now. Proponents of the Flood already skirt Noah's use of tar to waterproof the boat by invoking the idea the Earth was created with the tar already formed. But what then, of La Brea? A Post-Flood Formation?

Localized Natural Traps are decidedly not catastrophic, and thus not a result of the Flood. 

**What about Widespread Regional Accumulations, the second category?**

Well they aren't really helpful to ""Flood Geologists"" either are they, given they reflect the changes across regions, not the world.

Take Solnhofen Germany, a famous fossil site covering 45 by 25 miles and 100-300 feet thick. It consists of fine-grained deposits, and incredibly well preserved organisms (even the ink sacs of squids) as well as toothed birds and the membranous wings of ancient pterosaurs.

So what do we know from the taphonomy? Well, plant life indicates this was an arid area and the fine grain size (1-3 microns) restricts the area to warm and quiet waters so the present lime particles can settle out given their precipitation rate of 1.5 X 10^(15). Preserved trackways of gently moving horseshoes crabs are also present, indicating very little current. But the key is the presence of coccolithiphorid algae remains, suggesting toxicity existed in the bottom layers thanks to algal blooms and subsequent eutrophic conditions. 

None of this is consistent with a global flood. And yet, the flood is invoked for the preservation of those fine feathers and wings, despite the fact that toxic lakes do the same thing to our organisms today. 

The Green River formation is equally problematic. It's assemblages reflect another ecosystem within the secular restraints something Whitcomb and Morris ignore in their book ""Fishing for Fossils"" instead opting to say:

""it is not easy to imagine any kind of ""uniform"" process by which this conglomeration of modern and extinct fishes, birds, reptiles, mammals, insects and plants could have been piled together and preserved for posterity.""

Except... all the forms were freshwater and appropriate for their time. There were no: trilobites, crinoids, mammoths, saltwater fish, dunkleosteans, smilodons, lobsters, dinosaurs or pterosaurs present. 

And so, in come the modern FG's with the idea that this too, is a post flood deposit. 

But... it's 2500 feet thick and 160 miles long by 60 miles wide with marls (fine grained mineral similar to lime). And one has 4000 odd years if working with a 6000 year time scale. With that deposition rate, does this at all sound possible? 

The Morrison formation and Florissant formation present similar issues. 

As is the [Karoo Formation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/azpl4p/the_karoo_formation_and_its_implications_for_the/)

**And that leaves the Truly Catastrophic, but Spatially-Restricted Death Assemblages.**

The problem should be immediately noticeable in the name: these are specially restricted, and invariably tied to local events. 

Take the Belmont Chert near Newcastle Australia. YEC buff Andrew Snelling loves to tout this area as evidence for the Flood, but a closer look (using our taphonomy knowledge) tells a different story. The Chert, 2.5 feet thick, is around 6 miles long by 1 mile wide and it is chock full of insects. Mostly their isolated wings, but enough has been preserved we now have identified 145 species. But there are ash layers, and coal seams present above and below the chert. And the fauna is limited to the insects and some off fish scales, crustaceans and plant debris. This screams local catastrophe, not global flood. 

Or the Ashfall Beds of Nebraska which show an impressive assemblage of Miocene mammals entombed in ash. Curiously, there is nary a trilobite present.

Finally the Lompoc Ditomite Layers which present an enormous death assemblage of pelagic (open water) fish... and enough algae fossils to choke out anything nearby with their algal bloom anoxia. 

Any of the [Global Extinctions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bbdxxz/the_major_extinctions_and_how_they_preclude_a/) will do as well. 

None of these shout to a global flood, but rather, the assemblages are forced into a jigsaw puzzle they simply do not fit to. 

**Part 3: Conclusion and TL;DR**

The Fossil Graveyards so often sourced by Flood supporters are not what they seem. They are rich beds of history whose true obituaries lie in their microfossils, ecologic assembly, death poses, and geology. And there isn't a single Fossil Graveyard, of any kind, that points to a global flood. The reason for this, is it is simply impossible given the number of Graveyards that point to the very opposite: local or regional events. Sometimes those events can snowball into mass extinctions sure, but one flood assembly points to a local flood. To have a Global Flood, well...

All the Graveyards would scream it, from their jumbled and disarticulated fossils to their distinct lack of arid conditions, anoxia or ashfall. 

But that, is simply not what we see.",21,13,1560495710,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c0h2tb/fossil_graveyards_how_they_preclude_a_global/
DebateEvolution,byteej,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,,"""Darwin Devolves: Introduction,"" or: How creationists believe any old nonsense that fits their beliefs...","/u/nomenmeum on /r/creation posted his quick review of Michael Behe's *Darwin Devolves*, a book that is scientifically inept with nothing worthwhile for anyone to read except those already in the creationist/ID camp. There's a reason why Behe doesn't write textbooks for the college or high school student; he writes for the crowd he knows will believe his bullshit.


Nomenmeum's review:

&gt; I'm reading Darwin Devolves by Michael Behe, and I thought it would be useful and fun for me to share some of my favorite parts as I go along. I don't intend to do a proper summary of each part, just to highlight what I thought was most interesting or insightful.

&gt; The first part is essentially a brief history of ID, beginning in antiquity. He notes, very rightly, that

&gt; ""all particular positions on the topic can be considered to be elaborations on either of just two general mutually exclusive views:

&gt; (1) contemporary nature, including people, is an accident;

&gt; (2) contemporary nature, especially people, is largely intended—the product of a preexisting reasoning mind.""

&gt; For me the most interesting part follows this. It is a short bio. He heads up this part by recounting a time when he

&gt; ""opened an academic journal called Biology &amp; Philosophy and spotted this sentence: “To see the point quite palpably, note that Stalin, or Osama bin Laden, or Michael Behe, or your favorite villain is also . . .” The man who included me in that rogues gallery was Alexander Rosenberg, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University.""

&gt; Behe's reasons for bringing this up are two-fold:

&gt; One, it is a typical example of the sort of socially sanctioned bullying that he and all proponents of ID are subjected to.

&gt; Two, it is the segue to the story of his journey to ID. What I found most interesting was that, being raised a Catholic, he had at first completely embraced naturalistic abiogenesis and evolution. Only after reading Evolution: A Theory in Crisis by Michael Denton did he realize,

&gt; ""I had never heard any of my teachers critique Darwin's theory in all of my science studies.""

&gt; He goes on to say,

&gt; ""At that point I concluded that I had been led to believe in Darwin’s theory not because of strong evidence for it. Rather, it was for sociological reasons—that simply was the way educated people were expected to think these days. My professors hadn’t been intentionally misleading—that was the framework in which they thought about life too. But from then on I resolved to decide for myself what the evidence showed. When one starts to treat Darwinism as a hypothesis about the biochemical level of life rather than as an assumption, it takes about ten minutes to conclude it’s radically inadequate. It takes perhaps another ten minutes to realize that the molecular foundation of life was designed..."" [Emphasis mine.]

&gt; Bonus: If anyone would like to see Alexander Rosenberg, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University taken to the woodshed, I suggest you watch him debate William Lane Craig.

First, the sentence used in the ""short bio"" comes from a philosophy of science journal, which is titled: ""Darwin’s nihilistic idea: evolution and the meaninglessness of life."" The paper discusses Daniel Dennett's use of the theory of evolution to explain how life is nihilistic. This paper was published back in 2002. The Dover trial started in 2005. So he was a giant dickweed even before he flamed out in spectacular style on the stand, apparently.

The entire paragraph of this quote to keep the context clear is:

&gt; &gt; Still owing us a naturalization of value or obligation, Dennett comes to the ﬁnal chapter of Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, where he again invokes his apt account of natural selection using cranes to lift lineages of biological systems and their traits through the subregions of design space to ones where good, better and (locally) best adaptations lie. The trajectory of this path through design space produced, among other things J.S. Bach, who is ""precious not because he had within his brain a magic pearl of genius-stuff, a skyhook, but because he was, or contained, an utterly idiosyncratic structure of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes."" But is it impertinent to ask why the fact that his genius is the result of cranes within cranes within cranes makes it precious? Surely the assertion without argument that its origins in the algorithm of natural selection make Bach’s genius precious to us or precious simpliciter is another instance of the genetic fallacy. To see the point quite palpably, note that Stalin or Osama bin Laden, or Michael Behe, or your favorite villain, is also ""an utterly idiosyncratic structure of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes.""

Out of context, it sounds like Behe is being compared to Osama bin Laden or Stalin, when he's in a list with those folks but is being compared to Bach, asking why Bach's brain at the end of his lineage should be considered precious, but why not bin Laden's, Stalin's, Behe's or a particular villain. In context, it's not as bad as Nomenmeum is making it out to be. And there's no bullying being done here; Behe is just a dishonest fuckup.

Then this argument:

&gt; ""I had never heard any of my teachers critique Darwin's theory in all of my science studies.""

Yeah, no shit. Teachers are there to explain the science and how a student can understand how we know what we know. Decent science educators don't waste valuable class time saying how wrong what they're teaching is (unless they're forced to teach nonsense because a school board or legislature has dictated nonsense be taught in a classroom). But evolution is not nonsense. So why would any decent teacher be knocking it in their lectures?

While we're at it, I've never heard any of my chemistry teachers criticize atomic theory in classes, therefore, I'm going to start believing in deistic-stickiness.

See how absurd that is? That's how fucking stupid creationists are, that this argument works for them when it leads people toward their belief system.

&gt; ""At that point I concluded that I had been led to believe in Darwin’s theory not because of strong evidence for it....""

Because Behe obviously didn't pay attention in his classes, or he's lying. There's no other explanation for this utter dishonesty. He's trying to sell books to gullible folks, so my money is on lying.

What are your thoughts?

As you can see, the argument settles down to, admit that there is design, therefore designer, or admit that there is a better design, therefore purpose, therefore designer.

Creationists refuse to do any of the work to support their ideas and present anything resembling science. All they have are logical fallacies and dishonest tactics to try to make their side have equal footing, or the win, in these discussions.

But the moment that you try to ask any of them about evidence for a designer existing, they run back to the same arguments that they used for design, then declare, ""There must be a designer!""

It's just pointless. Creationists know they're wrong and don't care. Creationists know that they can't defend their arguments without fallacies and lies and don't care. They know that they're not trying to convince the other person that they're right but trying to show others that their ideas have merit since they got to ""debate.""

No creationist deserves a debate about scientific topics. Pointing out that creationists are wrong about science when they make bad claims isn't debating them, but making it clear what their errors are.

If creationists feel that this is wrong, the entire scientific community is waiting for your answer to this:

What experiment, with control, can be setup to test the existence of the designer/creator, and what results should we expect from the experiment?

If you can't answer this, then start being honest and admit that the notion of a creator/designer in nature is 100% wrong.",26,45,1559927600,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bxx5mc/why_there_is_no_debate_to_be_had_between_rational/

*These comments are fascinating in their own right. Like C comments they have a start marker, like /\*, and a stop marker, like \*/. But they have some more structure.

DebateEvolution,bw2hrb,MRH2,,t2_8y18w,self.DebateEvolution,,Summary of responses to evolution and bad design,"A week ago I posted some questions on /r/debateEvolution to try and understand what’s going on with the idea of “bad design”.  It turns out that there is a wide spectrum of opinion among evolutionists.

* Evolutionists is a short form for people, many of whom are atheists, who believe that evolution explains how life came to be the way we see it now, the origin of species and all that. It’s not meant to be pejorative.


[The questions are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bt840r/confusion_about_evolution_and_bad_design/), abbreviated below: 

1. Does evolution automatically include the idea that nature is badly designed? Is the idea that nature is badly designed an intrinsic part of evolutionary theory? 
2. If you say that something in nature is badly designed, then one would expect that you could also detect the opposite. As someone who believes in evolution, is it possible to see things that are well designed as well as things that are badly designed? If not, why not?
3. Is everything in nature badly designed?
4. If not, can you give some examples of things in nature that we well designed?
5. If someone answers the above question and states some features of nature that are well designed, does this then mean that they are a creationist or does this mean that evolution is false? Do other evolution advocates see them as a traitor to evolution if they say that something is well designed?
6. Biomimetics is the field of engineering where we copy designs from nature to improve our products. If nature only has bad designs why would we be copying them? How do we improve our products by adding bad design to them?


## First of all, some universals:

We should all note that creationists have really poisoned the well on this one. A very common response is to have a knee-jerk reaction against the word “design”. Examples: 

*  Creationists don't usually debate in good faith and love to sneak in terminology in other descriptions
* Saying something is ""designed"" you are sneaking in a ""designer"" because design naturally requires a designer the same way a painting requires a painter, and that's why people are arguing with you.
* The term “design” is best avoided because it’s misleading; it suggests the existence of a designer that we don’t postulate.

Obviously, evolution does not believe in a designer. Hopefully we are all aware of that basic fact. However, I think that there is still reason enough to use word “design” and that, hopefully, we’ve progressed past the juvenile stage of “Hey, you said ‘design’, you must believe in God. Gotcha.”  If an ID-proponent wants to use this sort of argument, from ‘design’ to ‘designer’ then they should be up-front about what they are doing and how they are arguing.

Another universal: all the groups seemed to agree that if one of their colleagues used the word “design” when referring to nature, then that doesn’t automatically mean that they have abandoned evolution. This is a good and sensible response – even from the group who would not be caught dead using the d-word themselves.

## Here are the different groups, different viewpoints, that I’ve seen in the responses.

**Group 1.** There are a lot of evolutionists for whom the word “design” is a red flag and they absolutely will not use it because (for some people) it necessarily implies a designer. Thus, discussing whether a fingernail is well-designed or not is like asking if a fingernail is kyenwwmgo or quenglanckly.  

Dialogue? Any discussion about it is useless. But this is not a problem if someone in this group clearly states their position so no one is wasting time debating things that don’t exist.  Note that the person discussing with them has to be able to actually listen as well, in order to understand that this is the position of the evolutionist.

Logical contradictions: (i) none at all. Unless (ii) they are part of the group that argues that things are badly designed. Group 1 cannot say that anything is badly designed because they don’t believe in design and won’t use that word.

**Group 1b.** This group might be the same as the first. This group doesn’t believe in design, or in ever using the word design, but does not clearly state their position and actually tries to argue about design.  This ends up with a very confusing discussion with neither side able to understand the other. This seems to be the group that claims to not understand my questions (though they are straightforward), and when I reply to things, say that I obviously didn’t understand anyone’s responses. It’s very frustrating and reminds me of when a Hindu devotee was trying to explain Hinduism to me. I understood all of the words, but the sentences and the ideas made no sense to me. 

Dialogue? It’s a total waste of time discussion design with this group as no one will get anywhere.

Logical contradictions: If you don’t believe that ‘design’ can be used in a sentence referring to nature, then don’t argue about design. If you have some non-standard redefinition of ‘design’ so that you can use it when referring to nature, then you better make sure that whoever you are talking with understands this and can follow what you’re saying. It’s better to chose a word that reflects what you mean rather than redefining existing words.

**Group 2.** There are evolutionists who are able to discuss design in nature. This group is able to make the mental translation from “bad design” to “if this were a product of design, then it was done badly.” I’m not sure what the translation of “good design” would be.

**Group 2a** Their take is that there is no design in nature. No good designs, no bad designs.  (I’m not really sure if this should be group 2a or is just another facet of group 1.)

Dialogue? There doesn’t seem to be any point discussing design with them.

Logical contradictions: trying to talk about bad design when there are no designs in nature.

** Group 2b**. There are a LOT of evolutionists who talk quite vehemently about bad designs.  They seem to be able to use “design” in discussion and in making their points. However, they believe that everything is badly designed. There are no good designs in nature. Evolution automatically implies bad design. 

Dialogue? Since this seems to be a philosophical belief, it won’t be changed by any discussion or argument. Talking with these people is totally useless because they won’t acknowledge any points that don’t agree with their foundational a priori belief. You can’t change someone’s inherent belief by arguing with them.

Logical contradictions: (i) not being able to define bad design clearly (e.g. a bat flies but doesn’t have feathers, ergo, it’s a bad design. We only have one opposable thumb on our hand, two would be better, ergo, bad design). (ii) How can something be defined as bad if there is no good to compare it to? (iii) Biomimetics (question 6).


**Group 2c.** There is a group of evolutionists who can talk about design and also who do not believe that evolution automatically implies bad design. Yay! They will say that some things in nature are well designed and some are badly designed. They are able to look at design from an impersonal, detached viewpoint. They don’t feel the need to automatically start discussing the characteristics of the purported designer or bring metaphysics and religion into the discussion. Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed that they’ve given many actual examples of good design in nature, DNA and tardigrades are two that I’ve heard in these discussions.

Dialogue?  Great. This is the group that I would want to discuss design with.

DebateEvolution,buql1o,Volusia25,,t2_126yd9,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution and inherited disorders,"Probably a dumb question. But evolution is just survival of the fittest due to random mutations in alleles.   
E.g. they say Chinese ancestors lived in harsh, snowy conditions, causing them to squint all the time to prevent slow blindness. Ones who didn't went blind and died due to predators or lost their way etc. Those born with naturally slightly narrower eyes could prevent blindness, so over generations these random changes were passed down due to natural selection.  


Well the same should go for any inherited disease. Why do we still have people born with serious things like Type 1 diabetes or cystic fibrosis? Their ancestors would not have lived long, and so were less likely to reproduce and should have been killed of.  
Same with other things like people born with very bad eyesight. How did the ancestors live and breed, when they were almost blind and would be easy prey?  
A lot of conditions weren't even treatable until the past couple hundred years, so how could such a burden genetically survive and reproduce? Its survival of the fittest after all.

DebateEvolution,bu4h6t,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"No, Error Catastrophe Has Never Been Demonstrated Experimentally","Once again, r/creation is claiming that error catastrophe (genetic entropy to Sanford) [is a thing that has been observed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bs0mh1/a_debate_request_between_david_berlinksi_and/eosteff/), namechecking me where I can’t respond. 

So here’s my response. 

Before we get to the specific cases, I need to define a few terms. 

Error catastrophe: Harmful mutations accumulating within a population over generations, causing a net fitness decline below the level of replacement, ultimately resulting in extinction. 

Lethal mutagenesis: Inducing mutations in a population, resulting in extinction. 

Error catastrophe is a subset of lethal mutagenesis. In other words, error catastrophe is always lethal mutagenesis, but lethal mutagenesis doesn’t have to be error catastrophe. 

I also want to say that it’s crystal clear that error catastrophe has never been seen in natural populations, and while I think it *may* be possible that it can be induced experimentally, I’m becoming more skeptical the more I read and play around with the numbers, and I’m *certain* it has never been experimentally demonstrated. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s look at the supposed examples of error catastrophe in [this post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bs0mh1/a_debate_request_between_david_berlinksi_and/eosteff/) and see why none of them are actual experimental demonstrations of error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

1) Crotty 01 – This is always the go-to, but it ignores the [later work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483) by the same research group that documented at least five effects of ribavirin, none of which were controlled for in this study. So this work cannot be used to say ribavirin was used to induce error catastrophe; they’d have to repeat the work while controlling for these other effects. 

&amp;nbsp;

2) Loeb 99 – This is a really interesting one. The authors show that serial passaging of HIV in the presence of a chemical mutagen can cause extinction, but they’re very careful to use he term “lethal mutagenesis” rather than “error catastrophe” to describe their findings, because they didn’t demonstrate a correlation between mutation accumulation over generations and fitness. So while error catastrophe may have occurred here, the authors did not actually demonstrate that this was the case. 

&amp;nbsp;

3) Sierra 00 – This study shows a decrease in fitness during mutagenic treatment of a virus and occasional extinction, but the authors point out that small population size (i.e. genetic drift) also contributed to extinction – they only observed extinction when the treated population were diluted, i.e. when the researchers artificially reduced their size. 

&amp;nbsp;

4) Severson 03 – Uses ribavirin, does not control for the other mechanisms of activity. So while this may be error catastrophe, we can’t draw that conclusion without better-controlled follow-up work. 

&amp;nbsp;

5) Fijalkowska 96 – Shows that E. coli require the proofreading subunit of their primary DNC polymerase, and the authors suggest, but do not demonstrate, that inviability without the subunit is due to mutation accumulation. A reasonable hypothesis, but they do not support it with the data in this paper. 

&amp;nbsp;

6) Contreras 02 – This just shows that ribavirin is mutagenic in HCV. They discuss the *possibility* of error catastrophe, but didn’t document it.  

&amp;nbsp;

7) Crotty 00 – This is just shows that ribavirin in an RNA mutagen. This same team said in source number 1 above that error catastrophe had not yet been demonstrated, which means the people that wrote this paper say it doesn’t demonstrate error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

8) de la Torre 05 – This is lethal mutagenesis but not error catastrophe. Figure 2 shows this pretty clearly. To clearly demonstrate error catastrophe, they’d have to do measure burst time before treatment, then sample between *each* burst and demonstrate a decline over generations. The data right now don’t show that. 

&amp;nbsp;

9) Ahluwalia 13 – Doesn’t show a decrease in fitness, just an increase in mutations. The authors are using the term “error catastrophe” to describe something that is very much not error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

10) Day 05 – Uses ribavirin, doesn’t control for the many activities of ribavirin. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, I’m not saying error catastrophe can never happen. I’m saying it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Each of these papers has a deficiency, in what was measured, in the experimental controls, or just plain being not relevant to the question, that makes it not a demonstration of error catastrophe.",25,255,1559072405,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bu4h6t/no_error_catastrophe_has_never_been_demonstrated/
DebateEvolution,btot5o,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Coral and Coral Reefs Preclude a Global Flood and Young Earth Creationism,"Today's subject is that of the one of the most basal organisms on our planet, and it is capable on it's own of disrupting the possibility of a global flood as well as a 6000 year old Earth. It also validates Evolutionary Theory and the currently listed mass extinctions. 

It may be a simple cnidarian, but we'll explore just how damaging this animal is to a literalist interpretation of the Bible. 

**Part 1: The Crash Course on Corals**

Corals are marine invertebrates of the phylum Cnidaria. They are sessile, meaning they lack a means of locomotion, and individual corals (polyps) form coral groups known as colonies, whose polyps are thus genetically identical. They reproduce primarily sexually though, and coral colonies will release gametes into open water simultaneously according to the lunar cycle. 

As such, coral reefs are made of many coral colonies which many vary on species, but all of which grow upwards and outwards asexually. In the case of stony coral (as opposed to the other type, soft coral) their immense skeleton is made of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite (both polymorphs of limestone).

Coral reefs are interesting though, due to their nature of growth. As coral reefs proliferate, coral groups die and are replaced by new polyps. This leads to a continuous growth of new coral colonies on the dead skeletons of their colonial fore-bearers. 

In fact, the largest reefs on our planet are living coral groups on thousands of years of dead coral groups including the Great Barrier Reef. 

The coral type we are going to investigate here is that of large stony corals (scleractinian) which build  shallow-water coral reefs, including fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; the majority of which occur in tropical and subtropical seas. This is because these particular corals are not only incredibly common, but they are of interest thanks to their abysmally slow growth rate adding an [average of 0.2-1.0 inches per year to the overall height of the reef.](https://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/) 

According to this same source corals have ideal growing conditions that apply generally across the board: "" Coral reefs grow best in warm water (70–85° F or 21–29° C). Corals prefer clear and shallow water, where lots of sunlight filters through to their symbiotic algae. It is possible to find corals at depths of up to 300 feet (91 meters), but reef-building corals grow poorly below 60–90 feet (18–27 meters). Corals need salt water to survive, so they grow poorly near river openings or coastal areas with excessive runoff.""

All of the following will be important to remember and refer to for the following analysis. 

**Part 2: A History of Corals**

Geologically, we first see corals appear in Cambrian rock, although their record really begins to bloom in the Ordovician. Here we see the rise of the incredibly prolific [Rugose Corals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugosa).

They are represented heavily in the Thorton Reef  in Illinois at the Silurian Racine Formation, where ancient reef cavities are filled with thick oil, and layering is interspersed. The Devonian Tract in Alberta is similar. 

These corals no longer exist today, as they were wiped out in the Permian, leaving an enormous void in the fossil record. But shortly after in the Triassic the scleractinian corals arrive on the scene, and become the dominant corals we see today. 

This is important: Prior to the extinction of the Rugose corals, we *never* see a scleractinian specimen in the fossil record. It isn't until the rugose niche opens up that the scleractinians can diversify into their spots. This is **not** to say that scleractians did not exist before the Triassic, but rather, they were represented by much fewer species due to competition with the rugose corals. In fact, current [molecular data](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-316) suggests that scleractinians were out and about deep in the Paleozoic, but their radiation was choked by the sheer success of the rugose species. 

The shoe would be on the other foot though, as the anoxic conditions that obliterated the rugose corals could not squelch the scleractinians, who had been quietly subsisting in the background. They would explode in diversity in the Mid-Triassic once a symbiotic relationship with algae was developed. 

**Part 3: Corals Confound Creationists**

So hopefully you're already seeing the problems, but let's point them out and dive in a bit more. 

 **Rugose Coral Reefs bust up a Global Flood AND a Young Earth**

Flood Geology generally has the first layer of the flood deposits as that which overlays the basement granite of our planet, or layers corresponding to the Pre-Cambrian. In the context of the Grand Canyon, this would be the Grand Canyon Supergroup as the first. 

Now, as we mentioned above, Thorton Reef is a Silurian Reef, and the Silurian begins some 443 MYA. This is certainly smack-dab in the middle of the Flood Layers. 

Thorton Reef is a remarkably intact reef, with incredibly preserved brittle coral heads, crinoid fossils and other fragile organisms. But it is located in a layer that would have been deposited in the *very heat* of what is considered by Creationists as the most powerful natural disaster of all time. 

But somehow we are expected to accept an enormous global flood that instantly buried some organisms, and tore other apart (depending on the state of the fossil examined), *raged for months* without burying an enormous reef, and then, midway through, covered it instantly without it's earthshaking power obliterating all the fragile bits. 

The Rugose corals too are slow growers and make up an enormous tract of land in the [Devonian formation in Alberta](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249890738_Tectonic_Control_of_Devonian_Reef_Sedimentation_Alberta_ABSTRACT): ""...the Upper Devonian Swan Hills Formation of the Beaverhill Lake Group. Kaybob reef is a flat north-south elongate lens, 250 ft thick, 11 mi long, and 3 mi wide, built on the Slave Point Formation, a widespread platform carbonate.""

It is far too large to have formed in less than 3000 years from Creation to the Flood, even using the most liberal Creation date by YEC's of 10,000 years. 

Add to this the trouble of the flood wiping out all corals, due to their requirements clear shallow water and low turbidity (rugose corals are shown to require these as well, given the shaping of the Thornton Reef) and all current reefs then having a maximum age of 4319 years (presuming the flood was in 2300 BCE)

**And Modern Corals do the Same.**

Take the [Enewetok atoll.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enewetak_Atoll) This atoll was [cored](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0260y/report.pdf) many decades ago, and indicated that it is an enormous coral reef growing on volcanic rock. As the volcanic rock sunk (as some do) the coral was forced to grow upwards in order to maintain proper  conditions. This is  similar to how trees grow towards sunlight. And it created a massive slab of coral around 1380 meters thick, nearly a mile. The deepest parts were so old, that the aragonite skeletons of the coral were geochemically converted to dolomite. 

Let's give Creationists the best possible scenario and assume all these corals are growing at the fastest known coral growth rate of 8 inches per year. To be clear, we know that these corals abide by the far more common growth rate of 0.1-1.0 inches per year, but we're being generous. 

A depth of 4540.8 feet X 12 inches / 8 inches per year yields an age of 6811.2 years. nearly 3000 years too old to have begun growing before the flood, and using the most generous possible growth rate, applied to corals who definitively do not grow that quickly. 

The more realistic math using these species actual growth rates gives the atoll a minimum age of 138,000 years old, and that is still eliminating any erosional events in the core sample.

Coral Reefs line Enewetok or the Great Barrier Reef are ignored though, or spun to fit the narrative as in [this link](https://www.oldearth.org/rebuttal/magazines/Creation/1985/article_v8_i1_great_barrier_reef.htm), where Old Earth Ministries busts YEC authors Snelling and Reed for misrepresentation, or, dishonesty. 

Sometimes in an effort to explain this, Creationists invoke that the ancient coral colonies such as Thorton did not grow in one place, but are a result of many colonies that grew in separate places and were transported to a new location by the current, and subsequently buried. 

Of course this brings us right back around to the problem of the fragile corals and other organisms, as well as the orientation of the reef itself. If it were carried by strong currents and placed elsewhere it should be heavy-side-down. But the heavy part of the reef, the enormous upward growth, is facing upward as it would if it had never been moved. 

And so, Creationists are left with either invoking coral growth faster than ever before seen (which is not empirical) or suggesting physics defying currents, which have also never been seen. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

Corals are incredible animals whose appearance, diversification and persistence in the fossil record aligns not with sudden Creation but with Evolutionary Theory given the succession of Rugose corals by Scleractinians. Additionally, their growth rates even at their most generous preclude the traditional YEC timeline both in modern reefs and ancient reefs. This leaves Creationists dealing with the coral issue by ignoring it or invoking never-before-seen physics and biologic concepts.",34,21,1558978456,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/btot5o/coral_and_coral_reefs_preclude_a_global_flood_and/
DebateEvolution,bt840r,MRH2,,t2_8y18w,self.DebateEvolution,,Confusion about evolution and bad design,"I'm confused about evolution and bad design

I'm not sure that I'm really understanding how evolution and bad design are connected. There have been some vehement conversations about bad design and I don't understand why this is happening, so I have some questions so that I can understand the evolutionary viewpoint better:

Does evolution automatically include the idea that nature is badly designed? (By nature, I mean things like breathing, toe nails, teeth, scales, organs, organisms, ...) Is the idea that nature is badly designed an intrinsic part of evolutionary theory?

If you say that something in nature is badly designed, then one would expect that you could also detect the opposite, something ""not-bad"". As someone who believes in evolution, is it possible to see things that are well designed as well as things that are badly designed? If not, why not? 

Is everything in nature badly designed? 

If not, can you give some examples of things in nature that we well designed?

If someone answers the above question and states some features of nature that are well designed, does this then mean that they are a creationist or does this mean that evolution is false? Do other evolution advocates see them as a traitor to evolution if they say that something is well designed?

Biomimetics is the field of engineering where we copy designs from nature to improve our products. If nature only has bad designs why would we be copying them? How do we improve our products by adding bad design to them? (Examples of biomimetics: velcro, lotus-inspired hydrophobic surfaces, fog-harvesting from beetles, sharkshin surfaces to reduce drag and fouling in hulls, dry adhesion by gecko toe pads.)  _I know that people can detect bad design because there's a whole subreddit about it: /r/crappydesign  QED ;)_

I'm asking these questions because of baffling posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/atnjse/what_would_intelligent_design_actually_look_like/eh2foue/). He bascially says that any concession that something in nature is designed means that you are admitting the God exists and is the designer. I don't see this at all. I don't follow that ""logic"". I don't assume that you have abandoned atheistic evolution if you say that something is well designed (hopefully this will be discussed in the question about traitors above). From what I can see, working through the questions above should lead one to be able to state that there are some parts of nature that we well designed (e.g. photosynthesis or DNA or something).  So what does everyone else here think? Do all you scientists who have spent decades studying biology and evolution think like /u/cubist137 or do you see that some things in nature are well designed?  I'd like a little clarity.

_P.S. Just in case you can't follow my reasoning, I am most emphatically not arguing that everything in nature is well designed (ingrown toenails and varicose veins are a huge pain). I am also most definitely not arguing that God exists, that God is the designer or any sort of other crazy stuff. I am not arguing that feature X is well designed either._",3,77,1558878544,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bt840r/confusion_about_evolution_and_bad_design/

You've likely seen the ones involving:

 The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics: ""Evolution violates the *fact* that everything proceeds towards entropy."" A false argument, as it ignores the nature of Earth as an open system. 

Abiogenesis: ""Evolution has problems from the get go, no one has proven abiogenesis can happen."" The two are entirely different fields, and this statement shows a classic lack of understanding of *what evolution even is:* Change in allele frequencies in populations over time.

And another classic: Transitional species do not exist, or if they do, there are not enough of them. 

The latter is the focus of this post: Many Creationists lack an understanding of the nature of taphonomy, fossilization and life assemblages, which is essential for interpreting transitional forms. Many expect stepwise representation of literal lineages, and worse, they fervently presume this is what evolutionary theory predicts we should find. 

It is at this point you might grow frustrated, as someone who has looked into this even remotely understands this is the antithesis of the predictions evolutionary theory, taphhonomy and paleontology make. And yet it is proposed as a strawman to take down in order to make the fields appear unsteady. 

Enter a lovely blog by a Theistic Evolutionist aiming to clear the air. [Letter to Creationists](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/) is written by Dr. Buchanan, an individual with some interesting education and experience:

""B.A. in Near Eastern Studies, a year at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and a year working as a plumber and a lab technician. Then a B.S.E.  and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Since then, have conducted research in an industrial laboratory. Published a number of papers on heterogeneous catalysis, and am an inventor on over 100 U.S. patents in diverse technical areas."" 

And they've written [This](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/realistic-expectations-for-transitional-fossils/) article titled ""Realistic Expectations for Transitional Fossils"" an excellent piece that lays out a couple of things: 

**The Key Factors Governing the Fossil Record**

**Expectations for Fossil Lineages**

**Do Transitionals Prove Evolution?**

**Skepticism**

**YEC Underlying Problems**

He gets into quite a bit of Theology, but the purposes of this post are to analyze what the professionals actually expect of transitionals versus the what Creationists put forward as what is expected. Because as we will see they are quite different.  Only some of the above will be covered here so I recommend you read the article. 

**Part 1: Creationists versus Everyone Else** 

It is well known by the general public that conventional science says we have an absolute myriad of transitional forms. Creationists (YEC and OEC alike) disagree, obviously. And in a conversation with one or many, you might go through what is a very similar path as the Narcissist's Prayer: 

 **""Transitional Fossils do not exist.** 

**And if they do, there's no way of showing the species are related morphologically.** 

**And if there is, there's no way evolution can occur that quickly.** 

**And if it can, here's a fossil for your particular lineage that's problematic.**

 **And if it's not, Scientists are biased.""**

This usually comes from people who lack an education in any of the fields involved (biology, paleontology, taphonomy, geology etc) who for some unknown reason thinks that their idea of Common Sense trumps the education and experience of *thousands* of scientists through the years. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it comes from someone who does have some training, and it is there that we find many of the scientists working for the YEC websites such as AiG or ICR. 

Those in the second grouping are certainly convicted. But the strange bit is you will rarely find a Creationist Paleontologist. In fact, I don't even know of a single one. This is because when a religious person is educated, they *tend* to abandon their faith, or adapt it. Mary Schwietzer and Jack Horner are both fervent Christians who are Theistic Evolutionists, for example. 

Essentially we have a scenario where the overwhelming majority of scientists (and according to [polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx), Americans in general) [accept Evolution](https://rightingamerica.net/the-evolution-of-creationism-in-american-higher-education-part-1/) and the Antiquity of the Earth, and they are challenged by a comparatively small fringe-group with a much poorer showing of college graduates (highest percentage of Creationists is in the bible belt, lowest consistent [advanced degree acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment) is there as well).

And here is where we see an objective example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect: People who know less comparatively, think they know more. These groups assert they see common sense truths where people who have spent their entire lives training and working in the fields of evolutionary biology simple do not. 

And this, is problematic. It is the reason for the strange mantra about transitional fossils listed above. So how can things be cleared up? By talking about it. Challenge ideas and let your ideas be challenged, and most importantly one cannot fear the truth. 

Let's look at the truth regarding transitionals.

**Part 2: The Truth about Transitionals**

In science in general, the evidence makes or breaks the hypothesis. As such, the evidence *must always* support the conclusion, or theory/law, by definition. 

As such, ""transitional fossils are a significant part of the evidence for or against evolution. It is necessary to have a correct understanding of the nature of transitional fossils, in order to properly evaluate the physical evidence. ""

So Dr. Buchanan lays out the key factors that must be considered:

 

 **(1) The fossil record is inherently very sparse.** Very, very few of all the organisms that have died in past eons become fossilized.  As we can observe today, nearly all carcasses rot or are eaten by scavengers rather than being buried intact in rock layers. Of the remains that do get fossilized, many are later eroded away if the rocks in which they are embedded are raised above sea level.  If these rocks become deeply buried, the fossils can become smeared beyond recognition in metamorphic transformations. This is even more of an issue for older rock layers, such as the Paleozoic era (Cambrian through Permian periods), since they have had more time to be either raised up to the surface for erosion or to be buried more deeply.  Also, of all the potential fossil-bearing rocks, only a small fraction is available in surface exposures for paleontologists to examine.

As [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_record%20) points out, “The number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.”    No fossils have yet been found for about a third of the 30+ phyla of living animals.  Occasionally (e.g. once every 15 million years or so) we find a rock formation such as the Burgess Shale where conditions were just right to preserve a rich assemblage of fossils (including many soft-bodied animals) in that locale at that snapshot in time.  These “Lagerstatte” are the exceptions which prove the rule: they confirm that the ancient seas were teeming with diverse life-forms, but in most times and in most places (i.e. apart from these very rare fossil-rich formations), these organisms simply did not become preserved as recognizable fossils.

The Coelacanth order of fishes furnishes a classic example of the fickleness of the fossil record. These fish were once widespread in the ancient seas. Coelacanths peaked in the fossil record about 240 million years ago, and then declined. The most recent known fossil dates back to about 80 million years ago. It was thought that they had become extinct. In 1938, however, a live coelacanth was discovered in the Indian Ocean. Since then a number of others have been caught.  Unless we are prepared to claim that an Intelligent Agent supernaturally re-created these modern coelacanths, *we must acknowledge that some population of these fish has existed for the past 80 million years but* *without leaving a trace in the fossil record.* 

We should expect to observe many gaps like this in the fossil record.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_taxon) is a list of other “Lazarus taxa” which disappear from the fossil record for millions of years, but appear again later.

**(2) New species tend to develop in small, isolated populations**. The arithmetic of basic population genetics shows that it is more difficult for new genetic mutations to become established in very large populations, than in small populations. This is readily confirmed by laboratory studies. For instance, [Perfeito et al](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5839/813.short). found that new beneficial mutations were much more readily established in small populations of bacteria than in large populations.

Thus, it is far more likely that a new species would develop within a small, isolated population, especially if that population is under some environmental stress that would favor genetic changes. The odds of us finding fossils from that small, localized population is are nearly zero.  If the new species becomes more fit than the old species, the new species will expand, and only then is likely to appear in the fossil record. But once a species is widespread and successful in its ecological niche, there will be diminished selection pressure for changes, so fossils of this now well-adapted species are likely to appear for perhaps million of years with showing little change.

**(3) A given population can persist for many millions of years with little morphological change.**  As demonstrated by the longevity of the coelacanth group, a specific type of organism can persist for tens of millions of years with only modest changes.  Thus, if we find a fossil of some species in rocks dated as being, say, 100 million years old, it is quite possible that a similar, related species (same genus or family) also existed 110 million years ago, and maybe even 150 million years ago, whether or not we have found these older fossils yet.  For instance, the past 80 million years would constitute such a “ghost” lineage for coelacanths.

 **(4) Evolutionary lineages tend to be “branchy”.**  Typically what shows up in the fossil record are organisms on the side branches, rather than the directly ancestral ones along the main “trunk” of the family tree. These side branch species often show intermediate features, but are not the actual transitional fossils.""

And so, it is important to remember the bushy nature of life, taphonomy and fossilization. Even though we have what appears to be a concise and stepwise transition of forms, general forms can persist past their progeny's emergence and forms are likely not truly direct, but rather depict a gradient of traits appearing and overall evolutionary trends.

**Because that is the key part so many creationists miss out on: a primary use of transitionals rests on their ability to track the emergence and persistence of varying  morphologic traits through geologic time.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: The Truth about Lineages** 

Dr. Buchanon lays out the major differences in what Creationists expect from the fossil record, versus what the actual science has *always* expected. 

""Figure 1 represents a naïve expectation of what the fossil record should look like for the evolutionary family tree encompassing some species **A** through **D**. In this figure, there is a single lineage, with the direct ancestors all appearing as fossils.  Each earlier form neatly disappears from the fossil record as the next one appears, so there are no overlaps. From the four factors discussed above, it is obvious why Figure 1 is not realistic, yet this is what YE creationists often demand to see.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ddhqn8oqzny21)

 Figure 2 shows a more realistic fossil lineage. The points of actual divergence (common ancestors) are relatively unlikely to have left fossils. It is more probable that we will find fossils of successful populations on the side branches of the family tree, such as **B** and **C** in this figure. This is not due to some weakness in evolution. Rather it is due to the intrinsic nature of speciation and fossil preservation (branching, new species arising in small populations, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](bcbt5jpvzny21)

 Figure 3 below better represents the type of fossil pattern we expect from what is known about speciation and fossilization: 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](to71u3450oy21)

 

A possible family tree for these fossils is shown above in Figure 4. The thick lines denote the observed fossils, with the thin lines denoting inferred lineage relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](iszsjema0oy21)

 The little changes from one species to the next are not accessible, and direct lineal ancestors are typically not found. However, for a typical major transition a range of “cousin” fossils are found which manifest key intermediate characteristics, in the appropriate time range for that transition. For most objective observers, this constitutes strong supporting evidence for evolution.  It certainly shows that the fossil record is not a “problem” for evolution. ""

And this above, is the crux of it. 

**Part 4: These Expectations Have Never Been Different**

So often ""Origin"" is the only science held to impossible standards by Creationists. They do not ask the same of other branches. And occasionally it is proposed that because evolutionary theory changes to accommodate new evidence (you know, as all science should) it is wrong. Mind you, the core proponents have never changed: Allele frequencies change in populations through time. Full stop. 

But yes, sometimes aspects of the science do change. However, Darwin said his peace on transitionals in the very beginning, proving just how warped ""our expectations of these fossil lineages"" presented by Creationists are: 

 ""*As the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations,* ***we ought not to expect to find****, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two formations,* ***all the intermediate varieties between the species*** *which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods:* ***but we ought to find*** ***after intervals, very long as measured by years****, but only moderately long as measured geologically,* ***closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these assuredly we do find****.* ***We find****, in short,* ***such evidence*** *of the slow and scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms,* ***as we have the right to expect.""***

And Buchanan then notes "" The fossil record is clearly compatible with evolution. Indeed, the same can be said for all physical observations, in geology, biology, chemistry, and genetics. The hard reality, though, is that a dedicated YE creationist will not be convinced of macroevolution by any physical evidence. *No matter how many fossil intermediates he is presented with, he will always find a way to wiggle out.*  He can say, “Yes, there is a sequence of fossils with gradually varying characteristics, but you can’t *prove* that one evolved into the next; you are just assuming evolutionary relationships among them.” Or, “How do you know that God did not miraculously create these species in this sequence?” 

You can lead an eohippus to water, but you can't make him drink.

**Part 5: Conclusions and TL;DR**

Dr. Buchanan finishes his post by noting that a primary driver of the Creationist movement to buck Evolutionary Theory is rooted in a deep desire to obliterate materialism. He has this to say on the impossible nature of that goal:

"" Every human alive today was conceived and grown by strictly materialistic processes. We can watch sperms fertilize eggs and see the egg cells divide; we can in large measure track the biochemical processes behind all this. The growth of neuronal networks in the fetal brain unfolds without supernatural invention. Every mental event corresponds to some array of physical events in the brain, which in turn are subject to the usual laws of physics. These are the key facts that anti-materialists have to deal with.

Whether or not scientists are able to explain every twist and turn of evolution does not touch these currently-observed facts. Thus, ID’s campaign of sowing doubt about evolution cannot possibly accomplish its avowed goal of unseating materialistic philosophies.""

I think there is something to this. The version of God Dr. Buchanan sees in Creationism is too small. He is bound by the human interpretation of a book He is supposed to have written. He notes that the loss of faith experienced by enormously growing numbers of young adults today is due to the ride-or-die attitude some Creationists preach to them: that they must accept the bible entirely literally and reject any aspect of nature that disagrees, or they aren't truly Christian. 

Add to this the glaring lack of even a basic understanding of Evolutionary Theory that is so prevalent on popular YEC websites and it becomes clear that one of the major reasons why people don't accept evolutionary theory is simply because they aren't taught *what it is and what we expect.* After all, it's quite easy to disprove the other side when you make their arguments for them.

Hopefully this post has helped illuminate the actual expectations conventional science has of transitional forms.

TL;DR: Transitional fossils are characterized by a vast variety of factors which are often overlooked or unknown to Creationists entirely. These factors must be understood to properly understand why transitional fossils absolutely concur with Evolutionary Theory, and when they are ignored the result is a conversation based in non-conventional science that is not viable in any practical aspect of the field.",26,7,1558054005,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bpkl6p/realistic_expectations_for_transitional_fossils_a/
DebateEvolution,bpa5rz,Jonathandavid77,Accepts evolution,t2_15ml7b4i,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationism as a paradigm in crisis,"If we look at creationism as an a priori potentially valid scientific paradigm, we can study it from the context of Thomas Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*. One quote from that book that seems particularly relevant is this, from chapter VIII, *The Response to Crisis*:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When...an anomaly comes to seem more than just another puzzle of normal science, the transition to crisis and to extraordinary science has begun. The anomaly itself now comes to be more generally recognized as such by the profession. More and more attention is devoted to it by more and more of the field's most eminent men \[sic\]. If it still continues to resist, as it usually does not, many of them may come to view its resolution as *the* subject matter of their discipline. For them the field will no longer look quite the same as it had earlier. Part of its different appearance results simply from the new fixation point of scientific scrutiny. An even more important source of change is the divergence of the numerous partial solutions that concerted attention to the problem has made available. The early attacks upon the resistant. problem will have followed the paradigm rules quite closely. But with continuing resistance, more and more of the attacks upon it will have involved some minor or not so minor articulation of the paradigm, not two of them quite alike, each partially successful, but none sufficiently so to be accepted as paradigm by the group. Through this proliferation of divergent articulations (more and more frequently they will come to be described as *ad hoc* adjustments), the rules of normal science become increasingly blurred. Though there still is a paradigm, few practitioners prove to be entirely agreed about what it is. Even formerly standard solutions of solved problems are called in question.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say you're a creationist, and you have a piece of research that you want to present at a big event where lots of other creationists (and ID proponents, if you distinguish them) are present. You're walking around and looking at an exhibit of posters, not unlike you'd see at a typical scientific meeting.

The ""proliferation of theories"" you'd see would be remarkable. You might see something about the Cambrian explosion, hydroplates, biblical interpretation, mutation rates, sedimentology of the Grand Canyon, information theory, and so on. But not only would the subjects diverge widely, they'd also contradict each other: the Cambrian explosion material would rely on traditional geological dating techniques, while another guy's poster about ""polonium haloes"" would call all dating into question. Each contributor might have a different idea of how to recognize a ""created kind"". When looking at a poster, you'd have to check what the author's theoretical background is. Even ""YEC"" is not enough: apparently, creationist can't agree about using the Septuagint or Masoretic Text versions of the bible. In conversations with other creationists, you'd often come to the conclusion that the person you're talking to is operating on a totally different level, and doesn't share some of your most basic ideas, even though you're both creationists and supposedly have something in common. That in itself is not so bad, but the problem would be that your paradigm offers no solutions for working out the differences. Each solution offered would just divide the adherents of the paradigm more, it would be another ""ad hoc"" addition.

This situation is very much what Kuhn describes above. Creationists respond to new data like a scientists in a true scientific field would do when confronted by a crisis. They can't agree on a solution and they can't unify their theories into a paradigm.

This implies that there should be one or more anomalies that plague creationism. The problem here is not that these anomalies can't be solved - creationists offer solutions to any problem, although quite a few of these solutions involve just sticking a finger in each ear - but rather that these solutions don't work as ""puzzle solutions"" in terms of the original paradigm.

Since creationism as we know it now was conceived long after Darwin came up with a scientifically workable theory of evolution (see Michael Ruse, *The Evolution-Creation Struggle*) the biggest anomaly has from the start been evolution itself. So one could justifiably say that creationism knew crisis from the start. But radiometric dating, historical geology, and genetics have put innumerable anomalies in front of creationists, a lot which have divided it even more. The time that was ""devoted by eminent men"" was spent on tackling anomalies right from the start, and this work piled up faster than they could handle. There never was any normal puzzle-solving to begin with.

And therefore, regardless of whether it is true or false, creationism has never been able to grow out of being a pseudoscience.",20,24,1557996827,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bpa5rz/creationism_as_a_paradigm_in_crisis/

Cetaceans roam our oceans today as both immense predators and gentle giants. From the tiny Vaquita to the enormous Blue Whale (the largest animal currently known to inhabit our planet in all it's history) these marine mammals occupy some of the niches left open by the extinct sea-going reptiles of old. They began this journey some 50-55 million year ago as a terrestrial hoofed mammal no larger than a housecat. 

What drove this return to the sea? What evidence do we have to support it? How could it occur so quickly? 

This post aims to document the evolutionary transitions of cetaceans from their humble terrestrial beginnings to the majesty of the great organisms roaming our seas today, as well as examine the genetic and embryologic evidence for this journey. Finally, we will examine some of the qualms YEC sites have with the entire idea.

Let's get started!

**Part 1: Feet and Fins**

As usual with these posts, we must identify what separates our ""starting"" species or genus from our ""ending"" species or genus. It is important to keep in mind that our classifications of organisms is an attempt to categorize a gradient of ever-changing forms; it's somewhat arbitrary. That said, these classifications serve to help us observe evolutionary trends.

Although first we must define some of the aspects of our modern cetacean's classification. 

Modern cetaceans are apart of the order *Artiodactyla*, or, the even-toed ungulates. These are hoofed animals who bear weight on an even number of toes. But they have other defining characteristics, such as their scapula shape and unique joints (trochlear hinges) built for maintaining stability at high speeds.

The latter, is why we classify cetaceans in artiodactyla: They have hind limbs that are stunted in development, but display *artiodactyl characteristics*: the [**trochlear hinges (astragalus)**](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDGwhales/Whales.htm)

These traits are absolutely unique to artiodactyls, and all modern animals classified as such possess them: including the cetaceans. 

Which leads us to out most basal form: [Indohyus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indohyus)

Indohyus lived some 48-55 million years ago, and has all the traits one would desire in an artiodactyl: four limbs under the body, a rostral pair of nostrils, **hooves with trochlear hinges**, mobile scapula, a short skull, conical tail, bulky shape and not much else. Except... it does have a unique trait: the **involucrum.** This is a bony middle ear structure which is today, *UNIQUE to cetaceans and no other animal.* Additionally, Indohyus has bone density similar to Hippos, the most genetically close relative to cetaceans in living organisms.

This is why we start with Indohyus:

**Indohyus Traits**

* Four limbs below body
* nasal opening at end of snout
*  bulky non-streamlined shape with weight-bearing pelvis
*  short skull
*  terrestrial
* Heterodont Teeth
* Conical tail
* Involucrum 

**Modern Cetacean Traits**

* Two distinguished fins no hindlimbs (save the non-weight-bearing pelvis and reduced femur)
*  blowhole (dorsocranial nasal opening)
* streamlined shape
*  elongated skull
*  aquatic
* Monodont teeth
*  tail flukes
* Involucrum

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: The Whales of this Tale**

The evolutionary change takes place over 13-15 million years. This seems like a short amount of time, but this will be addressed later. First lets take a look at the organisms in this lineage. 

As usual, it is important to remember the bushy nature of life, taphonomy and fossilization. Even though we have what appears to be a concise and stepwise transition of forms, species can persist past their progeny's emergence and forms are *likely* not truly direct, but rather depict a gradient of traits appearing and overall evolutionary trends. 

If this is not properly understood or outright rejected there is not much point in further discussion.

This is seen in practice when we meet the ""next"" on the line, whose fossil exists before and alongside Indohyus:

[**Pakicetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakicetus)**: 52-48 MYA:** More wolf-like, Pakicetus has a narrower snout, and has lost the characteristic dental trait of mammals: specialization of the teeth (heterodontia), and a deducible dental formula. Instead, it has the conical teeth most carnivorous cetaceans have (monodontia). 

Now this animal has webbed feet rather than hooves. How do we know it's related to indohyus? It has the **ARTIODACTYL KNEE AND ANKLE, complete with troclear hinges**. This is stunning, because no carnivorous animal today HAS artiodactyl knees/ankle... but all cetaceans have the remnants of them. Pakicetus ALSO has the **involucrum.** It's bone chemistry suggests a freshwater lifestyle with excursions into, but not permanent living in, the water.

Currently it is suggested that Pakicetus and Indohyus shared a common ancestor with an involucrum, and not the the latter begat the former. This is especially due to the existence of the [Mesonychids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonychid): hoofed carnivores who also lived in the Eocene. These organisms are in a similar position as Pakicetus: hoofed animals with toes (hoofs becoming a sort of nail analogue). It has been proposed that the Mesonychids gave rise to the pakicetids, [but molecular evidence has rejected this hypothesis.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11783081_Skeletons_of_terrestrial_cetaceans_and_the_relationship_of_whales_to_artiodactyls)

The reason Indohyus is included however is due to it's possession of the involucrum which is unique to cetaceans and no current terrestrial life making it a relative, if perhaps a more distant offshoot.

[**Ambulocetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulocetus)**: 47.8-41.3 MYA** arrives on the scene next, Mid-Eocene, and resembles a large mammalian crocodile. Bone analysis shows a delta-lifestyle with some time in saline and some in freshwater. It also has the **artiodactyl joints (TH)** and the involucrum, but unlike pakicetus, ambulocetus is beginning to grow sluggish on land. It's hindlimb structure is just not quite as conducive to terrestrial locomotion.

In comparison to the pakicetids, these guys have more robust feet and a more flexible spine. They also have transitioning orbits (positioned dorsally but not yet frontated) precisely like current amphibious mammals such as hippos. This is ideal for peering out of the water while submerged! 

[**Rodhocetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodhocetus) **48.6-40 MYA** AGAIN have the **involucrum** and the **artiodactyl joints**. This guy has a new cetacean-only trait in the making: **four of it's sacral vertebra are partially fused.** In cetaceans today, ALL the sacral vert. are fused. This animal has a bone density of saltwater exclusivity, and has nostrils beginning to move up dorsally. This is not surprising, as we now have the pressure to breathe without the effort a rostral nostril would require.

This organism likely lived alongside Ambulocetus for a while, especially since they occupied different niches. Species exist in both the rodhocetid and ambulocetid genera that actively display the variety even within these larger categorizations. 

[**Dorudon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorudon)**: 40-33.9 MYA.** Still, **involucrum** and **artiodactyl joints**. Now the sacrum is fully fused as well, and the nostrils are MORE dorsal than before. Eyes have moved frontally now, and some paleontologists have suggested the existence of tail flukes. Hind limbs are still ""useful"" in and of themselves, but gone are the webbed feet: it has flippers. Wholly marine, dorudon has all the traits of a modern cetacean save the fully dorsal blowhole, fully developed melon organ, fully interal hind limbs and large brain.

[**Basilosaurus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilosaurus) **40-35 MYA** is enormous and nearly a full cetacean. It has all of Dorudon's traits (including that involucrum and the artiodactyl knee/ankle) as well as it's general streamlined shape. The blowhole is even more dorsal in comparison though, and the hind flippers are all but internal. The braincase is still somewhat small from the social cetaceans of today though. But for intents and purposes, this is a near-cetacean.

Additionally are the [**Remingtoncetids**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remingtonocetidae) **(47-43 MYA)** who are considered relatives of modern cetaceans, but as offshoots or ""cousins"". These strange beasts resembled mammalian gharial with narrow muzzles stacked with thin teeth. They have been found with the protocetids (rodhocetids) as well as with ancient crocodiles, sirenians and catfish. [Never](https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/459.pdf) with indohyus, pakicetus or ambulocetus who predate this genera in some cases and vary in habitat in others. They also posses the involucrum and artiodactyl joints. 

Thus in the lineage for cetaceans a rough separation can be made: 

**Basal hoofed Goup**

Indohyus and perhaps Indohyus and Pakicetus's CA

**Most Basal Cetaceans**

Pakicetids and Ambulocetids

**Protocetids and Remingtoncetids**

Rhodocetus and the Remintongtoncetids

**Basal Obligate Marine Whales**

Dorudon and Basilosaurus 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: The Timeline (and molecular data)**

[Timetree.org](https://Timetree.org) allows one to pull general timelines from compiled molecular data ([How they do it](http://www.hedgeslab.org/pubs/260.pdf)). This source backs up the timeline for cetacean proliferation over the course of 13-15 million years. This kind of change seems quite large over that period of time, but empirically it is supported by mutation rates and transitional fossils.

The same site, among many others, support our own evolution from the chimpanzee-like S. tchadensis in a mere 7-9 million years. 

What these two events (and many others of ""fast"" evolution) have in common is that they are seemingly spurred by environmental change. In our own lineage this resulted from the East African Rift creating a sparse savanna not idea for arboreal quadrupeds. And in the cetaceans we see the opening of the niches left by the marine reptiles. 

This is seen in modern times as well with the [Pod Mrcaru Lizards](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/04/lizard-evolution-island-darwin/).

Essentially, individuals from a parent population on one Italian island were relocated to a new island (5 pairs, so 5 males and 5 females) back in 1971. Researchers then checked in on them 50 years later, and found that the lizards had undergone rapid evolutionary change in response to a new food source.

The lizards on the parent island were insectivorous, but the new population had switched to herbivorous habits. The new lizards had adaptions for herbivory seen in only 1% of all lizards: cecal valves, hindgut bacteria for digesting foliage and a new skull shape built for managing leaf eating. All in just 50 years!

Selection becomes highly directional when there is enough environmental pressure is the long and short of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4: It's all Genes to me**

If evolutionary theory in this case is valid, than the genes will tell us. Since evolution works by tweaking precursor structures (even at the molecular level), we should find remnants of cetacean's terrestrial past in their genome. The first place to look would be for the formation of hindlimbs in embryological development, but we will go over that in embryology. 

Shubin goes over this very topic in his book ""Your Inner Fish"". He notes that all mammals have some 3% of their total genome dedicated to odor detection, including cetaceans. But in these animals, who have over one thousand genes dedicated to smelling and picking up scents in the air (just like all mammals), *every single gene is non-functional.* 

As a result, they also lack a proper gustatory sense (taste), and [some believe](https://zoologicalletters.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40851-014-0002-z) this contributes to the proportionally high number of cetaceans ingesting toxic debris. 

[Bone mass](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/10/3/967/4935247) has also been identified genetically, and found to have been positively selected for: 

"" Comparative genomic analyses of cetaceans and their terrestrial relatives provided several novel insights into the distinct evolutionary scenarios of adaptation to a fully aquatic lifestyle. Genes associated with oxidation–reduction and immune process were found to be accompanied by pseudogene copies. Genes under positive selection in the cetaceans were related to reproduction, keratin protein, learning, and energy turnover. This was interesting given their special lifestyle compared with other mammals. Our study also documented the bone microstructure across mammals and marine mammals, and for the first time, revealed the benefit of using a phylogenetic comparative approach to study the evolution of bone compactness. Our findings offer valuable information on genes critical for adaptation to aquatic life of mammals in diverse environments. ""

Just these two examples pose some large questions to the proposal of intelligent design and progressive creationism.

**Part 5: Embryology** 

Equally as fascinating as the genes is the development. Just as we as humans bear some of the traces of our fore-bearers in-utero, so do cetaceans. 

Modern cetaceans undergo a stage in their embryological development where they begin to develop hindlimbs, just as they do their forelimbs. This is what is considered business as usual. But the development of the hindlimbs terminates soon after the buds form, and they waste away until only the pelvis and some femoral remnants are left (as they are first to form). 

You can find these stages pictured [here](https://evolutionforskeptics.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny-fetal-whales-have-hindlimb-buds/) by actual cetacean embryos.

What has appeared to have happened is that a mutation halts the development at a predetermined point each time a pup develops. Studies have pinpointed what happens [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/22/8414) : ""... cetacean embryos do initiate hind-limb bud development. In dolphins, the bud arrests and degenerates around the fifth gestational week. Initial limb outgrowth in amniotes is maintained by two signaling centers, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). Our data indicate that the cetacean hind-limb bud forms an AER and that this structure expresses Fgf8 initially, but that neither the AER nor Fgf8 expression is maintained.""

Some Creationists have proposed the existence of the pelvis is for copulatory purposes in the male cetaceans, and it may well be, but this is not an explanation for the hindlimbs themselves, nor the convoluted process that forms both.

**Part 6: YEC perspective**

As a forward here, much of these arguments boil down to ""You have Pakicetus and Ambulocetus but wheres the transition between those two!"" and ""Not enough Time"".

ICR starts us off with: ""Scientific Roadblocks to Whale Evolution""

*"" A number of land animals have been proposed as the whale's ancestor, including Darwin's bear, grazing ungulates, wolf-like carnivores (Mesonyx), and the hippopotamus. In each case the morphological differences are significant. If whales (cetaceans) did evolve from land mammals, they did so at an unbelievable rate, accruing an amazing number of ""beneficial"" mutations and adaptations.""*

This is appealing to the issue of time, and also never actually mentions the proposed first cetacean: Pakicetus. It goes so far as to suggest Ambulocetus the following paragraph:

*""The skeletal features would need to change radically, as well as the physiology (the collective functions of an organism). For example, the supposed early ""whale,"" Ambulocetus, drank fresh water probably throughout its life ""50 million years ago,"" and Indocetus was a saltwater drinker ""48 million years ago."" This means that in perhaps three million years there had to be an extreme change in the physiology of these creatures.""*

This article was written in 1998 and pakicetus was found in 1981 so I'm not sure why it is never mentioned. Additionally this salinity ""problem"" ignores the analysis of ambulocetus's bones, which show a clear brackish lifestyle in between pakicetus's more freshwater and rodhocetus's more marine. 

It goes on to complain about maintaining heat in the cold recesses of deepwater, apparently ignorant of both blubber and polar animals who possess it in favor of creating an issue with homeostasis that is not problematic. 

AiG is also out and about with ""Fossil Evidence of Whale Evolution""

This involves Terry sending a message to talkorigins which is both brave and malinformed. This article doesn't simply pose nonpromblematic issues, but presents a very flagrant misunderstanding of what it is trying to refute. Some highlights:

*"" Certainly there has been diversification within the whale kinds (see what I mean about “kind” in point 2 below). But how do you know that what you have been told about certain fossils is really evidence of the evolution of whales from some land animal? How do you know that the fossils can be arranged in a nice neat record of successively younger rocks? You are not a paleontologist and didn’t dig up the fossils. Given the statement by Raup about horse fossils (*[*in the first part of this article*](https://answersingenesis.org/charles-darwin/darwinism/was-darwin-right/)*), I certainly will not trust evolutionist claims without careful examination. ""*

The fossils are arranged according to the age of the rock they are found in (via radiometric dating, a [very accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) method of telling the age of igneous rock). Because these fossils can be separated by general age, the trend of the emergence of traits can be observed, creating a succinct means of examining change over time.

I do appreciate the ""You weren't there"" aspect of ""historical science"" being applied to literally digging up a fossil, followed by a warning not to trust ""evolutionists"". Frequently AiG likes to bring up paleontologic hoaxes, unaware they are quite rare in comparison to hoaxes of artifacts of historical antiquity and art. 

*""I have no idea what you mean by saying, “‘Arrival of the fittest’ is of course a biological question and has little to do with evolution.” Isn’t evolution a hypothesis about the origin of biological life? Do you mean that the origin of the first living cell is a question that has little to do with evolution? If so, I disagree. It has everything to do with it. If evolutionists can’t explain how the first living, reproducing cell came into existence by time, chance, and the laws of nature working on non-living matter, then the theory of evolution is dead. Natural selection and mutations can only work on living, reproducing organisms.""*

Dreadful. This false equivalency is why so many secular (and religious but conventional) scientists are quick to be wary of Creationists. Abiogenesis is not evolution, and it simply doesn't matter how much Terry misunderstands this or blatantly disagrees because it is a hard and fast definitions game.

*"" Actually, time is not the hero of the plot, but the villain. Time doesn’t create anything. With the help of the Second Law of Thermodynamics it destroys things. The more time we have, the more mutations destroy genetic information, as Spetner’s and Sanford’s books above persuasively show.""*

A misunderstanding of what constitutes ""new"" genetic information (for which AiG lacks a definition for *anyways*) in conventional science, and another misuse of the 2nd Law. The Earth is not a closed system Terry!

*""Evolution and millions of years hopelessly fail to explain our world. They don’t explain the origin and diversification of genetic information, the origin of incredible design in living things, and the origin of human language, which is vastly different and superior to any animal communication. They don’t explain the fossil record or the thousands of feet of sedimentary rock layers (some of which extend for tens of thousands of square miles). They don’t explain the orderly design of the solar system. And while evolutionists assume the validity of the laws of nature, their evolutionary ideas cannot explain why those laws are valid. And the evolutionary view provides no basis for purpose and meaning in life or any absolute morality.""*

I think this is something of a ""cart before the horse"" scenario given he's already fighting a version of evolutionary theory that does not exist. But I would love to see Terry tackle the issues geology, cosmology and paleontology present to his worldview once he's gotten a grasp on what he's actually against.

**Conclusion/ TL;DR**

Through 13-15 million years of geologic time the transition of terrestrial hoofed mammals to the cetaceans of today is well documented in transitional fossils. The persistence of identifying morphologic traits (involucrum and artiodactyl joints) supports this notion along with current molecular data, genome maps and embryology.

So let's suppose these aquatic extraterrestials were real fossils without traces of phenotypes, would you argue that they evolved together by arguing merely on their bone structures?

The aforementioned course is an AP course (Advanced Placement, for those outside North America), and as such I have a deeper understanding than your typical Bio student, which I hope to utilise to make my point here. Also, **this post presumes that the reader has a preexisting knowledge of biology and knows the definition of many words specific to biology, but if any reader does not, I would be happy to provide a definition/brief synopsis of a process.**

I have studied life in order of gradually increasing complexity, begging at the molecules essential to life and progressing up to the organisation of ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole. All of it fundamentally supports the idea of evolution, but one thing I found especially interesting was endosymbiont theory.  

Endosymbiont theory states that mitochondria and chloroplasts and other plastids came about as a result of a larger cell engulfing a smaller one--capable of aerobic cellular respiration--that managed to avoid digestion and proved as an asset to the larger cell. [Here is a graphic that explains it quite well.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Serial_endosymbiosis.svg) 

The proof for this theory abounds: 

1. New mitochondria and plastids form through binary fission in a manner very similar to prokaryotes. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Three_cell_growth_types.svg) is a graphic showing the difference between binary fission and mitosis.
2. If you remove the mitochondria and/or plastids from a cell, the cell is unable to replace them, strongly suggesting that they do not originate from the cell itself. 
3. Mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes are more similar to the ribosomes (the organelles that make protein using mRNA transcripts) of bacteria than the ribosomes of the cells that contain them \[[source](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050209)\]
4. Some mitochondria and plastids contain circular DNA that closely resembles bacterial DNA in structure \[[source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1271)\] *(this source also shows why organelle genomes are much smaller than what their historical, free-living counterparts would have been, due to lateral DNA transfer of DNA from the organelle into the genome of the ""host"" cell)*, and that DNA bears many resemblances to Rickettsial bacteria (in the case of mitochondria) \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9823893)\] and cyanobacteria (in the case of chloroplasts) \[[source](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/5/1/31/727700)\]

And that proof of endosymbiont theory in turn supports an evolutionary process, not a creationist one:

1. Why would this occur in any other circumstance? The cell continuously fabricates more membrane for the formation of vesicles, so why does it not just fabricate its own facilities to fulfil the absolutely necessary process of cellular respiration?
2. Considering that mitochondria are absolutely essential to the survival of all aerobic cells, this would be an extreme error on the part of any ""creator."" Why design something unable to replace such essential missing parts?
3. Again, how and why would this even occur in a creationist reality; would it not be much more practical to have all the machinery for essential cellular processes originate and be able to be reproduced by the cell itself?
4. What would be the reason for the genetic similarities between cellular organelles and free-living bacteria if there was no such thing as evolution?

Again, if you do not understand the many biology-specific words used in this post (whatever spellchecking service the Reddit editor uses certainly didn't, judging by the presence of many squiggly red lines under almost all of the bio-specific words), feel free to ask for a definition or explanation, or turn to the wider internet and learn from there.",14,6,1556855647,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bk43zo/endosymbiont_theory_among_many_other_things/

An Analysis on the Tetrapod Tracks of Poland

(Or Why Date Changes for Emergence are Not Problematic)

I would like to thank Jonathandavid77 for their enormous help with this post, both in concept in in backing their claims with sources!

Recently I posted about tetrapod evolution both on debateevolution and on creationevolution, the latter of which generated some discussion of the legitimacy of my claims. There were some genuinely good queries and challenges, particularly from eagles107, who brought up a facet of the research regarding tetrapods I was not aware of: A series of tetrapod-like tracks was discovered in Poland back in 2010, dated some 18 million years older than the first tetrapod body fossil (Acanthostega, 365 MYA).

The implications of this are interesting depending on your perspective, point being this was brought up as an example of opposition to Evolution (as a concept).

In this post, I aim to explore the nature of these trackways (both the factual and the “to-be-determined”), as well as the impact that they would/will make if they are truly tetrapodomorph in nature. In addition, we will address the frequent and growing talking point of paleontologic date-change among Creationists, and how this is typically interpreted among conventional scientists.

I invite Eagles107 to give their opinion if they’d like, and MRH2 as well (who had some questions I aim to explore a bit). Additionally, I would like to thank stcodova for pinning the discussion on his sub and maintaining cordiality despite disagreement.

**The Players (a quick refresher)**

Tetrapods, “Fishy Tetrapodomorphs” (Elpistostegalians) and Sarcopterygians

The Sarcoperygians, or lobe-finned fish, persist today, but the lineage beget by Eusthenopteron is potentially that which eventually led to the tetrapods. These organisms have primarily “fish” traits but possess certain tetrapod characteristics (such as skull roofing or labrynthodont teeth).

The “Fishy Tetrapodomorphs” are a colloquial name for the Epistostegalians (mosaics). These organisms have both lobe-finned fish traits and tetrapod traits, and can be difficult to categorize. Examples include Panderichthys and Tiktaalik.

Tetrapoda is a superclass including all mammals, reptiles (birds as well) and amphibians. This group is considered by mainstream science to have emerged sometime in the Devonian period from a line of sarcopterygians and then elpistostegalians. Examples include Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Ventastega Tulerpeton and Proterogyrinus.

A more in depth look can be found at the original post:

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bfz2v5/transitional_species_handbook_tetrapods_mammals/)

**The Tracks: What We Know from the Original Paper**

The original paper breaking the news of these tracks was by the authors and titled “Tetrapod Trackways from the early Middle Devonian Period of Poland” and is by Niedzwiedzki’s team.

The paper begins with what we have already covered: tetrapods evolved from elpithostegalians, who evolved from sarcopterygians living around 385 MYA. The paper notes: this is when the eusthenopteron body fossils we have are *dated to*. This is not when the species is thought to have *emerged.* It goes on to assert that the found tetrapod trackways indicate there is a misconception of not only when tetrapods likely emerged, but the environment in which they did so.

**Tracks have been confirmed to have been made** ***underwater***\*\*, due to both the substrate\*\* **composition and cohesiveness of the sediment in relation to the tracks.**

The paper covered two trackways then: **PGI.16 and PGI.15**

PGI.16 indicates an organism with 7 or 8 digits on the hind limbs, with no digit impressions for the forelimbs. Spacing and absence of body drag are thought to indicate a tetrapod trackway (think how an amphibian “walks” along the bottom of a water body). Angles of the prints indicate morphology dissimilar to the elpistostegalians (removing known species panderichthys and tiktaalik as potential culprits).

PGI.15 indicates an organism much more like panderichthys or tiktaalik, with few strides that suggest “pulling along” with just the front legs. Tracks are smaller and ladder-like, and body drag is not confirmed or denied.

The paper goes on to note how many isolated prints were also found, and the entire assemblage was “In many ways similar to previously described Devonian tetrapod tracks.” It is important to note no prints indicated reptilian presence (no claw marks).

“The best preserved Zachelmie prints are quite similar to the pes morphology of Acanthostega and, in particular, Ichthyostega (Fig. 4b, c).” This is followed by the observation these tracks were likely made by large stem-group tetrapods in fully marine, intertidal environments and lagoons alike.

It concludes then with a statement that will become important later:

“Until now, the replacement of elpithistegids by tetrapods in the in the body-fossil record during the mid-late Frasnian has appeared to reflect an evolutionary event, with the elpistostegids as a short-lived “transitional grade” between fish and tetrapods monotypes (Fig. 5a). In fact, tetrapods and elpithostegids coexisted for 10 million years (Fig. 5b). This implies the elpithostegid morphology was not a brief transitional stage, but a stable adaptive position in its own right. It is reminiscent of the lengthy coexistence of non-volant but feathered and ‘winged’ theropod dinosaurs with the volant stem-group birds during the Mezozoic.”

[The Paper (Paywall)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08623)

**The Tracks: What New Research Says**

As always with finds that have the potential to change scientific status quo, these tracks have been heavily contested through the years.

[Lungfish](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037403/) have been suggested

And [Neil Shubin](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/spot-the-tiktaalik/), tiktaalik’s discoverer, has suggested it could be the likes of “walking fish” (frogfish, mudskippers etc)

But in addition to that, much research has been done to confirm the paper’s findings. Some successful and some inconclusive.

In 2018, researchers did work with the geology of the location, and suggested that while the tracks were made underwater, it is likely a lagoon or brackish environment akin to an [ephemeral lake.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322571065_Non-marine_palaeoenvironment_associated_to_the_earliest_tetrapod_tracks)

But an earlier paper in 2011 suggests a more marine environment. This is accompanied by the use of modern molecular data in order to determine the divergence of the earliest tetrapods. Interestingly enough, their conclusion matched that of the [Poland Trackways](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022136):

“The change in environmental conditions played a major role in their evolution. According to our analysis this evolution occurred at about 397–416 MYA during the Early Devonian unlike previously thought. This idea is supported by various environmental factors such as sea levels and oxygen rate, and biotic factors such as biodiversity of arthropods and coral reefs. The molecular data also strongly supports lungfish as tetrapod's closest living relative.”

And another in 2013 piggybacks on the divergence time with [mutation rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653398?dopt=Abstract):

So that leaves some questions doesn’t it?

**The Tracks: What are we certain of?**

What we know is that we have a set of tracks and trackways in Poland that certainly appear to be tetrapodean in nature, albeit “early” in form. Both these claims are backed by the fact that some prints had digits, at least 7 and potentially 8. This matches the earliest tetrapods we have: Acanthostega and Ichthyostega.

But we can’t be certain of the species. All we know is that it is potentially one of these two, or a tetrapod very similar in morphology. This claim is backed by the required skeletal and muscular structure required to make these tracks.

We know the tracks were made underwater, thanks to the substrate composition and cohesion. But we can’t be sure if it was marine coast/inlet or a brackish lagoon at this point.

We can be certain of the dates as well, and that they place this organism well before our first body fossil of Eusthenopteron.

So what does this mean?

**The Nature of Emergence: What the Tracks Mean**

The discoverers of the tracks can be quoted in their original paper: “This implies the elpistostegid morphology was not a brief transitional stage, but a stable adaptive position in its own right. It is reminiscent of the lengthy coexistence of non-volant but feathered and ‘winged’ theropod dinosaurs with the volant stem-group birds during the Mezozoic.”

Creationists point to the coexistence of the likely-tetrapod and the likely-elpistostegid and remark that it is indicative of creation rather than evolution.

But the founders of the tracks say very much the opposite: **The coexistence is indicative of evolution working as it should;** ***forms that work stick around.***

Jonathandavid77 made an excellent point themselves in their comment on the post at creationevolution: “The ages of the fossils does not give us the date when they speciated. All we know is that the species existed when the creature died. The dates on these fossils are consistent with a late Devonian age for the evolution of tetrapods. In fact, they line up well.

It should also be remembered that fish like Eusthenopteron and similar forms didn't suddenly go extinct when tetrapods appeared. There were still sarcopterygians, just like are descended from apes, but apes are still around.”

This point is compounded on when we consider the lineage the authors point out: that of birds. Which leads me to my next point:

**Contemporary Fossils are Not Problematic**

This argument is but a dressed up version of ""If humans came from monkeys why are there still monkeys?""

The habitats conducive to tiktaalik are the same which would be conducive to acanthostega or panderichtys. Yet somehow it seems absurd to YEC’s to consider the idea that a species that was successful enough to proliferate and evolve didn’t just die off after leaving progeny behind. In fact it is important to note that **this very idea of stepwise proliferation and extinction runs contra to evolutionary theory’s principle of Natural Selection**.

In addition to this, evolutionary theory in application to transitional fossils has a very important caveat that so many seem to miss: **Transitional fossils serve to measure overall trends in traits and trait ratios.**

This means it doesn’t matter one bit to evolutionary theory if an organism with a few more derived traits lives before what is traditionally considered transitional, and birds are a great example!

Animals very similar to what we could consider modern birds lived in the late cretaceous **alongside** feathered theropods. That does not change the fact that the overall emergence of traits and ratio of traits in a given lineage matches **evolutionary theory perfectly.**

The semilunate carpal arrives in a tiny, scaly, “classic” theropod named Compsognathus, and is never lost throughout the following lineage.

[My post on birds](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdcgoz/transitional_species_handbook_birds_are_the/) goes more in depth on which traits tend to stick around in that bushy linegae.

**What about Time?**

Jonathandavid77 made an excellent response to MRH2 when the question of change in a “short” amount of time was asked. How long does it take realistically for a eusthenopteron to yield a lineage that looked like panderichthys?

Jonathandavid77 noted that the change is not large first and foremost, and cited Gaining Ground: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods by Jennifer Clack covering the skeletal changes required. They also noted that 5 million years is quite a bit of time when compared to the evolution required in 4000 after Noah’s Flood, or 6000 from the YEC timescale.

They source the mutation rate as well: “There is good evidence that, given reasonable mutation rates, the divergence between tetrapods and other sarcopterygians happened in the Devonian period: [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653398?dopt=Abstract)”

Finally, we can look to the Pod Mrcaru lizards as well to see quick change over time. individuals from a parent population on one Italian island were relocated to a new island (5 pairs, so 5 males and 5 females) back in 1971. Researchers then checked in on them 50 years later, and found that the lizards had undergone rapid evolutionary change in response to a new food source.

The lizards on the parent island were insectivorous, but the new population had switched to herbivorous habits. The new lizards had adaptions for herbivory seen in only 1% of all lizards: cecal valves, hindgut bacteria for digesting foliage and a new skull shape built for managing leaf eating! All in just 50 years!

**Not All Science is Equal (Evidently)**

Finally, we come to the most common criticism I have seen (anecdotally) in regard to paleontology. Creationists are keen to point out when the dates change for a species’ emergence or the timescale for a given evolutionary change.

Mind you, the change is (to my knowledge) never the result of incorrect radiometric dating, but rather from finding a new specimen in a new area of rock.

It should be noted as well: *things almost exclusively get older when dates change.* Pollen is found earlier, or tracks mark a more ancient divergence. And these number remain in the hundreds of millions.

But the crux of the issue isn’t that these dates change; of course they change. It is rare to get something right the first time when the answer rests on discovery.

The problem is the attitude behind this one particular branch of study that includes many fields: those which pertain to life origins and evolution.

You will rarely find a Creationist complain when Physics alters itself (classic example being the abandonment of Newtonian Physics for Stellar bodies in favor of Relativity) but if the date is changed by a mere 10 million years (in a 4.8 billion year scale) the entire science must be tossed out with the bathwater.

This is despite Evolutionary Theory’s ability to make predictions within it’s own field. Tiktaalik’s finding is often used but I am going to make a different argument.

Before these trackways, the timescale was based off of found body-fossil dates. This is reasonable, and no cause for doubt existed. But with the discovery of the tracks, there suddenly was this large question mark for the tetrapod lineage. Why were tracks appearing earlier? This gave us reason to check our previous notions with new technology and methods.

And when this was done via [molecular data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022136) it was found that the tracks were correct, and divergence given by the molecular data matched them almost to a tee. **This would not have been done if it weren’t for the tracks, but here we have two independent methods corroborated the new date for divergence.** This is how discovery in science works: if data is presented that drastically challenges your status quo, you must reevaluate.

And this is something I have yet to see major YEC organizations do.

**Conclusions/TL;DR**

The Poland Tetrapod Tracks give near-absolute reason to reevaluate when these organisms emerged, and are corroborated by independent research, mutation rates, and molecular data. Contrary to Creationist claims, paleontologists (both the discoverers and others) see this as an example of successful forms persisting past evolutionary divergence. Additionally, the tracks embody morphologic trends seen in known species of the fossil record, further confirming the previously held notions of evolution of forms in tetrapods. While there is much to learn about these tracks and tetrapod evolution, we can be certain that according to conventional science (including the long-held ideas of Evolutionary Theory) they are abjectly not problematic.",9,14,1556349093,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bhwmlq/an_analysis_on_the_tetrapod_tracks_of_poland/

Tetrapoda is a superclass including all mammals, reptiles (birds as well) and amphibians. This group is considered by mainstream science to have emerged sometime in the Devonian period around 350 to 380 MYA from a line of sarcopterygians, or lobe finned fish. This group includes modern coelacanth and itself is likely an evolutionary lineage descending from the proto-lungfish known as [Dipterus](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/d/dipterus.html). 

How do we know this? Are there any criticisms? 

The following post will examine the various fossil transitions we have from Eusthenopteron to the Tetrapodomorphs (and Temnospondyls), and examine the YEC criticisms of this lineage.

**Part 1: A Fish Called Eusthenopteron** 

As always, the first task with examining transitional species is to identify the primary differing traits between the organisms with traits considered more ""primitive"" and that with traits considered more ""derived"". These terms aren't ideal, and it should be noted that in this post we are primarily using them to denote change in traits through geologic time. 

**Eusthenopteron Traits**

* “Fish” style skull (tall and narrow, sockets to the sides)
* No neck or cervical-style vertebrae
* No distinct hind-limbs
* “Webbed” tailfin
*  No distinct digits
* No true wrist
* External Gills (with gill chamber)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tetrapodomorph Traits**

* “Tetrapod” style skull (flat and wide, sockets angled forward)
*  Neck and cervical vertebrae
*  Distinct hind-limbs
* Reduced tail that usually drags
*  Distinct digits
* True Wrist
* No External gills

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: The Land Before Spine**

The Devonian period was an odd time. It is generally known as the ""Age of Fishes"", but it should be noted that at this same time vast fern-like forests were beginning to stretch across the land, continuing their invasion from the Ordovician millions of years earlier. This is important, as the more the plants dominate, the more available habitat for the arthropods: a future food source for the tetrapods! 

But for the most part this is a warm and humid time; ideal for more invaders from the sea. With the coast as free real estate, the sarcopterygians of the pelagic zone have an opportunity to seize. 

[**Euthentopteron**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/e/eusthenopteron.html)  **(385 MYA)**

Euthenopteron is definitely a fish, but it bears unique characteristics that will come in handy in it's descendants future on land. It is the only organism in the sea during this time to have labrynthodont teeth, a trait found in the first tetrapods, as well as the skull roofing pattern and appendicular bones which appear in the vertebrate land lubbers. Its fin endoskeleton, which appears to be a more advanced version of the Devonian coelacanth’s, bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius (in the fore-fin) and femur, tibia, and fibula (in the pelvic fin). However, this animal is still clearly a fish. It bears gills and a webbed tail fin, lacks a neck, a true wrist and tetrapod vertebrae.

[**Panderichthys**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/p/panderichthys.html) **(380 MYA)**

While again, clearly still a fish (gills, fins, webbed tailfin, no neck or true wrist) we see the beginnings of the wrist and forearm developing skeletally. Compared to Eusthenopteron, the skull shares more in common with tetrapods than fish, both in roofing and in shape (flatter than it is tall). The pelvic girdle continues to develop as well, and the dorsal and anal fins have vanished. The vertebral column is ossified and beginning to look more like the spine of a tetrapod. Nares are moving to a tetrapodomorph position as well. This animal likely did not leave water, but the pectorals are developed enough that it is possible it was capable of squirming from closely located bodies of water. 

[**Tiktaalik**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/t/tiktaalik.html) **(375 MYA)**

Neil Shubins famous transitional! Tiktaalik is a lovely mosaic of traits: Head is flat and wide like the tetrapods.

a wrist that is continuing to advance (bones differentiating), the interior bones of arm/wrist are stronger and padded for “pushing up” and the eyes are on the TOP of the skull. Tiktaalik bears bones for heavy pectoral muscle attachments allowing it to push up and out of the water.A NECK has appeared, along with muscle attachments for moving head side to side and up and down, and accompanied by cervical vertebrae. However, it has fins rather and no digitsand scales (the tetrapods have primarily skin). And perhaps the most telling transitional trait: Tiktaalik has both gills AND lungs. This animal likely could easily migrate from pools of water, although it's life is still primarily spent there. 

[**Ancanthostega**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/acanthostega.html) **(365 MYA)**

This animal was certainly spending some time outside of the water, although it would have been somewhat cumbersome. Digits are fully developed, but wrists still are not, thus, due to the wrist immobility, it likely still spent most time in the water and clung to plants with it’s “hands” Teeth remain labrynthodont and the skull is entirely tetrapod-like. Interestingly enough, there are eight digits on each limb not the five we've expect from tetrapods. But even with these odd hands, four limbs, each with digits, are present meaning this animal could likely move between pools of water. Gills are present still, along with lungs (as with lungfish).

[**Ichthyostega**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/i/ichthyostega.html) **(365-360 MYA)**

Ichthyostega differs from Acanthostega in two primary ways: it's ribs and it's wrists. Ichthyostega's ribs are far more robust, and they overlap, meaning this animal would not have struggled under it's own weight while walking. It also has full mobile wrists, meaning it could traverse land far easier simply due to it's enhanced mobility. Interestingly enough, Ichthyostega has only *seven* digits per hand/foot, a step towards our standard of five.  The various fossils we have indicate it was more adept at terrestriality as a juvenile, returning to a primarily aquatic life as an adult, which would suit it just fine as it's gills are still present.

[**Tulerpeton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulerpeton) **(365-360 MYA)**

The seven toes diminish to six in this animal. It possesses all the land attributes which gave Ichthyostega an edge, and has lost it's gills. However, a new adaption give Tulerpeton an additional trick: it's neck and pectoral girdle aren't connected. This means it can lift it's head up and down rather than just side to side, allowing it to peek above the waters while obscuring the rest of it's body. A considerable hunting advantage. The plants it's fossils were found with indicate a brackish habitat where salinity and water level varied wildly. This paints a picture of a stealthy pool-hopper patrolling the deltas. 

From here, the various forms take off even more, specializing in odd ways for over 30 million years. And down the line we have a *clear* example of a ""typical"" tetrapod in:

[**Proterogyrinu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterogyrinus)**s (330 MYA)**

This enormous tetrapod (6-7 feet long) is likely not the first of the typical tetrapods, but it is a very well preserved example. A monstrous early tetrapod, Proterogyrinus is fully terrestrial, five-toed and squat with a flat, salamander-style head. It has a non-webbed tail dragging behind, true wrists and *five* digits, while being robust and able to move quickly on land 

So with the players in the lineage outlined, lets examine some of the additional facets of tetrapod evolution before diving into the criticisms. 

**Part 3: The Terrestrial Mystery Tour**

So why leave water in the first place? At a light glace, it seems like these animals had it made in the sea. But the water sported many dangers which likely pushed the sarcopterygians into the pegalic zones, coasts and deltas. Heavy set predators such as dunkleosteus lurked in the deep water, along with the continued reign of the sharks. Once in the shallows, it is likely these animals wandered into hybrid territories such as mangrove swamps or shallow deltas. 

Now, already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (similar to modern fish and amphibians, which often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests before migrating outward) these animals occupied two very different niches partially overlapped with one other. 

The land along the water thus became the less crowded, less dangerous option for those juveniles living nearby, and those species who could take advantage of it were rewarded with a directional selection for terrestriality. 

Those who ventured onto land also gained a new food source to take advantage of: the arthropods living there. 

Of course there are some enormous challenges to switching from the sea to the land (or vice versa). We covered already the skeletal changes which needed to occur, as well as the steps to breathing air exclusively (gills, gills AND lungs, lungs) but what about the chemistry of it? The nature of pulling O2 from water is very different from pulling it from the air. 

[The tetrapod evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_tetrapods) article on wikipedia has a nice summary: 

""In order for the lungs to allow gas exchange, the lungs first need to have gas in them. In modern tetrapods, three important breathing mechanisms are conserved from early ancestors, the first being a CO2/H+ detection system. In modern tetrapod breathing, the impulse to take a breath is triggered by a buildup of CO2 in the bloodstream and not a lack of O2. A similar CO2/H+ detection system is found in all [Osteichthyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteichthyes), which implies that the [last common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor) of all Osteichthyes had a need of this sort of detection system.

The second mechanism for a breath is a [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) system in the lungs to facilitate gas exchange. This is also found in all Osteichthyes, even those that are almost entirely aquatic. The highly conserved nature of this system suggests that even aquatic Osteichthyes have some need for a surfactant system, which may seem strange as there is no gas underwater. The third mechanism for a breath is the actual motion of the breath. This mechanism predates the last common ancestor of Osteichthyes, as it can be observed in [*Lampetra camtshatica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey)*,* the [sister clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_group) to Osteichthyes. 

In Lampreys, this mechanism takes the form of a ""cough"", where the lamprey shakes its body to allow water flow across its gills. When CO2 levels in the lamprey's blood climb too high, a signal is sent to a central pattern generator that causes the lamprey to ""cough"" and allow CO2 to leave its body. This linkage between the CO2 detection system and the central pattern generator is extremely similar to the linkage between these two systems in tetrapods, which implies homology.""

We can look into the genetics as well, covered a bit in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b5k9sv/the_evolution_of_the_inner_ear_or_the_zoo_in_you/) on the inner ear and the genetics involved. I will paste a portion below:

Fish have what is known as a Lateral Line along both sides to detect movement, vibration, and pressure gradients in the surrounding water. The Lateral Line is composed of neuromasts (small receptors with hair-like projections which extend into a jelly-like sac ). The Lateral Line pits are found in the fossils of ancient fish as well, dating back hundreds of millions of years ago. The Lateral Line formation is controlled by the gene known as *Pax 2*, and the **same exact gene** is responsible for the formation of the inner ear in **mammals** and the varying levels of auditory ability in **reptiles and amphibians (so all our tetrapods)**

The receptors for BOTH these taxa appears in [amphioxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelet) in the form of hair-like epithelial cells and connecting neurons. Coincidentally, this organism is thought to be the precursor for all chordates.

To put it all more plainly: same gene that controls the formation of the lateral line (detecting prey, orientation, schooling) controls the formation of the mammalian inner ear (modern balance/hearing organ) and the ancestor of BOTH has the genes for the receptor type's origin.

Can we go back any further though?

Box jellyfish are incredibly ""primitive"" animals. They have a sort of ancient eye (unique to sea jellies), but certainly lack any type of ear or lateral line.

What do their genes say? They don't have *Pax 2* (balance/hearing) OR *Pax 6* (sight) but have a single gene for their primitive eyes that is a genetic mosaic of BOTH *Pax 2* and *Pax 6.*

The implication here is that perhaps ancient cnidarians hold the key to the eventual duplication or point mutation that progenated *Pax 2* and *Pax 6* from the precursor mosaic.

So the genetics are in place by the time we reach the Sarcopterygians like Eusthenopteron, what about the physical form? The actual inner ear bones? Eusthenopteron's stapes is nearly in place, and by the time we meet the early amphibian Tulerpeton, the first inner ear bone is in place, although hearing would have been incredibly poor.

With this in mind, we essentially have directional selection and mutation taking advantage of open niches and the safety of a new habitat. Basically, Evolution working as is should. 

**Part 4: Examining the YEC Response** 

Up to bat is my personal go-to for YEC opinion: Answers in Genesis.

Thankfully there is an easily accessible article on their site, one originally posted in the Journal of Creation back in 2003. I was hoping that their primary page on the subject would be a bit more up to date, but we will analyze it anyways.

[Paul Garner, Bsc Environmental Science, is Skeptical](https://answersingenesis.org/fossils/transitional-fossils/fossil-record-of-early-tetrapods-major-evolutionary-transition/)

The very first thing you should notice is the date that this paper was written, 2003, is a year prior to the discovery of perhaps the most important fossil of tetrapod evolution: Tiktaalik (2004). And even with that piece missing, there is quite a bit of floundering going on in this article (pun). 

For instance, Garner presents a very misguided idea of what ""intermediate"" means in the context of a fossil form. Mind you, I have met very few Creationists (anecdotally) who will define what a transitional form would even look like. But here is what Garner has to say: 

"" Evolutionary theory might lead us to expect examples of intermediate *structures*, but there is nothing intermediate about, for example, the internal gills of *Acanthostega*, its lateral line system, or its limbs. They are fully developed and highly complex.""

I wish someone would inform Garner that his idea on Evolutionary theory is incorrect. Evolutionary Theory predicts small morphologic changes accumulating over time thanks to natural selection and mutation. This means **there will never be an intermediate species that is plagued by incumbent or lethal morphologies.** This patently goes ***against*** the entire idea. 

But let's check a more recent article shall we?

[David Menton at it Again(ton)](https://answersingenesis.org/missing-links/is-tiktaalik-evolutions-greatest-missing-link/)

Menton specifically covers tiktaalik here thankfully. But he doesn't go more than skin deep. Essentially Menton argues that tiktaalik is ""still a fish"" (something no one disputes) and that it couldn't walk on it's fins (which is a rather general statement). 

Of course as we covered it is likely that if tiktaalik did move from different bodies of water it would be quite cumbersome, but not impossible. Similar to how modern mudskippers get about.

Menton's argument here boils down to calling tiktaalik a fish and mentioning coelacanth and lungfish to support the idea that fish can do the things tiktaalik can do. He doesn't dare go more than surface level on skeletal changes in the lineage over time. 

But no AiG dive would be complete without the assertion that it's the *evolutionary assumption* that's the real problem. 

[Evolutionary Assumption = Bad](https://answersingenesis.org/missing-links/fish-to-tetrapod-missing-link-found/)

Here we see an unlisted author talk about Ventastega (not covered in this post). This is another transitional form somewhere between tiktaalik and terrestrial tetrapods. The article quotes the actual paper on the finding and rounds itself off with this: 

"" What the scientists in this study did not do, was examine alternative ideas about what *Ventastega* represents. For example, if we start from the Bible—that God created the earth and all animal kinds in six days about 6,000 years ago, then we would likely conclude that *Ventastega*, like *Tiktaalik*, represents both the amazing creativity and economy that God has used in the multitude of diverse designs He made. ""

Essentially, Ventastega doesn't support evolution so long as you start with a worldview that *already precludes evolution as a possibility.*

I don't think I need to go into why this is not science in any shape or form. Beginning with a conclusion is never good in the world of science, be it biology, chemistry or physics. 

**Part 5: TL;DR** 

Tetrapod evolution is well documented in the fossil record and tracks morphologic change from aquatic sarcopterygians to terrestrial tetrapods. Criticisms of these fossils are poor to non existent and can be summarized as a slander of evolutionary theory simply due to it's implications. Valid criticisms point out we still have much to learn about this lineage, particularly in the realm of biochemical change, but this is classified as a lack of evidence in a facet of a well documented biological trend rather than what would be required for a YEC alternative: **evidence to the contrary.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Limestone 101**

Most limestone is made of the [skeletons and shells](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/limestoneLandscapes/whatIsLimestone/howFormed.html) of trillions upon trillions of marine microorganisms. Deposits can be hundreds or even thousands of meters thick. Approximately 1.5 x 10^(15) grams of calcium carbonate get deposited on the ocean floor annually \[[Poldervaart, 1955](https://earthref.org/cgi-bin/err-s3-download.cgi?database_name=err&amp;search_start=main&amp;cit_id=1691&amp;file_id=8053)\]. A deposition rate ten times as high for 5000 years before the Flood would *still* only account for less than 0.02% of limestone deposits.

10% of ALL sedimentary rock is limestone... of which [most is marine](http://people.ku.edu/~stalder/KS-limestone.html). Of the limestone that is NOT, the majority of that is from lakes and ALSO involves microfossils. The only kind that doesn't, is not referred to as limestone under scientific terms, and is formed in hot springs and in cave systems. Of the limestone bands that we have, every one I know of involves: [microfossils](http://geology.isu.edu/Alamo/rocks/limestone.php)

So to summarize so far: **Most rock is sedimentary rock. Of that sedimentary rock, 10% is limestone, and of that 10%, the majority is marine in nature. Marine limestone, to my knowledge, always contains microfossils and thus in the** ***best*** **case scenario (warm, calm waters) will have a depostion rate of 1.5 X 10****^(15)** **, far too slow to explain the layers we currently have (hundreds to thousands of meters thick).**

There are of course, additional problems regarding limestone. 

1. Limestone takes time to form into solid rock, even today. Thus, if all of it were deposited in a single year, the result would NOT be the great, jagged cliffsides of Dover and the Grand Canyon, but gentle sloping. This is due to limestone's slow hardening, which would not be solid by the time the Great Paleolake burst and carved the Grand Canyon as seen in Flood Geology to create said cliffs. Instead, the enormous limestone deposits would slouch pitifully under their own soggy weight until, like a child's paper mache project, they harden.
2. Limestone deposits can be distuinguished as freshwater and saltwater. Freshwater limestone contains *only* freshwater fossil organisms, and saltwater limestone contains *only* saltwater organisms. 
3. Limestone has a strange solubility trend. It is more soluble (dissolves more readily) in cold water. If the Fountains of the Deep were cold, all the lime should be in a single layer on top of all the rest, precipitating out as the water warmed. If the Fountains of the Deep were hot, than all limestone should be near the bottom in a large band, having not been taken up by the surrounding water. Either way, limestone *cannot* be interspersed between clay, silt and sand in these models.
4. Limestone is highly soluble in water as it is, so large bands of limestone cannot be explained by currents carrying deposits from elsewhere either. 
5. Limestone from slow-growing coral and fast-growing coral can be differentiated. As such, enormous coral reef colonies (6000+ years old) in existence *currently*, whose foundations are their calcified ancestors, cannot be explained away as fast-growing coral which proliferated after the flood.

**Limestone Episode V: YECs Strike Back**

Arguments and rebuttals

* [The CMI (Creation Ministries International) Paper](https://creation.com/grand-canyon-limestone-fast-or-slow-deposits)

This paper lists many statistics comparing Calcite (Grand Canyon Redwall) and Aragonite (""Modern Lime Muds"") in an effort to contrast them in such a way that suggests flood geology to be feasible. 

These comparisons are somewhat trivial, as they have nothing to do with the claim the article ends with: 

""There is ample evidence to indicate that the thick Canyon limestones were not formed as today’s lime muds are, by the ‘gentle rain of carbonates’ over long time-spans, but instead were formed by the transport of sediments by currents of flowing water.""

Interesting, but where are the sources? 

Because I can provide a source by *four Christian geologists* definitively remarking the opposite:

""No limestone has ever been documented to form from floodwater-either in a laboratory or from field obervations- not even in floods as massive as those forming the Channeled Scablands in Washington State. Quite simply, limestone is one type of rock that takes a long time to be deposited- much, much longer than the time span of a flood.""

Grand Canyon, Monument to an Ancient Earth (Hill, Davidson, Helble, Ranney)

Furthermore, their example of how ""Modern Lime Muds"" form is also *brazenly* incorrect. Calcite Limestone is forming [right now](https://geology.com/rocks/limestone.shtml), as you read this:

 ""One of these areas is the Bahamas Platform, located in the Atlantic Ocean about 100 miles southeast of southern Florida (see satellite image). There, abundant corals, shellfish, algae, and other organisms produce vast amounts of calcium carbonate skeletal debris that completely blankets the platform. This is producing an extensive limestone deposit.""

How do they think we got a precipitation rate in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

* [The Mudstone Flume Experiment](http://www.shale-mudstone-research-schieber.indiana.edu/mudflume-research.htm)

Similar to Schwietzer's work, the flume experiment at Indiana University has been grossly taken out of context. The experiment proved that sediments of a particular type can be deposited in moving water of a given velocity, created bedload floccules. 

The Creationist idea then, is that if mudstone can be deposited in rapidly moving water, why not limestone? 

[For one, mudstone is classified as entirely unique to limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock), given the former is a ""Mudrock"" and the latter is of ""Biochemical Origin"". This is akin to saying because Macaws have long lifespans, so do sparrows. 

They behave entirely unique to one another. 

But let's say for arguments sake, they behave exactly the same. Floccules are identifiable formations, and as such, all sedimentary rock should be *littered* with them. But they aren't. 

* AiG's Gary Parker and his [""Creation Facts of Life""](https://books.google.com/books?id=jFhCK3LzITgC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CLike+most+Americans,+I+was+mis-taught+in+grade+school+that+it+takes+millions+of+years+and+tremendous+heat+and+pressure+to+turn+sediments+(like+sand,+lime,+or+clay)+into+rock+(like+sandstone,+limestone,+or+shale).+We+all+know+better.+Concrete+is+just+artificial+rock.+Cement+companies+crush+rock,+separate+the+cementing+minerals+and+large+stones,+and+then+sell+it+to+you.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cvRhLTrFud&amp;sig=ACfU3U3JcTZI3qfln0NrUUwp8xmV3U20bg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV-rGQwtvhAhUPWa0KHUbnDkwQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CLike%20most%20Americans%2C%20I%20was%20mis-taught%20in%20grade%20school%20that%20it%20takes%20millions%20of%20years%20and%20tremendous%20heat%20and%20pressure%20to%20turn%20sediments%20(like%20sand%2C%20lime%2C%20or%20clay)%20into%20rock%20(like%20sandstone%2C%20limestone%2C%20or%20shale).%20We%20all%20know%20better.%20Concrete%20is%20just%20artificial%20rock.%20Cement%20companies%20crush%20rock%2C%20separate%20the%20cementing%20minerals%20and%20large%20stones%2C%20and%20then%20sell%20it%20to%20you.&amp;f=false)

 Parker can be quoted in his book with some opinions on limestone. Originally, this bit was on the AiG website, but I suppose they had the good sense to take it down for reasons that are about to become evident:

*“Like most Americans, I was mis-taught in grade school that it takes millions of years and tremendous heat and pressure to turn sediments (like sand, lime, or clay) into rock (like sandstone, limestone, or shale). We all know better. Concrete is just artificial rock. Cement companies crush rock, separate the cementing minerals and large stones, and then sell it to you. You add water to produce the chemical reaction (curing, not drying), and rock forms again—easily, naturally, and quickly, right before your very eyes. Indeed, you can make rock as a geology lab exercise, without using volcanic heat and pressure or waiting millions of years for the results. Time, heat, and pressure can and do alter the properties of rock (including “Flood rock”), but the initial formation of most rocks, like the setting of concrete, is quite rapid.”*

This is misleading. As already covered, limestone forms as a result of calcium carbonate, a compound that exists primarily in microscopic marine organisms, accumulating over long periods of time. For this to happen, these organisms must die and drift to the bottom of the sea. As we also already covered, limestone requires calm, warm waters to precipitate out. The Flood would have been anything but. Finally, let us assume for a moment that hypothetically limestone could be laid down during the flood. How would we explain vast swathes of limestone underneath existing rock layers? 

This fossil formation (all I could find on AiG regarding anything about limestone when I was initially searching) simply rebuffs and avoids the issue. It goes so far as to take concrete, a manmade use of the process of *hydration,* to explain the natural processes of three separate and vastly different rocks forming. Hydration requires dry material. So why is there thick lime on the bottom of all oceans if there was a global flood? If there is evidence supporting fast settling or lay down of these rocks, why not mention it? Because as covered above, no such example currently exists. 

* [ICR Grasping at Straws](https://www.icr.org/article/scientists-prove-limestone-can-form-quickly/)

In this article, ICR argues that because the minerals which make up limestone can form quickly, that means limestone can form quickly. No mention of deposition though, which is the entire issue for flood geology. Or how geologists can tell if limestone is organic (the vast majority) or inorganic (typically relegated to cave formations) and the organic kind requires... well... dead microorganisms which can not ""form quickly"". 

Aside from all that, does this argument sound familiar?

""If the parts can form for something, their final product can form!""

Is this not the exact argument that YEC's so consistently rail against... for abiogenesis? Considering the amino acids necessary for life *have* been proven to form naturally? 

Just food for thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Limestone's precipitation rate is far too slow for to give all the required layers for the Global Flood. In addition, limestone requires calm, warm water, and there is no current flood model to offer an explanation for why such fine particled minerals appear in layers *between* coarse sands and silts.",34,11,1555657196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bew86o/the_trouble_with_limestone_and_why_it_precludes_a/

This is due to our inherent desire to feel apart from nature as it's master, rather than acknowledge our original spot seated firmly in the middle of the Serengeti food chain. There is a humbling that must occur to see oneself in the ancient apes of yesterday, scraping about in the dust of the East African Rift Valley, and yet this past of ours it written in our very bones: from how we walk to how we talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following post will explore this journey from the first true hominid to ourselves, and examine why our evolution is irrefutable morphologically, paleontologically, genetically and archeologically. I will try my best not to romanticize, but this is a topic I am very passionate about so forgive me if I get a bit flowery.

&amp;#x200B;

First, let's quote our friends at Answers in Genesis to set the scene of Human Evolution denial before we attempt to prove it as a fact:

&amp;#x200B;

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

You can explore some of their ideas [here](https://answersingenesis.org/human-evolution/).

&amp;#x200B;

The path to humanity from the first mammal begins with the [plesiadapiforms](http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/primates.htm), specifically, a former resident of Montana named Purgatorius. The development of the Old world monkeys (Cercopothecoids) which led to apes will not be discussed as the topic of discourse is strictly from apes to humans, not old world monkeys. 

 The first relative, and the original perpetrator of habitual (occasional) bipedalism is found in the East African Rift, in what is today Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The East African Rift is the boundary between two tectonic plates that sprawl across Africa and India, which now separate the lush tropical rainforests of West Tanzania and the Congo from the flat Serengeti that dominates where our ancestors first climbed down from the trees out of necessity. So who were these ancestors? **There are some 17 species of well documented Hominids**. 20, if you count some of the less supported fossils.

**The Early Hominids** 

**3 Genera**

Sahelanthropus

Orrorin

Ardipithicus (Kadabba and Ramidus)

**Highly variable**

Bipedal at least habitually (more than chimpanzees and bonobos)

Dentation microwear indicates frugivory and some omnivory

Mostly ape-like

&amp;#x200B;

[**Sahelanthropus tchadensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus) **(7 MYA):** 

Brain case: 300-400

 Sahelanthropus tchadensis is one of the oldest known species in the human family tree. Walking upright may have helped this species survive in diverse habitats, including forests and grasslands, although it definitely spent time in the trees. 

This species had a combination of ape-like and human-like features:

 Ape-like features included a small brain (even slightly smaller than a chimpanzee’s), sloping face, very prominent browridges, and elongated skull.

Human-like features included small canine teeth, a short middle part of the face, and a spinal cord opening underneath the skull instead of towards the back as seen in non-bipedal apes. The spinal cord opening (foremen magnum) is what tells us this animal was at least partially bipedal, although it was likely cumbersome at times due to no in-line big toe! 

Found in Chad

[**Orrorin tugenensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrorin) **(6 MYA)**

Brain Case: 300-400 

Living around 6 million years ago, Orrorin tugenensis is the one of the oldest early humans on our family tree. 

Individuals of this species were approximately the size of a chimpanzee and had small teeth with thick enamel, similar to modern humans.

 he most important fossil of this species is an upper femur, showing evidence of bone buildup typical of a biped - so Orrorin tugenensis individuals climbed trees but also probably walked upright with two legs on the ground similar to Sahelanthropus.

Orrorin is at the base of the human family tree, and has more ape-like features than human-like ones -- except that it walked upright on two legs when on the ground. 

Found in Tugen Hills, Kenya

[**Ardipithicus kadabba**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_kadabba) (5.8-5.2 MYA)

Brain Case: 300-400

Ardipithecus kadabba was bipedal (walked upright), probably similar in body and brain size to a modern chimpanzee, and had canines that resemble those in later hominins but that still project beyond the tooth row. 

One bone from the large toe has a broad, robust appearance, suggesting its use in bipedal push-off.

Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered 11 specimens from at least 5 individuals

Found in Middle Awash in Eithiopia 

[**Ardipithicus ramidus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_ramidus) (4.4 MYA)

Brain Case: 350-400 

The foot bones in this skeleton indicate a divergent large toe combined with a rigid foot – it's still unclear what this means concerning bipedal behavior. The pelvis, reconstructed from a crushed specimen, is said to show adaptations that combine tree-climbing and bipedal activity.

The discoverers argue that the initial ‘Ardi’ skeleton reflects a human rather than a Pan ancestor as Ardi was not chimpanzee-like (bipedality, low sexual dimorphism and higher encephelization).

A good sample of canine teeth of this species indicates very little difference in size between males and females in this species. Ardi’s fossils were found alongside faunal remains indicating she lived in a wooded environment. 

Discovered in Middle Awash Eithiopia 

**The Australopiths (Savannah Bipeds)**

Likely gracile with larger overall size than chimpanzees.

Larger brain size (even accounting for overall size) than chimpanzees

Dentation is megadont and the palate is midway between human and chimpanzee in regard to parabolic shape. Molars getting larger.

Arms still longer than legs, foremen magnum continuing to move ventrally.

More bipedal than the ardipiths, but still some time in trees.

Thick tooth enamel (a human trait)

Still apelike development (rapid infant growth)

[**Australopithicus anamensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_anamensis) (4.2-3.9 MYA)

Complete enough brain case not found, brain cc unknown

Australopithecus anamensis has a combination of traits found in both apes and humans. 

The upper end of the tibia (shin bone) shows an expanded area of bone and a human-like orientation of the ankle joint, indicative of regular bipedal walking (support of body weight on one leg at the time). Long forearms and features of the wrist bones suggest these individuals probably climbed trees as well. 

Found in Kanapoi, Kenya

[**Australopithicus afarensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis) (3.8-2.9 MYA)

450-500 cc brain

Au. afarensis had both ape and human characteristics: members of this species had apelike face proportions (a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw), and long, strong arms with curved fingers adapted for climbing trees. Despite climbing, big toe is almost completely in line, indicating frequent time on the ground as well. 

They also had small canine teeth like all other early humans, and a body that stood on two legs and regularly walked upright with a valgus knee similar to modern man.

Their adaptations for living both in the trees and on the ground helped them survive for almost a million years as climate and environments changed.

Remains from over 300 individuals have been found, and indicate heavy Sexual Dimorphism (perhaps in line with modern chimpanzees)

First found in Hadar, Eithiopia (Lucy)

[**Australopithicus africanus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_africanus) (3.3-2.1 MYA)

480-500 cc brain

Au. africanus was anatomically similar to Au. afarensis, with a combination of human-like and ape-like features. 

Compared to Au. afarensis, Au. africanus had a rounder cranium housing a larger brain and smaller teeth, but it also had some ape-like features including relatively long arms and a strongly sloping face that juts out from underneath the braincase with a pronounced jaw.  

Like Au. afarensis, the pelvis, femur (upper leg), and foot bones of Au. africanus indicate that it walked bipedally (valgus knee and inline big toe), but its shoulder and hand bones indicate they were also still well adapted for climbing. 

Found in Southern Africa (potentially a migratory branch of A. Afarensis)

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Paranthropine Cousins (The ""Robust"" Australopiths)**

Known as the “robust” Australopiths

Brain size slightly larger than their Australopith cousins

Huge megadont teeth (primarily molars) 

Massive zygomatics and sagittal crests in males

Despite being a cousin (and not direct relative) to us, the hominid trends continue: Bipedal (ventral FM), reduced canines, \^ brain, \^ size, almost inline big toe, valgus knee and bowl-trending pelvis.

Differences that make them likely cousins rather than relatives: HIGH sexual dimorphism (males were much larger), Huge zygomatics and sagittal crest, massive molars suggesting a heavily plant based diet. 

**Due to character restraints, the Paranthropines will not be covered in depth. There are three well known species, P. aeithiopicus, P. robustus and P. Boisei (2.7-1.2 MYA)**

They are fascinating though! Check them out and perhaps we can cover them in another post. 

&amp;#x200B;

[**Homo habilis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-habilis) (2.4-1.6 MYA) 

Brain case: 550-700

The first animal classified as genus Homo, rather than an australopithicine. It has reduced prognathism, smaller canines and a smaller brow ridge. It's small, like it's predecessors, but it's body ratio is trending towards human, although the arms are still ""too long"". It was certainly obligately bipedal, due to it's knees and ventral foremen magnum. H. habilis is found frequently with stone tools. Sexual dimorphism is shrinking again, and long species reign shows a broad range of encephilization. Ape like traits include brain case, face morphology (brow ridge and small s. crest still present, prognathism reduced but still accounted for).

[**Homo rudolfensis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-rudolfensis) (1.9-1.8 MYA)

Brain Case: 775

Considered unique from H. habilis, but only recently so. It has unique features not within species variety in the constraints of natural selection: ""larger braincase, longer face, and larger molar and premolar teeth. Due to the last two features, though, some scientists still wonder whether this species might better be considered an *Australopithecus*, although one with a large brain!"" If H. rudolfensis is a transitioning form of H habilis, it likely used tools as well although to my knowledge no direct tools have been found with it.

[**Homo georgicus**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) (1.7 MYA)

Brain Case: 600

 is somewhat controversial in it's ranking. It has a small braincase size for Homo and more ""old traits"": showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between [*Australopithecus*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus) and *Homo erectus*, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Tool use is observed both in finding tools with the specimens and cuts in animals bones found alongside specimens.

[**Homo ergaster**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster) (1.9-1.5 MYA)

Brain Case: 600-910

Also is controversial in it's ranking. It's high cranial diversity and occipital traits make it likely that H. eragaster is either a late transition of Homo erectus or is actually early representations of H. erectus itself. However,*H. ergaster* may be distinguished from *H. erectus* by its thinner skull-bones and lack of an obvious supraorbital foremen, and from *H. heidelbergensis* by its thinner bones, more protrusive face, and lower forehead. Tool use, just as the previous.

[**Homo erectus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) (1.8 MYA- 145,000) 

Braincase: 900-1000

One of the best represented fossils in many regards. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how many due to it's many subspecies and reputation as a highly variable species. It sports unique teeth from modern humans, as well as many cranial features (such as zygomatics). It's brain case is far smaller than even our smallest range for a normal phenotype, and yet, H. erectus settlements show fire use and more sophisticated tools than it's predecessors. This animal is found nearly all over, from Africa to Europe to Asia. It is likely it proliferated into the H. neanderthalensis (we have genetic hybrid bones) Denisovans and H. floresiensis.

And of course for reference, Us!

***Homo sapiens***: 300,000-present

Brain case: 1200-1350 cm SQ, 4-6 ft

Homo sapiens is known to have several traits which place it in genus homo, and a few which make it unique from the others also in it. Tall, lanky posture with enormous brains (focused on the frontal lobe) and advanced tool use. Anatomically modern humans can be classified by lighter build skeletons than their predecessors. Skull is thin-walled and high-vaulted with flat, near vertical foreheads. Reduced prognathism and brow ridges as well, small mandibles and teeth comparatively. Narrow hips support the most efficient biped hominid of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

The trend over all can be seen as so:

**Sahenanthropus, Orroren, Ardipiths**

\-bipedality develops

\-face morphology begins to change

\-bipedality becomes more efficient

**Australopiths**

\-encephilization begins to increase at a faster rate

\-face morphology changes to accommodate brain case

\-Pelvis morphology changes to accommodate brain case size during birth

**Homo**

\-Growth rates slow, and longer adolescence is seen

\-Brain case allows for development of frontal lobe 

\-Frontal Lobe development instigates tool use

\-Tool use eases life, allowing for culture

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a slightly more in depth look at the trends:

  

**- Bipedalism**

a) **How?** Reshaping of the pelvis, knee, ankle, foot and location of the foremen magnum.

b) **Why?** The reason for the journey out of the trees and onto the ground has been subject of dispute for decades. The current theory suggests that the East African Rift split separated a population of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees/Bonobos, leaving the latter in a flatter, less-forested Savanah and the former in the lush jungles. This forced the ancient hominids from the dwindling trees and onto the ground, where the grass was tall and seeing over it (to locate predators) was invaluable. We know they already *could* stand and walk bipedally (all great apes today *can* for periods of time) it became a matter of doing it often. Those who could, survived to reproduce and we see a trend of Bipedality. Additionally, this freed the hands for carrying young, bringing food back to a “home base” and later, tool use. 

\- **Brain size** 

a) **How?** Reducing prognathism and the size of teeth and expanding the brain case.

b) **Why?** Intelligence increases fitness! But then, why do we not see this in other species? We do see a trend for increasing “smarts” in some, such as cetaceans or the great apes, but upping intelligence takes mutation and an environment that selects for it heavily. It is difficult to see it evolve in a lifetime. 

**- Culture** 

a) **How?** Increasing intelligence and social relationship dependency.

b) **Why?** With intelligence comes empathy and existential questions. These three factors lead to the development of new innovations for survival (smarts), Helping the downtrodden members of the group (empathy) and the advent of burial and symbolism (existential questioning). 

**Other factors such as** 

\- Loss of hair: Humans are one of the most efficient animals in the world at avoiding overheating by dissipating it through sweat.

\- Speech: We sacrificed the ability to eat and breath at the same time for advanced vocal cords. Human babies’ larynx match adult chimpanzees until juvenile development.

\- Loss of Sexual Dimorphism: Human partition work more equally due to a more minute difference in the genders (5-11% dimorphic)

\- Dental adaption: Loss of canines and increased molars came with brain size increase, and the smaller teeth came to no detriment as we began to use tools.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: We're All Damn Dirty Apes (Closing)**

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

Sorry Answers in Genesis. This is abjectly false. 

Human beings are bipedal, intelligent hominids that reign supreme on this Earth in regards to dominion over every other species. We are all encompassing on this planet and using our powerful brains and ability to hunt persistently we managed to rise from the grasslands of East Africa and become the formidable species the world sees today. **We are not just a part of nature, we are the very essence of it.** A perfect story of evolution yielding an unstoppable (not necessarily a good thing) force. 

Humans are animals. But what separates us from other organisms is our intelligence and our incredible empathy. Neither are totally unique to us, but no other animal sees it in the spades we do. Humans represent a beacon of emotion and passion and artistry. We create endless symphonies, sculpt mighty megaliths and write epic tales that wind through time and generations. We learned to navigate using the stars and reached every continent, and when the sea was sated we created planes to explore the sky. The gravity of our planet couldn’t even hold us back as humans journeyed into the stars and set foot on the moon above. We craft medicines and cure diseases, suck oil from the ground to power our cars, build towers that scrape the belly of the sky. Humans care deeply for one another, and for other species as well, domesticating animals that once hunted us for the sake of companionship. We stand apart in the Animal Kingdom as creatures forged in the dust of the Savanah and gifted with the spark of curiosity. We don’t learn so that we may survive, we survive so that we may learn more about this grand, extravagant world we roam. 

TL;DR Through the 17 + Hominids of the fossil record, we see morphologic trends that connect humans and our ancestors. These trends bind us to the animal kingdom and allow us to peer into our rich ancestry as we try to learn more about ourselves.

DebateEvolution,bdgi5m,IJustCouldntThinkOk,,t2_jo5nfvm,self.DebateEvolution,,Why the fall makes no sense.,"In this post I’m going to cover 3 points against the creationist argument of the fall:

1. The Law Of Infinite Probability.

The Law Of Infinite Probability states that if something can happen, given enough time, it will happen. This is a reason that the punishment is unjustified, if I didn’t want to grow a beard I wouldn’t grow one, but if I was immortal I (eventually) have to because I have infinite time for this event to trigger, but if I was unable to grow a beard, I wouldn’t grow one. Because we know Adam and Eve (according to the fruit) ate the fruit we know it’s possible therefore they (or one of their children) will have ate the fruit.

2. Free will.

According to most creationists we are the only living thing with free will (unless you include angels), this means that the serpent must have been following God’s will instead of its own, I know what you’re thinking; the serpent was Satan, the reason this argument doesn’t work is because the serpent is referred to as its own character, making the claim that it was Satan less likely “*Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made*. He said to the woman, ""Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?""” (Genesis 3:1). The only way you can disregard this argument would be to give animals credit of consciousness.

3. Right from wrong.

God gives Adam and Eve the only rule to follow (don’t eat from the tree of knowledge), however the Serpent told Adam and Eve they were not to be punished if they were to, instead that they would to be like God (knowing the difference between right and wrong). The fact Adam and Eve didn’t know right from wrong would be a reason they could trust the Serpent, Adam and Eve would not know the serpent was lying over God because they had no trust hierarchy (which would require knowledge between right and wrong) to tell who would be more likely to lie.",0,16,1555337908,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdgi5m/why_the_fall_makes_no_sense/
DebateEvolution,bdcgoz,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Transitional Species Handbook: Birds are the Definitively Living Descendants of a Lineage of Theropod Dinosaurs,"Let's talk about the little dinosaurs we see every day. 

The current near-universal consensus among paleontologists is that birds evolved from a group of dinosaurs known as Theropods. 

YEC website Answers in Genesis, [very much disagrees](https://answersingenesis.org/dinosaurs/feathers/did-dinosaurs-turn-into-birds/). This article was written by David Menton, who is not a paleontologist. He makes some very broad claims about the nature of our knowledge of bird evolution, most notably, that we do not have *any* feathered dinosaur fossils outside *Archaeopteryx lithographica, w*hich Menton insists is a true bird. 

In the following post, we will explore the dozens of transitional forms between ancient scaled theropods and modern birds, including A. lithographica, who is definitively **not** a ""true bird"" as Menton suggests. Near the end we will touch on the molecular evidence as well. 

**Part 1: The Recipes for Non-Avian Dinosaurs and Modern Birds**

In the realm of systematics, we have traits that classify organisms as one taxa or another. Below are the criteria of non-avian dinosaurs (in this case, theropods) and of Modern Birds. This is important to keep in mind as we examine the transitional forms because, as you will see, a neat line *cannot* be drawn to distinguish birds as a separate ""kind"" from their theropod ancestors. 

**Non-Avian Dinosaurs (Theropods)**

* Scales, or a mixture of feathers and scales
* Non-keeled sacrum, and non-flexible shoulder joints
* Unfused Pelvis
* Comparatively heavier bones
* Teeth
* Grounded (not capable of flight)
* Bony Tail
* Gastralia (Unique to Sphenodons and Crocodilians, a rib attachment site)

**Modern Birds**

* Feathers
* Keeled sacrum and flexible shoulder joints
* Fused Pelvis
* Hollow, lightweight bones
* Beaks without teeth 
* Primarily flight capable
* Pygostyle
* No Gastralia 

Thus the evolutionary lineage should roughly look like so: **non-feathered theropods &gt; feathered non-avian dinosaurs &gt; archaeopteryx &gt; transitional birds &gt; birds**

Let's dive in!

(Some listed are species, some are genera)

**Non-Feathered Theropod Likely Relative**

[Compsognathus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compsognathus) (Late Jurassic): Almost entirely like a “normal dinosaur”. Like most theropods (but NOT living birds) Compsoganthus had many classic traits: Bony tail, skull with teeth, gastralia, midway bird/saurian hip, no feathers and theropod vertebra. BUT this animal also had a **semilunate carpal (wrist)** which is only seen in bird relatives and modern birds. This bone is actually the primary bone necessary in the downward flight stroke in avians today. 

[Semilunate Carpal](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06042)

**Non-Avian Feathered Theropods** 

[Eosinopteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinopteryx) (Late Jurassic): Non-Flight capable, but covered in down with proto primary feathers on wing it also has a semilunate carpal but lacked any other modern characteristics.  Like most theropods, it had a non-fused pelvis and non-keeled sacrum but it is one of the first examples of feathers in theropods chronologically. 

[Anchiornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchiornis) (Late Jurassic): Potentially a Microraptor relative, due to the proto-wings on both arms and hind legs, which had **primary AND secondary feathers** but no barbules so no flight. The wing is a mosaic of traits of theropod arm and the wing seen in archaeopteryx lithographica. Semilunate carpal present. The first to have more lightweight bones comparative to it's size.

[Sinosauropteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx) (Early Cretaceous): Covered with a coat of simple filament-like  feathers whose coloration has actually been preserved in some specimens, indicating a reddish brown banded color for the animal. Excellent preservation has also shown this species has a more crocodilian-style respiratory system NOT as closely related to Archaeopteryx as some others to be covered, and is in fact likely a direct relative to compsognathus according to some paleontologists. Lightweight but not hollow bones and the ever present semilunate Carpal.

[Protarchaeopteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protarchaeopteryx) (Early Cretaceous): Well developed vane-style feathers from tail and a member of the oviraptors, (thus a step closer to Archaeopteryx). This animal had **hollow bones and emergence of wishbone** as well as the semilunate Carpal! NOT flight capable though, due to symmetrical feathering (modern birds with symmetrical feathers are not flight capable either, such as ostriches and emu.) 

[Sinorthosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinornithosaurus) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Feathers most similar to modern birds thus far: a down like covering over the entire body, with arms almost converted entirely to wings. However, not flight capable, as the wings only have the primary barbules, not the secondary. Full wings combined with hollow bones and semilunate carpal indicate gliding may have been possible and small size as well as fossil location indicates arboreal lifestyle. Micro-cell analysis agian gives pigment to feathers, giving the animal a yellow-brown-black color. Sinorthosaurus had a **wishbone and birdlike shoulder** semilunate carpal and the first to exhibit a **transitioning pelvis** (to fused).

[Caudipteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudipteryx) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Lineage of winged, feathered grounded dinosaurs with less advanced arm wings than Sinorthosaurus, however, primary feathers are arranged as in modern birds. ""Primitive"" body skeleton, but with hand and wrist transitioning towards archaeopteryx. Body is comparable to MODERN flightless birds with: uncinate rib processes,very few and reducing teeth, and a partially reversed first toe. Semilunate carpal and wishbone still present.

[Beipaiosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beipiaosaurus) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Largest “for-sure” feathered dinosaur found with more advanced down feathers, arm-feathers (not quite wings though) and tail plume feathers 4-7 inches long. Beipaiosaurus had a large skull, lightweight bones and transitioning pelvis as well as semilunate carpals and a wishbone. 

[Microraptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microraptor) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Four winged dinosaur likely capable of at least gliding and likely flight due to the wings and skeleton. **Primary and secondary flight feathers on large wings** just like modern birds, semilunate carpal, advanced **nearly perfectly modern bird shoulder, hollow and light bones.** Flight was likely somewhat cumbersome however, in comparison to modern birds due to a *not-QUITE* modern shoulder, disallowing full modern motion. Theropod traits still present: teeth, claws and bony tail as well as a non-fully keeled sacrum and a partially fused pelvis

[Zhenyuanlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhenyuanlong) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): The first to have a fused Sacrum (derived) but still has the unfused pelvis (primitive). Short arms (non-flight capable) but advanced wings, bringing questions as to the initial purpose of wings, and what may have driven their evolution. This species lack hindlimb feathers, has a semilunate carpal, wishbone, transitional pelvis and a tail that is analogous to *Archaeopteryx lithographica*. 

[Mei Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_long) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Feathered with down covering the body and somewhat ""primitive"" wings. Famous for death during sleep, and it's fossilized posture is identical to modern birds: neck tucked under the wing. This behavior further links birds and theropods. Mei Long had teeth, a bony tail (with feathered end), and was certainly grounded due to small arms/wings.

**Archaeopteryx lithographica:** [The Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx)

This species is found in the Late Jurassic, notably earlier than some of these ""less derived"" theropods listed above. This is an excellent example of the branchy, bush-like nature of emerging adaptions in species. A trait may appear in several lineages and take entirely different directions. For instance, today the feathers in ostriches and emu are used for balance while running, not unlike Caudipteryx may have done. 

The post is illustrating the nature of *evolutionary trends.* We see many different iterations of feather types, wing types and skeletal posture, but the trend is still the same: **feathers initially evolved and persisted in theropod dinosaurs in a time period in which birds do not appear in the fossil record** (Late Jurassic, ""Modern Birds"" show up in the Cretaceous). These new adaptions try all sorts of things in varying forms, but inevitably trend towards the successful morphology seen in modern birds. 

So. What about Archaeopteryx. Is Menton correct? Is Archaeopteryx a ""true bird""?

**Absolutely not.** 

Let's do a trait check in shall we? 

**""True"" Theropod:**

* Bony tail 
* perforated skull with teeth
*  theropod vertebra and shoulders
*  gastralia (rib formations exclusive to dinos)
* A pelvis transitioning, but still more similar to that of a theropod 
* Theropod ankle with a short hallux

**Archaropteryx lithographica:**

* Bony tail is present but SHORT compared to all other theropods
* Teeth are present but un-serrated, unlike all other theropods, but skull is perforated and theropodian
* Big toe is fully reversed (Modern Birds)
* Wishbone, fused collarbone and modern bird shoulders
* Unique modern feather symmetry suggesting more even flight

**""True"" Birds:**

* Pygostyle instead of bony tail
* Non-perforated ""avian"" skull
* NO teeth (egg teeth are not actual teeth, and are developmentally unique from true teeth)
* Varying toe reversal
* Wishbone, fused collarbone and shoulders
* Modern feather symmetry 

Is it a transitional form? Or a ""True Bird""? Most certainly it is not the first species to wear feathers. Many theropods possessed these incredible structures prior to Archaeopteryx and some 50 species of decidedly non-avian dinosaurs had feathers (including the many mentioned).

**The reason Archaeopteryx is transitional is supported by it’s many mosaic traits that place it as more advanced than those previously mentioned but still primitive to modern birds.** 

But enough about the transitional form poster child, let's continue onward. 

**Transitional Birds: Denizens of the Mezozoic**

[Rahonavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahonavis) (Late Cretaceous): Indeterminate as to whether this animal is a member of avialae (birds) or a dromeosaurid, as arguments have been made for both. Still maintains many theropod traits including the tail, teeth, skull shape and some vertebral elements, but was certainly flight capable and had many of the derived traits as well (semilunate carpal, wishbones, fused skeletal elements etc). Some have proposed Rahonavis to be a relative of A. lithographica directly.

[Confuciornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confuciusornis)(Mid to Late Cretaceous): Most primitive bird relative to have a **beak**, however, skull was still predominantly theropodian in nature with nasals to the side of the snout etc.Although, the beak shape along with transitioning orbits are looking more modern. We see a pygostyle rather than bony tail but large claws tip the wings. 

[Sinornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinornis) (Mid to Late Cretaceous): More “advanced” than archaeopteryx in that it has a more modern bird-like pelvis, has teeth however, as well as clawed wings. Extremely modern skull lacking in most theropod perforations and capable of perching with modern bird derivations of the feet and legs. More modern blade-shaped shoulder blades as well, although we aren't quite at modern birds. 

[Ichthyornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyornis) (Late Cretaceous): Most modern bird on the list so far. This animal has almost entirely modern bird traits, save the teeth it still possesses. Was likely a sea-faring bird who utilized it’s teeth in hunting given fossilized location. 

**And upon losing these small teeth, we arrive at modern birds.** 

Looking at the pictures of these fossils will reveal what Menton seems to have entirely ignored or simply not researched: Dozens of theropods have feathers and Archeopteryx lithographica is certainly NOT a true bird. 

But Menton has his reasons I suppose. While he *could not have possibly seen the fossils* (benefit of the doubt, lest we accuse him of flagrant dishonesty) he has a number of logistic problems in his proposal. Let's review and address them now. 

**Part 2: I know Why the Caged Archosaur Sings**

Alternative title: Menton's Lament(on)

&amp;#x200B;

1- **Birds are Endotherms, Dinosaurs are Ectotherms**

*""Seemingly forgotten in all the claims that birds are essentially dinosaurs (or at least that they evolved from dinosaurs) is the fact that dinosaurs are reptiles. There are many differences between birds and reptiles, including the fact that (with precious few exceptions) living reptiles are cold-blooded creatures, while birds and mammals are warm-blooded. Indeed, even compared to most mammals, birds have exceptionally high body temperatures resulting from a high metabolic rate."" -Menton*

When one bisects a theropod bone, they find that the bone is immensely more similar to mammalian (endotherm) and avian (endotherm) bone than it is to that of modern reptilian ectotherms! UCMP researchers have been working on dinosaur bone *histology* (the thin-sectioning of bone to see its structure). And their work suggests that dinosaur growth rates are far more consistent with those seen in endotherms.

[And more recent research](https://www.livescience.com/46293-dinosaurs-had-in-between-blood.html) seems to suggest most dinosaurs weren't ectothermic at all, but were actually mesoderms. Precisely what we would expect to see for an ""intermediate"" between birds and non-dinosaurian reptiles. 

2- **A Hugely Concerning Misnomer Misadventure ft. David Menton (and the AiG Gang)**

alternative title: Bird hip/Lizard hip

***""*** *All dinosaurs are divided into two major groups based on the structure of their hips (pelvic bones): the lizard-hipped dinosaurs (saurischians) and the bird-hipped dinosaurs (ornithiscians). The main difference between the two hip structures is that the pubic bone of the bird-hipped dinosaurs is directed toward the rear (as it is in birds) rather than entirely to the front (as it is in mammals and reptiles). But in most other respects, the bird-hipped dinosaurs, including such bizarre creatures as the armor-plated ankylosaurs and the horned ceratopsian dinosaurs, are even less bird-like than the lizard-hipped, bipedal dinosaurs such as the theropods. This point is rarely emphasized in popular accounts of dinosaur/bird evolution."" - Menton*

&amp;#x200B;

It is widely thought that birds evolved from Theropods, known “lizard-hipped” Dinos. This is a bit of a misnomer, and the answer to why lies in the ornithischians. “Bird” hips actually evolved twice, a concept called Convergent Evolution. So lizard-hipped theropods eventually diverged a group with functional bird hips, and simultaneously, ornithischians walked the earth with their own “bird” hips. 

Why does Menton not know this? Why does he assume that the initial bird-hipped dinosaurs evolved into birds, and a type into google would have cleared this up? 

&amp;#x200B;

3- **A Theropod in the Hand is worth Two in the Bush**

alternative title: The Digit Issue

*""One of the main lines of evidence cited by evolutionists for the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs is the three-fingered “hand” found in both birds and theropods. The problem is that recent studies have shown that there is a digital mismatch between birds and theropods. Most terrestrial vertebrates have an embryological development based on the five-fingered hand. In the case of birds and theropod dinosaurs, two of the five fingers are lost (or greatly reduced) and three are retained during development of the embryo. If birds evolved from theropods, one would expect the same three fingers to be retained in both birds and theropod dinosaurs, but such is not the case. Evidence shows that the fingers retained in theropod dinosaurs are fingers 1, 2, and 3 (the “thumb” is finger 1) while the fingers retained in birds are 2, 3, and 4"" -Menton*

This problem seems to be a bit of a semantic one as there is no ontogenical (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive. Basically, no one agrees because they aren’t even sure they’re talking about the same thing. Also this is not one of the main lines of evidence.

4- **David Menton versus the Respiratory System** 

  *""While fossils generally do not preserve soft tissue such as lungs, a very fine theropod dinosaur fossil (Sinosauropteryx) has been found in which the outline of the visceral cavity has been well preserved. The evidence clearly indicates that this theropod had lung and respiratory mechanics similar to that of a crocodile—not a bird.6 Specifically, there was evidence of a diaphragm-like muscle separating the lung from the liver, much as you see in modern crocodiles (birds lack a diaphragm). These observations suggest that this theropod was similar to an ectothermic reptile, not an endothermic bird."" -Menton*

 Sinosauropteryx is listed as an example to refute the avian lung/air sac appearance as well as flight, given it had feathers and small arms. But sinosauropteryx is a compsognathid, and not a true member of the bird lineage. It is an example belonging to the aforementioned group of non-avian dinosaurs which had feathers but never yielded birds. Additionally, Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor of Ohio University. In theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) flexible soft tissue air sacs likely pumped air through the stiff lungs, as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said 

5- **Feathered Folly** 

alternative title: David Menton pretends feathered dinosaurs don't exist and no one knows have feathers evolved

""Structures described as “protofeathers” in the dinosaur fossils Sinosauropteryx and Sinithosaurus are filamentous and sometimes have interlaced structures bearing no obvious resemblance to feathers. It now appears likely that these filaments (often referred to as “dino-fuzz”) are actually connective tissue fibers (collagen) found in the deep dermal layer of the skin. Feduccia laments that “the major and most worrying problem of the feathered dinosaur hypothesis is that the integumental structures have been homologized with avian feathers on the basis of anatomically and paleontologically unsound and misleading information.”

Firstly, see the above list to examine the numerous feathered dinosaurs Menton doesn't cover. And ALSO note something odd: Mention suggests Sinosauropteryx's feathers are simply collagen. But we can chemically examine these structures enough to *discern their color* using methods for *feathers, a structure made of keratin.* Collagen cannot be, for instance, red with brown bands, yellow or black. At least not any that I have seen. 

*""If birds evolved from dinosaurs or any other reptile, then feathers must have evolved from reptilian scales. Evolutionists are so confident that feathers evolved from scales that they often claim that feathers are very similar to scales. The popular Encarta computerized encyclopedia (1997) describes feathers as a “horny outgrowth of skin peculiar to the bird but similar in structure and origin to the scales of fish and reptiles.”12*

*In actual fact, feathers are profoundly different from scales in both their structure and growth. Feathers grow individually from tube-like follicles similar to hair follicles. Reptilian scales, on the other hand, are not individual follicular structures but rather comprise a continuous sheet on the surface of the body. Thus, while feathers grow and are shed individually (actually in symmetrically matched pairs!), scales grow and are shed as an entire sheet of skin.*

*The feather vane is made up of hundreds of barbs, each bearing hundreds of barbules interlocked with tiny hinged hooklets. This incredibly complex structure bears not the slightest resemblance to the relatively simple reptilian scale. Still, evolutionists continue to publish imaginative scenarios of how long-fringed reptile scales evolved by chance into feathers, but evidence of “sceathers” eludes them."" -Menton*

 As it turns out, the evolution of feathers from scales is not all that complicated. Essentially, elongated filaments appeared first on Theropods, followed by down and eventually body and flight feathers. This seems like a complicated process, but scales develop from a structure called placode. This structure, when “on” genetically, produces scales, but if “off” a ring of fast-growing cells on the top of the placode builds a cylindrical wall that becomes a bristle. We see in birds the bristle undergoes development and becomes a fully fledged feather66. But the point is that once a filament is evolved via scale mutation, feathers are not far off! This is very contradictory to Dr. Menton’s idea that the structures are vastly different, and yet this is a well founded and observable phenomenon. How so? Birds still have scales that remain “on” genetically on their legs! 

**Part 3: To Briefly Mention Mary Schwietzer** 

In all the hubub Creationists make about Schwietzer's work, they seem to ignore one of the major aspects of her findings regarding ""soft"" tissue in fossils. She discovered medullary bone in her female Tyrannosaur. This is was previously found ONLY in **modern gravid birds.** 

Once again linking even the most classically ""scalely"" theropods to the sparrow outside your window or the terrifying Canadian geese heckling you on your daily walk. 

**TL;DR**

Modern birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs, and both are considered archosaurs. This is known through the dozens of transitional forms, molecular data and behavioral similarities preserved taphonomically. 

Normally, I would list here how this could be refuted, but I don't really think it can be done in this instance. To refute this you would need to find direct evidence for Progressive Creation, and I am not exactly certain how that could even be done. 

Besides, rejecting such a  fine example of evolutionary lineage and molecular support is **for the birds anyways.**",39,6,1555306538,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdcgoz/transitional_species_handbook_birds_are_the/

(long),"Let's talk about the major extinctions, shall we? Because they are quite problematic if you are a Young Earth Creationist.

In conventional science, there are typically 5 recognized Mass Extinction events. Extinction events can be defined as ""widespread and rapid decrease in the [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism). It occurs when the rate of [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction) increases with respect to the rate of [speciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation)."" ([Wikipedia, Extinction Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event))

These five extinctions events are written, saturnine, in the rocks. We can imagine a rich fossil shelf like the Burges Shale, immediately followed by a barren strip of sparse layering as biodiversity has plummeted. This is of course, what we find. Five times, actually, and each with additional identifiers that tell us part of the story of ""what happened"" to these organisms and their formerly flourishing ecosystems. 

Now, many Creationists have differing opinions on many different things. But one connecting factor (to my knowledge, a universal one in this ideology) is that **all of the rock layers and fossils above the Vishnu Schist (the lowest granite layer of the Grand Canyon) were deposited by the global Noachian Deluge which occurred somewhere between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE in approximately one year's time.**(depending on the used YEC chronology).

What can be inferred then, is that the cause of death of nearly every fossil we find is impact from the wall of water or drowning. 

But the nature of how layers are deposited and the taphonomy behind the deaths of these organisms present issues, especially in the light of those found in death assemblages during mass extinction events. 

Let's tackle the glaring issues first.

**The Extinction Events: An Overview**

**1)** **Ordovician-Silurian**

&amp;#x200B;

**444 mya**, approx. 86% species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause**: a short, severe ice age that lowered sea levels, possibly triggered by the uplift of the Appalachians. The newly exposed silicate rock sucked CO2 out of the atmosphere, chilling the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we know this?**: Isotope analysis of Oxygen in [brachiopods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018297000631) and [conodonts](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5888/550) show us that this period experienced a serious cooling event! [It turns out](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/isotope.html) Isotopes can reveal climate. Similar to runaway greenhouse effects, this ""mini"" Ice Age entered into a feedback loop as more exposed silicate cooled the planet, freezing more water and exposing more silicate. 

**YEC Problems:** Isotope analysis alone is problematic for YEC site Answers in Genesis, which proposes a single Ice Age post-Flood. But logistically this is a problem for all YEC's. The organisms that died in the Ordovician Extinction littered the seafloor as they perished, supposedly representing the first to die in the Noachian Deluge en masse. But their own shell's isotopes indicate they died due to the ice that was beginning to creep down from the poles. 

Walt Brown, YEC producer of the Hydroplate Hypothesis, invokes supercritical fluids to explain the deposition of so many layers of rock. Supercritical fluids occur at HIGH temeratures, not the more chilled waters the millions upon millions of sordid shells indicate. 

Added is the obvious looming problem of ""ecologic sorting"". If habitat is to blame for the layering of the fossil record, why do we find ANY seafloor dwellers fossilized past this point? Why are the cetaceans and mosasaurs and MAJORITY of trilobites so much higher in the record?  

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Devonian-Carboniferous** 

&amp;#x200B;

**375** million years ago, 75% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** Colonization of land by plants allows roots to stir up the earth, releasing nutrients into the ocean. This might have triggered algal blooms which sucked oxygen out of the water, suffocating bottom dwellers like the trilobites.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we this?:** So vascular plants have risen to the land and doomed their distant eukaryotic brethren in the sea (including the poor trilobites). Sapping the oxygen from the sea, they created mass [anoxia](https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/5/3/pdf/gt9503.pdf) which can be seen int eh chemical analysis of laminated black shale and in the lack of free O2 in the sediment. 

**YEC Problems:** Anoxia is usually caused by algal blooms (due to eutrophic conditions) of organic-walled plankton and the like. Anoxic death in marine organisms is resultant from the lack of O2 in the water. There is **no means** by which to suggest that a flood can correlate or cause Anoxic Conditions, as the rough seas would *discourage* algal growth and destroy any land plants. The marine organisms should show cause of death linked to blunt force or burial, and the entire ocean would certainly not become anoxic in the conditions described in Genesis 6-7. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **End of Permian** “The Great Dying”

**251 million years ago**, 96% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** A perfect storm of natural catastrophes. A cataclysmic eruption near Siberia blasted CO2 into the atmosphere. Methanogenic bacteria responded by belching out methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Global temperatures surged while oceans acidified and stagnated, belching poisonous hydrogen sulfide. “It set life back 300 million years,” Rocks after this period record no coral reefs or coal deposits.

**How do we Know This?:** Each of the factors are documented in the fossils and the rock and are abjectly not copacetic with a global deluge as the cause. First is the magma/igneous residue from the eruption of the [Siberian Traps](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9). We can track this also through the rapid introduction of isotopically light carbon found in the marine system. Second, we see the [anoxia](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04132) again. And finally is the fact that after these two events subside geochemically the biodiversity in the fossil record is absolutely decimated. Again, no ancient coral. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems:** Here we also see the death of the majority of the Synapsids, Dicynodonts, Pelycosaurs etc. These animals occupied the same niches the dinosaurs would come to takeover, meaning their habitats are the same and the fossils are in the same location but separated by geologic time. Some of these guys outwieghed some of the dinosaurs. So why are they so deep below them in the sediment? Hydrologic sorting cannot explain why a tyrannosaur would be above a gorgonopsid, as the former SHOULD sink below if they are indeed killed at the same time. And as I mentioned, their habitats are nearly identical, so Ecologic sorting cannot either. 

Equally as problematic is the notion of the anoxia (again) and the severe volcanism. You see, the noxious output by the Siberian Traps encouraged methanogenic bacteria to flourish. Today, modern methanophiles live in harsh conditions such as **under the permafrost or in the soil of arid deserts.** 

They do NOT thrive in floodwaters, or in a global inundation. 

The coral are problematic as well. After this geochemical marker in time, they dissapear and the taxa which are killed off never make a reappearance. However, they are succeeded in the SAME habitats by different coral (soft corals) which survived the Permian Event thanks to the lack of their calcareous parts. So the Flood Geologist must come up with a hydrologic sorting method which can model why the waters patterned the corals as such, since no modern floodwaters have been observed sorting SOME organisms by size/weight/habitat, and not others. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4) End of Triassic** 

&amp;#x200B;

**200 million years ago**, 80% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** As of 2017, Volcanism is suggested, but this is a more contended issue. The disappearance of 80% of known life in the fossil record is abrupt and left few clues, but a 2017 paper examines one of the larger ones: Mercury.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we Know This?**: [Mercury Levels!](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/7929) These coincide with enormous volcanic events, suggesting another potential anoxic event. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems**: You may be noticing a pattern of anoxia here. Before you entertain the hypothesis that the flood triggered this O2 sap somehow and attribute it as another unifying Flood condition, allow me to present an issue. [The Geological history of Oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen) on the planet shows *fluctuations.* The most damning to this particular idea is the fact that insects enjoyed insanely high O2 numbers in the Carboniferous... which is seated between two periods of mass anoxia. 

The volcanistic nature of the End-Triassic is problematic due to the ash residue, which is **terrestrial** in nature. Meaning the volcanoes were not acting up underwater, but belching cinders into the air.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Cretaceous-Cenozoic**

**66 million years ago,** 76% of all species lost.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Likely cause:** Impact event that left the ) Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico. Killed all the dinosaurs, and all tetrapods over 55 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we know This?**: [The Iridium Layer!](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X81900558) Iridium is an element that is *supremely rare* on Earth, but notably common in meteors and asteroids. There is a global band of this element found at the K-T boundary, the same layer that the Chixulub crater is found in. This layer is quite unique, as it represents a fuzzy border between the time of the dinosaurs and the time after them. This has always been the prevailing theory, but a [recent hubub](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) has been made over supposed further confirmation thanks to a new dig site. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems:** The nature of meteorite impacts is well known. We can tell by the size of a crater how large the object was, how fast it was going and it's composition. The crater at Chixulub is not indicative of a meteor which would have to penetrate sea levels higher than the Himalayas. 

There are arguments of course that the Himalayas are a *result* of the flood and perhaps the waters were lower at the time of the Chixulub impact. The question then becomes something a bit more problematic. 

The layers that make up the Jurassic and Cretaceous would have been laid down *late* in the Flood. This means The Chixulub impact was also late during the flood. Since we find the Jurassic dino fossils right underneath the Iridium Anomaly, we now face some issues. If the dinosaurs died this late in the flood, what did they eat while swimming for nearly a year? What about the dinosaurs not capable of swimming (looking at you carnotaurus)? if they were dead and simply not deposited yet, why are they all *articulated together?* Submergence in water lends a body to breakdown and the bones would be separately buried, not in a death-pose. 

Thus the dead dinos must have been *terrestrial* at the time of death. This final issue on the last extinction alone precludes the Global flood based solely on principles of Taphonomy, let alone in the light of everything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary + Closing**

While these events clearly create enormous problems for a Global Flood, little was said specifically on the Young Earth Nature. I am hopeful that seeing these events in tandem makes it clear that they could not have all occurred in 6000-10000 years simply due to the required ecologic recovery time. Additionally is the simple argument of [radiometric dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) on the rocks formed during these time periods. 

The Mass Extinctions are incredibly displays of the fickle nature of our world.

Hey guys, first of all i am by no means an expert in theory of evolution but there was a guy i found who pointed out that evolution (not adaptation) is highly improbable and he argued that many scientists believe in it in a biased and ill informed way.

Here is what he told me (i will try my best to present his argument as accurately as possible):

First he started by saying the **improbability** of evolution happening from a purely stats point of view. He talked about probability of protein developing, and rants on about given the time scale of the universe and the ""primordial ancestor"" to form, the probability of that happening is very close to zero and that evolution makes no sense if it came from a common ancestor.

Second, he says that the way genetics work is that genes do not increase capacity size with each generation. If we start from a cell with a given genetic code, it does not evolve into something with more codes. it only evolves by changing its code or reducing it's coding size. Having said that, the only way for a common ancestor to make sense is that it should have began with an extremely complex code which statistically is very very small, again given the lifetime of the universe, will not make it possible even assuming that the proteins that form the gene does not degrade with time. If the ancestor started as a simple organism, then it is impossible for it to evolve to complex beings like what we see today since genes don't evolve from simple genes to complex ones.....yes, he ""ran"" the probability numbers and they are really really small for evolution as we know it to be true.

Thus he doesn't believe that evolution as we know it makes sense. He doesn't have his own explanation but he **entertains the idea that there was a prime mover** to start life (**God**). Yes, he is a Christian. He is knowledgeable in biology and (naturally) chemistry. I'm just a physics guy so I can't really refute his arguments. They do sound convincing though since I'm quite ignorant in biology (sorry). I suspect he may have misconceptions somewhere in his reasoning and maybe bias (my opinion). but then again, im hoping that there are some experts here to clear the air.

The guy and I chatted on a discord server where we (the community) talk about religion, atheism and other stuff. We'd be happy if you can give your two cents because that question was left hanging in the air for MANY weeks. Many christians there just rolled with him but some reject even adaptation (the guy doesn't). I though it's finally time to get to the truth. i dont mind if im wrong and he is right. what matters is that we learn stuff. PM me for the discord server link. Or write your answers here.

I'd really appreciate your inputs or your interest in debating directly with him in the discord server. not sure if it's appropriate to post the link here so pm me.

DebateEvolution,bagp3c,Ziggfried,I watch things evolve,t2_515go,self.DebateEvolution,,Ancestral protein reconstruction is proof of common descent and shows how mutable genes really are,"The genetic similarity of all life is the most apparent evidence of “common descent”.  The current creationist/design argument against this is “common design”, where different species have similar looking genes and genomes because they were designed for a common purpose and therefore not actually related.  So we have two explanations for the observation that all extant life looks very similar at the genetic level: species, and their genes, were either created out-of-the-blue, or they evolved from a now extinct ancestor.  

This makes an obvious prediction: either an ancestor existed or it didn’t.  If it didn’t, and life has only ever existed as the discrete species we see today (with only some wiggle within related species), then we shouldn’t be able to extrapolate back in time, given the ability.  Nothing existed before modern species, so any result should be meaningless.

Since I didn’t see any posts touch on this in the past, I thought I’d spend a bit of time explaining how this works, why common descent is required, and end with actual data.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is Ancestral Protein Reconstruction**
&amp;nbsp;

[Ancestral Protein Reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_sequence_reconstruction), or APR, is a method that allows us to infer an ancient gene or protein sequence based upon the sequences of living species.  This may sound complicated, but it’s actually pretty simple.  The crux of this method is shared vertical ancestry (species need to have descended from one another) and an understanding of their relatedness; if either is wrong it should give us a garbage protein.  This modified [figure](https://imgur.com/dNJCiFh) from this [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418793/) illustrates the basics of APR.

In the figure, we see in the upper left three blue protein sequences (e.g. proteins of living species) and, if evolution is true, there once existed an ancestor with a related protein at the blue circle and we want to determine the sequence of that ancestor.  Since all three share the amino acid A at position 1, we infer that the ancestor did as well.  Likewise, two of the three have an M at position 4, so M seems the most likely for that position and was simply lost in the one variant (which has V).  Because we only have three sequences, this could be wrong; the ancestor may have had a V at position 4 and was followed by two independent mutations to M in the two different lineages.  But because this requires more steps (two gains rather than a single loss), we say it’s less parsimonious and therefore less likely.  You then repeat this for all the positions in the peptide, and the result is the sequence by the blue circle.  If you now include the species in orange, you can similarly deduce the ancestor at the orange circle.  

This approach to APR, called maximum parsimony, is the simplest and easiest to understand.  Other more modern approaches are much more rigorous, but don’t change the overall principal (and don’t really matter for this debate).  For example maximum likelihood, a more common approach than parsimony, uses empirical data to add a probability each type of change.  This is because we know that certain amino acids are more likely to mutate to certain others.  But again, this only changes how you infer the sequence, and only matters if evolution is true.  Poor inference increases the likelihood of you generating a garbage sequence, so adjusting this only helps eliminate noise.  What is absolutely critical is the relationship between the extant species (i.e. the tree of the sequences in the cartoon) and ultimately having shared ancestry.

There are a number of great examples of this technique in action.  So it definitely works.  [Here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34594) is a reconstruction of a highly conserved transcription factor; and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095102/) the robustness of the method is tested.

&amp;nbsp;

**The problem for creation/ID**
&amp;nbsp;

In the lab, we then synthesize these ancestral protein sequences and test their function.  We can then compare them to the related proteins of living species.  So what does this mean for creationists/IDers?  Let’s go back to the blue and orange sequences and now assume that these were designed as-is, having never actually passed through an ancestral state.  What would this technique give us?  Could it result in functional proteins, like we observe?

The first problem is that the theory of “common design” doesn’t necessarily give us any kind of relatedness for these sequences.  Imagine having just the blue and orange sequences, no tree or context, and trying to organize them.  If out of order, the reconstructed protein will be a mess.  Yet it seems to work when we order sequences based upon inferred descent.  That’s the first problem.  

But let’s be generous and say that, somehow, “common design” can recapitulate the evolutionary tree.  The second, more challenging problem is explaining how and why this technique leads to functional, yet highly-divergent, proteins.  In the absence of evolution, the protein sequence uncovered should have no significance since it never existed in nature.  It would be just a random permutation of the extant sequences.  

Let’s look at this another way: imagine you have a small 181 amino acid protein and infer an ancestral sequence with 82 differences relative to known proteins (so ~45% divergence), you synthesize and test it, and low-and-behold it works!  (Note, this is a real example, see below.)  This sequence represents a single mutant protein among an absolutely enormous pool of all possible variants with 82 changes.  The only reason you landed on this one that works is because of evolutionary theory.  I fail to see any hope for “common design” here, especially if they believe (as they often insist) proteins are unable to handle drastic changes in sequence.

From the perspective of design, we chose a seemingly random sequence from an almost endless pool of possibilities, and it turned out to be functional just as evolution and common descent predicts.

&amp;nbsp;

**Protein reconstruction in action**
&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I thought I’d end with a great paper that illustrates all these points.  In [this](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10147) paper, they reconstruct several ancestors that span from yeast to animals.  Based upon sequence similarity alone, they predicted that the GKPID domain of the animal protein, which acts as a protein scaffold to orient microtubules during mitosis, evolved from an enzyme involved in nucleotide homeostasis.  Unlike the cartoon above, they aligned 224 broadly sampled proteins and inferred not one, but three ancestral sequences.  

The oldest reconstruction, Anc-gkdup, is at the split between these functions (scaffold vs. enzyme) and the other two (Anc-GK1PID and Anc-GK2PID) are along the branch leading to the animal-like scaffold.  Notably, these are very different from the extant proteins: according to Figure 1 S2, Anc-gkdup is only 63.4% identical to the yeast enzyme (its nearest relative) and Anc-GK1PID is only 55.9% identical to the fly scaffold (its nearest relative).  Unlike the cartoon above, these reconstructions look very different from the starting proteins.

When they tested these, they found some really cool things.  First, they found that Anc-gkdup is an active enzyme!  With a KM similar to the human enzyme and only a slightly reduced catalytic rate.  This confirms that the ancestral function of the protein was enzymatic.  Second, Anc-GK1PID which is along the lineage leading to a scaffold function, has no detectable enzymatic activity but is able to bind the scaffold partner proteins and is very effective at orienting the mitotic spindle.  So it is also functional!  The final reconstructed protein, Anc-GK2PID, behaved similarly, and confirms that this new scaffolding function had evolved very early on.

And finally, the real kicker experiment.  They next wanted to identify the molecular steps that were needed to evolve the scaffolding capacity from the ancestral enzyme.  Basically, exploring the interval between Anc-gkdup and Anc-GK1PID.  They first identified the sequence differences between these two reconstructions and introduced individual mutations into the more ancient Anc-gkdup to make it look more like Anc-GK1PID.  They found that either of two single mutations (s36P or f33S) in this ancestral protein was sufficient to convert it from an enzyme to a scaffold!

*This is the real power APR.*  We can learn a great deal about modern evolution by studying how historical proteins have changed and gained new functions over time.  It’s a bonus that it refutes “common design” and really only supports common descent.  

Anyway, I’d love to hear any counterarguments for how these results are compatible with anything other than common descent.

**TL;DR**  The creation/design argument against life’s shared ancestry is “common design”, the belief that species were designed as-is and that our genes only appear related.  The obvious prediction is that we either had ancestors or not.  If not, we shouldn’t be able to reconstruct functional ancestral proteins; such extrapolations from extant proteins should be non-functional and meaningless.  This is not what we see: reconstructions, unlike random sequences, can still be functional despite vast sequence differences.  This is incompatible with “common design” and only make sense in light of a shared ancestry.",19,25,1554646858,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bagp3c/ancestral_protein_reconstruction_is_proof_of/

Many natural phenomena that we have a rational, natural explanation for today were once attributed to the gods.  I don’t wish to belabour the point, but a few examples include [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_personifications_of_seasons), yet hopefully everyone here accepts seasons are a result of the tilt of the earth. Weather events such as [thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thunder_gods) has also been attributed to gods.  We can continue this ad nauseam if you wish, but I think these two examples illustrate the point.

Science has reliably been shrinking our knowledge gaps without any evidence of a supernatural being that plays an active role in the universe. If we’d stopped trying to explain events back when seasons were attributed to gods, we would still be living in caves and certainly wouldn’t be debating over science that has essentially been solved for 150+ years. There is much left to learn about and discover, to me that’s infinitely more exciting / fascinating that ‘god did it’, so we can forget about problem X.

My question to the creationists, is how do you justify arguing that abiogenesis can be attributed to a god? I fail to see how this is not simply moving the goal posts of the rapidly shrinking god of the gaps argument. If a supernatural being interfered in the universe it stands to reason that we will never be able to understand what methods they used, so at what point do we cease scientific research, I assume not when humans still thought gods were responsible for the seasons.

To these ""geniuses"" (one of them has a flair saying he is a member of Mensa, most likely to overcompensate for his inability to show that he has any genius-like qualities in his posts), science does not deal in absolutes. This is not wishful thinking. This is an article that describes observations made, then tries to explain what those observations are, then tries to make a conclusion based on those observations. That's how these scientific articles work, and how they've been working for hundreds of years.

From Lyell to Darwin to Wallace to Watson and Crick, important papers and discoveries still had terms such as ""might have"", ""could have,"" ""maybe,"" even ""assume,"" as they were working toward proposing conclusions based on observations and not asserting that they had to be correct because they wanted to be. Not one of those scientists started with a preconceived notion and tried to force the conclusions, contrary to what creationists often do.

What science does that works so well, and that creationism constantly fails at, is that when these proposed conclusions are made, they can be **tested**. Others can take the work, do their own verification of the observations, and either reach the same conclusion or propose their own. And so far, much of that work since their time has shown that their underlying conclusions are very much true.

Creationists, stop doing yourself a disservice by trying to argue that a paper with maybes, could-haves, etc., means that it's just wishful thinking. It's how science operates: Scientists make observations, try to explain those observations, and propose a conclusion to fit those observations **without** just assuming that their conclusions must be correct.

DebateEvolution,b9mpg6,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Egyptian Chronology and How it Precludes a Global Flood (And Also a 6000 year old Earth),"A complaint I have seen proposed before is that we can't know anything about the past before humans because there were no humans to witness the event. ""You can't know, you weren't there!"" This is an actual defense put forth by actual adults at the head of certain Young Earth Creationism websites. 

My minor in undergrad was Anthropology, primarily Bioanth (human evolution) but we had to take a fair bit of cultural anth. as well, and I chose to spend my time in an Egyptology Lecture. So much of my knowledge is based off of the textbook ""An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt"" by Bard, and ""A History of Ancient Egypt"" by Mieroop (from 2015 and 2010 respectively). 

So in this post we're going to examine how Egyptian Chronology is problematic for a literal Genesis interpretation, and also WHY we know the Chronology is sound. I am by no means an Egyptologist, but I am using sources written recently by very good ones, so if you have more in depth questions I would recommend checking them out. 

**Part 1: Egyptology 101**

Ancient Egypt is located where modern Egypt is today, in Northwest Africa hugging the Nile river. It can be separated into several time periods: Naqada 1-3 (Also known as the Predynastic Period), Old Kingdom, First Intermediate, Middle Kingdom, Second Intermediate, and the New Kingdom. 

We primarily care about the Predynastic Period and the Old Kingdom in this post, the reasons being the former begins the concept of Regnal years (how long a Pharaoh ruled) and the latter sees the building of the Pyramids of Giza. 

**Part 2: The Naqada Problem**

Radiocarbon dating is a double edged sword for many YEC's. On one hand, it can corroborate certain biblical events as well as the consistency of parts of the modern text. On the other hand, Naqada 1 begins in 4400 BC according to the multiple radiocarbon dates of fossil remains of humans and other animals, grains and reeds. This is outright problematic because using Lightfoot's age of 6000 years old, this enormous culture would be creating pottery, jewelry, their own religions, and trading with the equally large Nubia in a vacuum. 

It becomes more problematic when Naqada 3 rolls around with the advent of writing systems and Regnal Years with which to record history. These writing systems are the first hieroglyphs, and in conjunction with graphic narratives on palettes, they begin to record the first Kings. This will become more relevant in a moment. 

**Part 3: The Flood and the Pyramid Problem**

The Pyramids of Giza were *not* the first pyramids of Egypt. Human ingenuity is an incredible thing, but usually requires some trial and error. The first even remotely successful pyramid was built by the stubborn Pharaoh Sneferu (2613-2589 BC). He messed up several (leaving behind the odd-ball Bent Pyramid) before a success with the Red Pyramid (the first true Egyptian Pyramid) before his death. 

Sneferu was succeeded by three kings in a series, obsessed with pyramids. Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. Each built one of the Great Pyramids of Giza and filled them with goods for their afterlives. 

This means the three pyramids of Giza were all finished, along with the two other standing pyramids of Sneferu, the Sphinx and hundreds of Mastabas (large funerary monuments of past Kings) by the year **2490 BC at the latest.** 

These pyramids and monuments were covered with enormous, vain inscriptions of the Pharaohs who built them, including stone Steeles, cattle and grain counts and trade information. 

Answers in Genesis, a YEC websites, places Noah's flood in the year **2348 BC**. **This is 142 years AFTER the pyramids were built.** 

**This means the Egyptian monuments, which are today falling apart from time alone, survived a global deluge which was supposed to shift tectonic plates and form the entire current geologic record. These limestone monuments somehow avoided being buried under thousands of feet of sediment, and survive to today with zero water damage evident.**  

**Then, after said flood, Noah's kin repopulated, removed to Egypt and picked up** ***precisely*** **where the Egyptians had left off before perishing in the Global Flood.** 

They deciphered and learned the hieroglyphics, accepted the Egyptian Pantheon, picked up the Regnal Kings list where Menkaure left off, and *never ever mentioned a global deluge.* 

Of course, this is ridiculous. This is beyond impossible. So, AiG and others have decided not that Noah's Flood may have been localized or perhaps allegorical, but that Egyptian Chronology is *wrong.* 

Does this claim have any validity? Could Egyptian history be off enough to accommodate the YEC dates?

**Part 4: No, it couldn't. Egyptian Chronology is Solid.**

So let's entertain for a moment the possibility that Egyptian History begins after Noah's Flood. That Naqada 1 starts then. How is our population looking for those stats? 

Not Great, is the answer.

Assume human population doubling time as AiG does for many divergences from the flood which is a double of population every 20 years. Mind you, this is with NO MORTALITY and NO FAMINE, PLAGUE, WAR.

160 years after the Flood date AiG gives, Egypt was “founded” (2188 BC)… **with a total of 2048 people in the WORLD.** 

In 2234 BC, AiG says Babylon was founded. This is 114 years after the Flood. **The total WORLD population would be 512.**

**Under the occasionally used doubling rate, it is simply not possible given these WORLD populations are shared with: Sumerian, Assyrian, Akkadian, and Babylonian civilizations and any and all small traveling bands, tribes and budding societies. Additionally, numerous civilizations are dated to this time period around the GLOBE.** 

Not to mention if this is the population rate used, who is building these massive structures? There aren't enough hands. 

But back to the point: Egyptian Chronology is solid. Why? 

There are many reasons. 

First is the **Regnal years.** We can count back using King's Lists and figure out just how long each Pharaoh ruled for. Using this method, we arrive at ruling dates for the Sneferu and company which are THEN confirmed with radio carbon dating the organic material in the pyramids (namely, reed mats and wood).

**Secondly**, we can cross reference this with cattle censuses and festivals (such as the Sed festival or Apis Bull celebrations). These festivals are recorded in ceremonial papyrus writings, and the censuses are recorded as well, as a matter of bureaucracy. 

**Third, we can corroborate with OTHER nation chronologies.** If Babylon's king mentions Egypt's Pharaoh, and the regnal year counts for both indicate the same time period, we can be assured of the method and the Chronology. Egypt HAS this, in the form of the [Amarna Letters](https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/), diplomatic communications between the royalty of the Kingdoms of Mesopotamia  (Babylon, Hatti, Egypt, Mitanni and Assyria)

Fourth, is dendochronology corroboration. Using wood from Egyptian monuments and ships (Uluburan shipwreck, Sneferu's Cedar Ship) we can count rings back and obtain dates as well. 

Fifth is Radiocarbon Dating. This one is interesting, because Answers in Genesis is known for rejecting it as a dating method outside of the very recent. Interestingly enough, they have kindly given us a maximum for radiocarbon dating's efficiency and it's 5730 years. The vast majority of Egypt's history falls inside these constraints and supports **conventional Egyptian Chronology.** 

**Part 6: TL;DR**

The history of ancient Egypt is but a single example of archaeologic findings which present what I find to be insurmountable problems for Young Earth Creationism. Furthermore, to accept a global flood one must cling to a universally panned alternative chronology (with it's own insurmountable problems) or the idea that the pyramids could survive a flood without damage, and the people who resettled the location simply picked up where the former left off.

* **Radiometric Dating: An Overview**

Radiometric dating is not subjective in any sense. It is simply a method of determining precise dates based on the Physics principle that as time passes atoms of a particular chemical element will spontaneously change into atoms of a different chemical element. This is a firm law in physics: The **Radioactive Decay Law.** It additionally covers the nature of decay constants and half-lifes and indicates that to our current knowledge: **decay rates do not change in meaningful ways in nature on our planet.** 

Radiometric Dating can be done in a variety of ways and usually involves decay types: beta decay, alpha decay and electron capture.

* **YEC attempts to Discredit Radiometric Decay Rates.** 

The RATE team (an Institute for Creation Research group) was deployed specifically to refute this. And what they found is that decay rates cannot be changed in meaningful ways (that is, significant enough to propose 6000 years) on our planet.  

That RATE group has been discontinued since 2005, and in their book on their findings the group of YEC scientists **“admit that a young-earth position cannot be reconciled with the scientific data without assuming that exotic solutions will be discovered in the future. No known thermodynamic process could account for the required rate of heat removal nor is there any known way to protect organisms from radiation damage.”** 

Carl Wieland of AiG (Answers in Genesis, a YEC site) had this to say as well: "" When physicist Dr Russell Humphreys was still at Sandia National Laboratories (he now works full-time for ICR), he and Dr John Baumgardner (still with Los Alamos National Laboratory) were both convinced that they knew the direction in which to look for the definitive answer to the radiometric dating puzzle. \[new paragraph\] Others had tried—and for some, the search went on for a while in the early RATE days—to find the answer in geological processes. **But Drs Humphreys and Baumgardner realized that there were too many independent lines of evidence (the variety of elements used in ""standard"" radioisotope dating, mature uranium radiohalos, fission track dating and more) that indicated that huge amounts of radioactive decay had actually taken place.** It would be hard to imagine that geologic processes could explain all these. Rather, there was likely to be a single, unifying answer that concerned the nuclear decay processes themselves""

In all the history of radiometric dating, the maximum change in decay in a laboratory environment was 1.5%  in 1999 by altering environmental conditions chemically. ***To date, no evidence for perturbation in the decay constant of any geologically important radioactive isotope has been found.*** 

This has left a large problem for YEC's. Humphreys of the RATE team makes a *tacit admission* that the induced accelerated decay that has been experimentally performed (in elements not related to radiometric dating mind you) are ""minuscule compared to the million-fold or greater acceleration of decay rates which is required by the evidence for a young Earth"". He then suggests ""we should not be surprised if we find evidence that God has supernaturally intervened"". 

**So what we have here is the admission that without supernatural intervention the Earth's age appears to be ancient.** 

* **The Heat Problem for Accelerated Decay**

Let us for a moment grant Young Earth Creationism accelerated decay. What would happen if we were to compress 4.8 billion years of radioactive decay into 6000 years?

A Tufts University Geologist [did the math](http://chem.tufts.edu/science/geology/adam-eve_toast.htm)

At the time of Adam and Eve according to YECs, the **surface of the Earth would be 70,000 degrees C** for every square kilometer. At the time of Jesus's birth, assuming a generous geothermal gradient we would be at **400 degrees C** for every square kilometer. 

* Woodmorappe (YEC) and ""Fallacies"" 

John Woodmorappe has given some input on Radiometric Dating as well (although he does openly admit he doesn't at present have an answer for the ancient Bristlecone Pines). He has three fallacies which he uses to ""combat"" Radiometric dating methods. Let's review his fallacies here.

1. CDMBN or ""Credit Dating methods for frequent success, but Blame Nature for failures"" 

Woodmorappe seems to have this idea that geology is constant and without anomaly. He sees thousands upon thousands of correct and corroborated dates (through multiple methods) each year, but if a single date is strange and geologists remark that it may be a new phenomena it's suddenly fallacious. This is precisely what happens in Evolutionary Theory or Paleontology when a date changes. It's only okay in non-origin related science for change to occur. 

2.   ATM or ""Appeal to Marginalization""

Woodmorappe essentially repeats the first ""fallacy"" and notes that blaming anomalous circumstances is a cop out of sorts. He points to Rb-Sr dating (despite that this method has been largely abandoned for methods with less room for error, for example, SHRIMP for isotope analysis). He completely disregards the very nature of geology: to understand anomalies. Not to mention once anomalies are understood and accounted for, the margin or error shrinks.

3. ATT or ""Appeal to Technicalities"" 

Human error is not a factor in Woodmorappe's world. 

&amp;#x200B;

All three of these ""fallacies"" amount to one statement: ""If incorrect dates are obtained, even rarely, the method must be thrown out entirely.""

&amp;#x200B;

**On Discordant Dates**  


The crux of the argument from a YEC perspective appears to hinge on discordant dates. Four U-Pb methods can yield four dates, and may be unique from a K-Ar age obtained from the same rock. To them, this seems suspect at worst and faulty at best. And from a laymen perspective this is somewhat reasonable. But the simple truth is that these methods are not measuring the same event, and were not intended to do so. K-Ar in this case measures the cooling time of the particular crystalline sample, while the U-Pb or Sm-ND methods are measuring the ""whole-rock"" isocron. Thus these dates SHOULD be discordant. 

At worst, discordant ages suggest that geology could be understood more thoroughly and perhaps aren't as precise as we might wish. 

Occasionally (of the hundreds of thousands of tests) discordant dates have occurred that have not been understood. That is, we cannot readily attribute them to human error or known anomaly. This should grant YEC's little solace however, as almost invariably these dates are millions too billions of years old even in their discordancy. 

There has, to my knowledge and research, never been a rock body which has yielded a date in the millions and a date under 6000 years. They are almost invariably ALL ancient. 

Complaints notwithstanding, YEC's ignore the fact that concordant dates make up the vast majority of samples tested. Meteorites of iron and stone, individual or clustered and from all over the globe have been dated with Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, Lu-Hf, Re-Os, Ar/Ar and EVERY kind of isochron and have ALL yielded dates of 4.4-4.6 billion years. 

Or consider the terrestrial samples. Here are the dates given by various methods for the Isue Greenstone Belt in Western Greenland on varying rock types in a sing;e location:

U-Pb and Rb-Sr : 3.66-3.77 billion years 

Sm-Nd: 3.74 billion years

Pb-Pb: 3.81 billion years

U-Pb and Pb-Pb: 3.70 billion years

You should see this and get the idea that this rock formation as a whole was probably completely formed around 3.7 billion years ago!

**Corroborated by other methods**

The rock dates using varying elements corroborate one another, but in addition to this they are ALSO matched up against Ice cores, dendochronology and ancient coral reefs. Here, they match as well.

Or perhaps we can look at how the movement of plate tectonics [match as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ayuvj4/radiometric_dating_is_corroborated_by_plate/)!

**Concerning Evolutionary Theory**

If we could not confirm the ancient age of the Earth, perhaps one could make the argument for ""Common Design"" when looking at the similar forms of connected lineages across the fossil record. But once the Earth can be definitively called old, ""Common Design"" falls meekly to ""Common Descent"". 

We see fossils of animals dated as having lived long ago with skeletal traits matching those appearing after it, perhaps slightly altered. The habitat can be confirmed as similar or different by the plant life, illuminating why an animal might have changed or remained similar morphologically. 

Traits that might have been ""Common Design"" become inherited traits, as seen in cetacean evolution.

Whale evolution begins with **Indohyus**, an artiodactyl from the early Eocene. Why is indohyus even relevant to cetacean evolution? After all, it has four limbs under the body, a rostral pair of nostrils, hooves, a short skull, conical tail, bulky shape and not much else. Except... it does have a unique trait: the involucrum, mentioned in the video. This is a bony middle ear structure which is today, UNIQUE to cetaceans and no other animal. Additionally, Indohyus has bone density similar to Hippos, the most genetically close relative to cetaceans in living organisms.

Next in the Eocene is **Pakicetus**. More wolf-like, Pakicetus has a narrower snout, and has lost the characteristic dental trait of mammals: specialization of the teeth, and a deducible dental formula. Instead, it has the conical teeth most carnivorous cetaceans have. Now this animal has webbed feet rather than hooves. How do we know it's related to indohyus? It has the **ARTIODACTYL KNEE**, complete with troclear hinges. This is stunning, because no carnivorous animal today HAS artiodactyl knees... but all cetaceans have the remnants of them. Pakicetus ALSO has the **involucrum.**It's bone chemistry suggests a freshwater lifestyle with excursions into, but not permanent living in, the water.

**Ambulocetus** arrives on the scene next, Mid-Eocene, and resembles a large mammalian crocodile. Bone analysis shows a delta-lifestyle with some time in saline and some in freshwater. It also has the **artiodactyl knee** and the **involucrum**, but unlike pakicetus, ambulocetus is beginning to grow sluggish on land. It's hindlimb structure is just not conducive to terrestrial locomotion.

Later in the Mid-Eocene we see **Rodhocetus.** Like it's predecessors, we AGAIN have the **involucrum** and the **artiodactyl knee**. This guy has a new cetacean-only trait in the making: four of it's sacral vertebra are partially fused. In cetaceans today, ALL the sacral vert. are fused. This animal has a bone density of saltwater exclusivity, and has nostrils beginning to move up dorsally. This is not surprising, as we now have the pressure to breathe without the effort a rostral nostril would require.

**Dorudon** in the mid-late Eocene is next. Still, **involucrum** and **artiodactyl knee.** Now the sacrum is fully fused as well, and the nostrils are MORE dorsal than before. Eyes have moved laterally (versus mammalian binocular vision) and some paleontologists have suggested the existence of tail flukes. Hind limbs are still ""useful"" in and of themselves, but gone are the webbed feet: it has flippers.

**Basilosaurus** is enormous and nearly a full cetacean. It has all of Dorudon's traits (including that i**nvolucrum and the artiodactyl knee**) as well as it's general streamlined shape. The blowhole is even more dorsal in comparison though, and the hind flippers are all but internal. The braincase is still somewhat small from the social cetaceans of today though. But for intents and purposes, this is a near-cetacean.

Modern cetaceans arrive soon after, along with Aetiocetus (the progenator of baleen). They have the **involucrum, artiodactyl knee** remnants, dorsal blowholes, streamlined shapes, internal hindlimbs and are entirely aquatic.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we are seeing is change in form over vast swatches of time. When seen in conjunction with the change in form** ***happening today*****, it becomes wholly evident that animals have always, are currently, and will always evolve.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts and TL;DR**

Radiometric Dating has withstood immense scrutiny due to it's implications and has come out on top each and every time. It has proven itself, via basics laws in Physics, to be an accurate means of determining the age of rock (and thus our world) and is a very succinct means to deny YEC as a hypothesis. It also serves as a means to further confirm Evolutionary Theory, displaying ancient organisms changing form over time based on varying environmental change.

DebateEvolution,b6sa02,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationist Claim: Killifish have short life cycles and their eggs can survive in dry environments, are therefore evidence for creation.","[That's the claim.](https://answersingenesis.org/aquatic-animals/fish/rapidly-reproducing-killifish-defy-evolution/) 

That whole piece is worth reading to get the whole argument, but the abbreviated version is that these fish have two traits that are problematic for evolution:

1) They live in temporary environments (seasonally dry out), so they reproduce extremely rapidly (some reach sexual maturity in as little as two weeks). 

2) Their eggs can survive the drying and have been observed to stay viable for up to three years. 

The overall claim is that evolution is insufficient to explain these traits. Putting aside the problem of concluding ""therefore God did it"" without any evidence to that effects, let's examine whether these claims are actually a problem. The piece says:

&gt;evolutionists have no reasonable explanation.

You may be surprised to read that this...is not the case.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's start with the rapid life cycle. Time to sexual maturity is what's called a ""life history trait,"" which are things like lifespan, number of offspring, offspring per little, number of reproductive events, and...time to sexual maturity (among other things). 

Life history traits heritable, and are very sensitive to selective pressures imposed by ""extrinsic mortality,"" which are factors that cause early death, such as predation, disease, or the loss of one's habitat. 

One well-studied example is how the presence of the transmissible cancer called devil face tumor disease has affected the lifespan and speed of maturation of Tasmanian devils. Without the disease, they reproduce at about 24 months old. But the disease reduced the average lifespan to around 18 months. So they're extinct now, right? Nope. In affected populations, it now takes about 12 months to reach sexual maturity. 

Basically, the thing causing extrinsic mortality imposes directional selection for traits that promote reproduction before death. We can observe it in lots of species, including some nifty experiments with fish living in environments with and without predators. 

These particular fish are living under extremely strong selection for fast maturation. So only the alleles that allow for fast maturation persist. 

The authors of the linked piece argue this had to all be in place to survive in this environment at all, but let me tell you: That isn't true. All that was needed was variation, where some small fraction of the population reached maturity fast enough to not go extinct in this environment. It wouldn't need to be many. A similar dynamic played out in Australia a while back, when researchers tried to use a deadly virus to kill all the rabbits, because they were taking over. In the first year, over 98% of the rabbits died from the virus. Success, right? Nope. The survivors had inherent resistance, genetically, and all their offspring were also resistant. So within two or three years the population bounced back. 

Same deal here. Maybe only a small fraction of the population could mature anywhere near the time it now takes. But if that fraction could survive, selection could do its thing and push them faster and faster. 

So that's the rapid maturation side. Easily explained by high extrinsic mortality. Which we see. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next are the eggs resisting drying out. 

I don't know if the authors know this but...there are a lot of eggs that do that. I know *they* don't think amniotes evolved, but...amniotes evolved. If you read the [actual paper](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.2001.280.1.R123) on the mechanism of survival, you'll see that the authors found some very specific traits in the proteins in the envelope surrounding the the embryo that contribute to retaining moisture in dry environments. Traits that have to do with protein structures that, I don't know, might be the result of selection acting on genetic diversity in the alleles coding for those proteins? I'm not sure how much of this paper the AiG authors read, but they sure didn't seem to consider the very cool work done by those researchers, because they claim:

&gt;Killifish eggs have a yet-unknown mechanism in their plasma membranes that causes them, to dehydrate very slowly.

Which is, let's say, not a very informative characterization of the work I've just described. 

I'm going to leave it there, because when AiG says ""and nobody knows the mechanism for X"" and cites a paper where the authors figure out a bunch of how X works, we're set. No mechanism? The paper you cited explains most of what's going on. Do better, AiG.

&amp;nbsp;

So once again, we have a very confidence claim, this time from AiG, that doesn't hold up under scrutiny, at all. Such is life. ",25,50,1553829183,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b6sa02/creationist_claim_killifish_have_short_life/

[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190122114851.htm) goes into it a bit more:

&amp;#x200B;

""""The times of speciation we can now calculate on the basis of the new rate fit in much better with the speciation times we would expect from the dated fossils of human ancestors that we know of,"" explains Mikkel Heide Schierup from Aarhus University.

The reduction in the human mutation rate demonstrated in the study could also mean that we have to move our estimate for the split between Neanderthals and humans closer to the present.

Furthermore, the results could have an impact on conservation of the great apes. Christina Hvilsom from Copenhagen Zoo explains:

""All species of great apes are endangered in the wild. With more accurate dating of how populations have changed in relation to climate over time, we can get a picture of how species could cope with future climate change.""

The study ""Direct estimation of mutations in great apes reconciles phylogenetic dating"" has been published in *Nature Ecology and Evolution* and is a collaboration between researchers from Aarhus University, Copenhagen Zoo and Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.""

I find it particularly interesting that it could potentially move UP the emergence of Neanderthals and Archaic Humans from H. heidelbergensis. This is the first example to my knowledge, since the reduction of the Sahelanthropus split, that we have moved a speciation even UP in the hominid timeline. 

Of course another implication here is that if humans did **NOT** diverge from a branch of hominids leading back to S. tchadensis this is **incredibly coincidental.** It suggests that the mutation rates of the  Great Apes **simply appear** to corroborate the hominids. 

I suspect a potential argument might propose that this somehow separates humans and the great apes more given the differing mutation rates, but that effectively requires a line to be drawn in the hominid lineage. This means the proposer would need to classify all the ""muddles-in-the-middle"" so many Creationists avoid entirely.

On the surface, this seems flat-out impossible. Birds are an incredibly diverse group of creatures (we have ostriches, pigeons, vultures, hawks, shrikes, crossbills, parrots and ducks) living in a variety of locations (vultures soar over the African savannah, the Phillipine eagle hunts sloths in its rainforest home, and Darwin's finches run the gauntlet from seed-eating to insectivorous to vampiric). By comparison, crocs universally live near large bodies of water to keep themselves fed and cooled off and there's very little deviation with regard to their anatomy. The easiest crocodilian to differentiate from other crocs would be the gharial since its jaws are shaped like tweezers (male gharials have an oddly-shaped knob on the end of their snouts). 

The evolutionary explanation is that birds and crocodiles are part of the same clade (Archosauria - all dinosaurs and pterosaurs are also members of this clade) and evolved divergently from a common ancestor. This is supported by genetic evidence as per the linked article and the study within it. Do creationists have a counter-explanation for this that is testable and reproducible, per the requirements of the scientific method? I suspect not, but I'm willing to change my mind on this.

DebateEvolution,b5k9sv,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,"The Evolution of the Inner Ear (Or, the ""Zoo in You"")","The evolution of the auditory ossicles is a story that most think begins in the synapsids (early amniotes of the late Carboniferous, sometimes referred to as the ""Mammal-Like Reptiles""). We picture the classic dimetrodons lumbering about the early forests, it's anterior mandible beginning to separate and differentiate into what would become the mallus and the incus. 

These synapsids already had their stapes though, the most interior of the inner ear bones. When did this happen? How? What about the nature of hearing itself? 

We begin our story in the genes of our deep sea relatives. In order to swim ""upright"" and maintain position in the water, fish have what is known as a Lateral Line along both sides. The Lateral Line is composed of neuromasts (small receptors with hair-like projections which extend into a jelly-like sac ). The Lateral Line pits are found in the fossils of primitive fish as well, dating back hundreds of millions of years ago. The Lateral Line formation is controlled by the gene known as *Pax 2*, and the **same exact gene** is responsible for the formation of the inner ear in **mammals** and the varying stages of the prototypes in reptiles and amphibians. 

The receptors for BOTH these taxa appears in [amphioxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelet) in the form of hair-like neurons. Coincidentally, this organism is thought to be the precursor for all chordates.

To put it all more plainly: same gene that controls the formation of the lateral line (primitive balance organ) controls the formation of the mammalian inner ear (modern balance/hearing organ) and the ancestor of BOTH has the genes for the receptor type's origin. 

Can we go back any further though?

Box jellyfish are incredibly ""primitive"" animals. They have a sort of ancient eye (unique to sea jellies), but certainly lack any type of ear or lateral line. 

What do their genes say? They don't have *Pax 2* (balance/hearing) OR *Pax 6* (sight) but have a single gene for their primitive eyes that is a genetic mosaic of BOTH *Pax 2* and *Pax 6.* 

The implication here is that perhaps primitive cnidarians hold the key to the eventual duplication or point mutation that progenated *Pax 2* and *Pax 6* from the precursor mosaic. 

So the genetics are in place by the time we reach the Sarcopterygians like Eusthenopteron, what about the physical form? The actual inner ear bones? Eusthenopteron's stapes is nearly in place, and by the time we meet the primitive amphibian Tulerpeton, the first inner ear bone is in place and functional for terrestrial hearing and balance. 

The synapsids though, hold the key for the mallus and the incus. Through the following organisms (some species some genera) , we find the inner ear bones separating out from the ramus of the mandible and moving interior nearer to the stapes. **This is an evolutionary trend, meaning there aren't known synapsids, therapsids or cynodonts who violate this theme of separating and migrating ossicles ""primitive"" to the modern malus and incus.**

The author continues, addressing the idea of a partiathrinl tympanic membrane: "" ‘evolutionary optimization is not measured in absolute terms, but by its relation to contemporaneous and sympatric competitors, i.e. it must have been good enough for the Permian world’ (p. 316). Luo &amp; Crompton ([1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718169/#joa12379-bib-0057)) carefully analyzed the structural and functional transformation of the quadrate into an incus in advanced cynodonts. ""

[Thrinaxodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrinaxodon): The articular bone (malus) is in or almost in position, and is the appropriate size. And in addition, we see the development of some of the outer ear as well, the tympanic membrane now being located inside the skull. "" The otic region is defined by the regions surrounding the temporal fenestrae. Most notable is evidence of a deep recess that is just anterior to the fenestra ovalis, containing evidence of smooth muscle interactions with the skull. Such smooth muscle interactions have been interpreted to be indicative of the tympanum and give the implications that this recess, in conjunction with the fenestra ovalis, outline the origin of the ear in *Thrinaxodon*. This is a new synapomorphy as this physiology had arisen in *Thrinaxodon* and had been conserved through late Cynodontia."" 

Furthermore, more information can be gleaned in relation to the location of the tympanic membrane, including the nature of what would become the muscles which allows mammals to move their ears about: "" The remainder of this pit opens to an ""un-ossified"" region which comes somewhat close to the cochlear recess, giving one the assumption that inner ear articulation occurred directly within this region.""

**Key Information Regarding  Thrinaxodon**

Thrinaxodon's skull looks very much like a modern mammal, the Kangaroo Rat, in the middle of it's embryological development, only to finish up as an adult with a modern mammal inner ear. This of course supports the notion that some aspects of embryology mirror evovlutionary history (at least in utero or newborn in marsupials). Fascinatingly enough, in the link below the squamate Agama lizard, newborn and adult Kangaroo-rats and Thrinaxodon are compared.

**Stapes and Malus In Modern Position**

[Cynognathus:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynognathus) With two ear bones in place, we are now watching the incus, which is properly diminished but still migrating. Additionally, this animal's mandibular joints are evolving as well. Generally reptiles have two jaw joints while mammals have one one. Cynognathus has two joints, like reptiles, but one of these joints is [mammalian](https://lflank.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/written-in-bone-cynognathus/) in nature!

[Yanucodon:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanoconodon) We now have one mammalian jaw joint, a nearly in place [incus](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fossil-reveals-ear-evolution-in-action/) and an in-place malus and stapes.

**Stapes, Malus and Incus in Modern Position**

[Eomaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eomaia)/[Sinodelphys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinodelphys): True mammals from the Early-Mid Cretaceous. Inner ear is fully functional! The former, Eomaia, is a placental mammal while the latter, Sinodelphys, is a marsupial suggesting the inner ear developed prior to the placental/marsupial split!  

&amp;#x200B;

The picture can be painted clearly: the genetics for function and the paleontology for form are easily traced through history and present day. The two show our relationship to all other animals, from box jellies to ancient synapsids. 

The study of the inner ear is, in my opinion, one of the most fascinating examples of evolution and it is all encased in the sides of our skulls by three tiny bones.

Problem 1:
How do you deal with the fact that simpler life forms (singe cell organisms) have less genomic data (sometimes 1000 times more). How can the simple life form be added 1000 times more base pairs in their genome. The cells cant even handle that amount of data.

Problem 2:
How do you deal with the probablity of life forming from the buildingblocks (amino acids nukleaic acids)? The problability has to be calculated in a way which imply that you take into accound the left and right handed stereomere of the amino acids, only the left one used. Giving you 40 different variables to form lets say a 200 amino acid protein without taking into acount the degradation of amino acids and the chance of it folding correctly. The chance would be 1/ (40^200). Even when counting the reaction rate to be in the miliseconds and use the entire earth, where each molecule is an amino acids would still give you a number that is in the 10^180 or something. The only way this would work is if the timeline given (13,7 B years) is streatched to 10^150 years.",15,23,1553457782,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b50sjy/discussing_the_idea_of_single_cell_to_multiple/

DebateEvolution,b4thuk,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,"ICR and their Fraudulent ""Living Tissue"" List","So I saw some recent posts at creationevolution on living tissues and their support for a young earth. I am very familiar with Mary Schwietzer's work with the Tyrannosaur and Hadrosaur framboids, but had not been informed that there were some other ""live tissues"" being proposed, most specifically, same Late-Cambrian and Early-Ordovician species (namely, chitin)

Fortunately someone went to the trouble of dissecting this list of varying ""live tissues"" and posting a play-by-play of their opinion on each, along with links to the papers/abstracts so others can read for themselves. 

[EyeonICR's Labors](https://eyeonicr.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/they-have-a-list/)

ICR's list is included at the top. 

Notable examples with my own observations include:

**""Shrimp Shell and Muscle"" est 360 mya**

And directly in the linked abstract the nature of these preserved *muscle striations* are covered:

"" The shrimp specimen is remarkably preserved; it has been phosphatized, and the muscles of the pleon have been preserved completely enough that discrete muscle bands are discernable. The cuticle of the cephalothorax is shattered into small fragments, whereas that of the pleon is absent except for the telson. Confirmation that this specimen represents a Devonian decapod documents only the second decapod taxon known from the Devonian and the third from the Paleozoic. It is the earliest known shrimp and one of the two oldest decapods, both from North America. ""

So, not quite live tissue.

**""Chitin and Chitin-Associated Protiens"" est 417 mya**

Chitin is formed by polysacharides and is found in the cell walls of fungi and in the exoskeletons of arthropods. This is certainly not analogous to ""live tissue"" in the sense that ICR is attempting to portray. Furthermore, the abstract clears up precisely the nature of this find: 

""Modification of this complex is evident via changes in organic functional groups. Both fossil cuticles contain considerable aliphatic carbon relative to modern cuticle. However, the concentration of vestigial chitin-protein complex is high, 59% and 53% in the fossil scorpion and eurypterid, respectively. Preservation of a high-nitrogen-content chitin-protein residue in organic arthropod cuticle likely depends on condensation of cuticle-derived fatty acids onto a structurally modified chitin-protein molecular scaffold, thus preserving the remnant chitin-protein complex and cuticle from degradation by microorganisms.""

So, not quite live tissue.

and a personal favorite of mine:

**""C-14 Date of a Mosasaur: 24,600 Years""**

To my knowledge, you cannot date an organism older than 40-50,000 years with C-14 **period.** 

And if you could, and were trying to get a Young Earth date, 24,600 isn't helping you very much anyways.

Let me know your thoughts, as I know the author of the blog was unsure of a few of their conclusions. But I think they did a pretty swell job considering the material they had to wade through.

Is the Creationist answer that God decided to create a few squirrels in some corner of the forest? Would the answer be a Young Earth Creationist approach and say squirrels were created on the same day all the other animals were created?

I'm really curious as to how a Creationist would answer this question. It leads to some curious scientific questions. How often does a new species get created? How many of a species are 'created' without normal reproduction to allow for a viable species to take hold in an ecosystem?

I'm gonna grab a few of these that have been discussed at some length. Feel free to pick your favorite and go town.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of viruses. There was an excellent post about this recently. This shows the 7 genome types

Viruses aren't monophyletic, so it isn't as simple as figuring out ""the"" origin. [Some evolved from plasmids](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-112) (and we can see exactly [how this might occur in real time](http://www.virology.ws/2017/08/31/a-plasmid-on-the-road-to-becoming-a-virus/)), some [may have evolved from cellular life,](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/03/18/glimpses-of-the-fourth-domain/) or at least share a MRCA with cellular life. 

Have we figured them all out yet? No. ""Cannot"" be explained via evolution? Haha. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of tetrapods from fish. The structure of fish fins is nothing like a tetrapod limb. (See this for Tiktaalik limb)

Lobe-fins and modern tetrapod limbs [literally have the same major bones.](http://www.devoniantimes.org/opportunity/tetrapodsAnswer.html) The proportions are different, but aside from the most distal sets of bones, the major structures are all there and are developmentally and evolutionarily homologous. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of new organs like the eye. This might be solved by more research (doubtful), but right now the situation seems to be this: (i) line up all types of eyes from simplest to most complex, (ii) state that the simple ones evolved into complex ones. QED. (iii) Provide no details for which genes change, which new proteins need to arise and in which order this needs to happen. The amount of knowledge that is missing here is staggering.

We literally know the two major genes that needed to change in order for eyes to evolve, and exactly how they changed over time. The first group are [opsins,](http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2011-2012/m2o1112/web/file_opsin_evolution.html) which evolved from g-protein coupled receptors that became photosensitive. 

The second are crystallins, found in the lens, which evolved from heat-shock proteins. [Here's one example.](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31176) 

To say we don't know which genes changed or which new proteins arose, one must ignore mountains of work on the subject, and also not use Google. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;How the different plumbing of the various reptilian hearts could have evolved without killing the reptiles.

I think we talked about this [before.](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/65xmgz/evolution_of_the_human_heart/) 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Splicosomes. These are complicated intricate molecular machines made up of many parts. This is one of the many examples of irreducible complexity that evolution can't explain. What's the point of the splicosome if there are no introns to remove? But if the introns came first, with no splicosome, then it would be fatal to the cell. We have to have introns (with all of the signalling information as to where they start and end) and splicosomes appearing simultaneously.

[Did that one,](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/68pg99/creationist_claim_biologists_cant_explain_the/) too. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of new genes (?). I think that the only way that genes can occur in evolution is by gene duplication (since random changes are harmful).

&lt;Whispers&gt; Gene duplications *are* random changes. 

And also, most mutations are neutral, yes, that's a fact, and if you disagree, you better come with the data to back it up.

But like, of all the things on this list, new genes is maybe the easiest. Gene duplicates, one copy mutates, does a new thing. That's what happened with both opsins and crystallins above, for example. It's why we have two forms of hemoglobin, plus myoglobin. I thought this was supposed to be things evolutionion *cannot* explain. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, just wanted to cover some of the high notes there, since none of it is particularly new. 

I'll end with a question: Creationists, *how* does creation explain these features or systems? What's the *mechanism* through which they originate via creation? If we're going to hold evolution to that standard, the alternative will be held to the same standard.

DebateEvolution,b01xml,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Novel ""Irreducible"" Functionality in Lambda Phage WITHOUT Loss of Original Function","Lenski's having a back-and-forth with Behe about the latter's new cash cow, which I personally think is a waste of time since Behe has never seemed interested in anything like listening to critics...or learning...or not repeating the same tired crap virtually verbatim for coming up on three decades, but I digress.

Anyway, Lenski explains an experiment on a bacteriophage (Lambda phage) that demonstrates a clearcut case of 1) an ""irreducible"" biochemical trait evolving, and 2) a novel function evolving without the loss of the original function. 

My favorite example of such an evolutionary event is the evolution of tetherin antagonism in HIV-1 group M Vpu, but this will be number two on my list going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's Lenski's explanation,
](https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2019/03/06/evolution-goes-viral-and-how-real-science-works/) which I'll summarize.

The short (and somewhat simplified) version is that Lambda uses a specific protein on the surface of it's host to inject its DNA, and it's never, in decades and decades of watching it evolve in the lab, evolved to use a different protein. 

But [this experiment](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC3306806&amp;blobtype=pdf) (pdf) resulted in a strain that uses a different protein to inject its DNA. Once they isolated that strain, they replicated the conditions and found the same trait over and over. In every case, four mutations were required to use the alternate receptor (two of which were always the same, and two of which could vary slightly). Anything less and the trait did not appear. They actually generated triple mutants to check that all four mutations were needed and showed that three of the four were insufficient. 

By Behe's own definition, this is an irreducible trait. But the researchers watched it evolve, over and over, 25 times in total, always requiring four mutations. 

That is a direct refutation of Behe's original creationist argument, as articulated in ""Darwin's Black Box"". The next finding directly contradicts his argument in ""Darwin Devolves"".

&amp;nbsp;

This second finding is that these strains, exhibiting a novel trait, retained the ability to use the original receptor. In fact, some of the mutations required for the new function *also improved the old function*. This is a direct refutation of Behe's newish (ish because he's been making this argument for as long as I can remember, but new in that it's the topic of the latest book) argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

DebateEvolution,azpl4p,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The Karoo Formation and it's Implications for the Flood,"The Karoo Formation is a term used to describe a large portion (400,000 km) of South Africa and is generally characterized by it's arid semi-desert climate. This area is famous for it's impeccably rich fossil deposits, ranging from 310 mya to 80 mya, or approximately the Mid-Carboniferous to the Late Cretaceous. It's fossil record is most concentrated in the Permian and Triassic periods however, due to varying environmental factors. 

So why is this formation important? The Karoo formation was famously referenced by Whitcomb and Morris, the ancestors of all modern Flood Geologists, as being a dead ringer for a ""Fossil Graveyard"" created during the Great Biblical Flood. This is due to the estimated *800 billion fossils* thought to be present at the site. This number comes from the late  Robert E. Sloan, a Paleontologist who studied the formation under the University of Minnesota. 

The problem here is probably evident right off the bat. 800 billion organisms fossilized during the flood, as Whitcomb and Morris suggest, would be an impossible burden for an ecosystem; it is impossible. Dr.  Robert J. Schadewald did the math for us on this one: 

&amp;#x200B;

""A minute's work with a calculator shows that, if the *800 billion animals* in the Karoo formation could be resurrected, there would be *twenty-one of them for every acre of land on earth.* Suppose we assume (conservatively, I think) that the Karroo Formation contains *1 percent of the vertebrate \[land\] fossils on earth*. Then when the Flood began, there must have been at least **2100 living animals per acre, ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs.** To a noncreationist mind, that seems a bit crowded.""

&amp;#x200B;

So there appears to be a space problem. How do YEC's deal with this? I have seen a few different ways, so let's skim through them briefly. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The fossilized organisms didn't live there, they were simply buried there. (source: Various)

This is a problematic answer immediately, because even from a conventional standpoint in science we recognize there have been many large regional floods which have killed and fossilized a great deal of organisms (such as the [Washington Scablands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channeled_Scablands)). In these cases of massive flooding, or any event in which dead organisms are carried by water, we see massive jumbling events like those seen in [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument#The_Quarry). Essentially all the bones of all the carried dead vertebrates are brought together when the water calms (be it the subsidence of a flood or a bend in a river) where they decompose and their bones are fossilized in a large amalgamation of creatures. We DON'T see this at Karoo though, we see what we would expect from regular death events in a habitat conducive to fossilization. Taphonomy dictates it to be so.

* The unusually high density of animals per acre isn't a problem, we see it in ecosystems today! (source: [The Notorious A.I.G](https://answersingenesis.org/fossils/fossil-record/karoo-vertebrate-non-problem/))

If you check out the link (RIP your browser history) you should notice how defensive this article is. It is quick to point out that the 800 billion article is an estimate (and thus bad) but then state that even if it IS accurate, it's still not a problem because we see organism density at this level today. The admirable Dr. Woodmorappe (who, to his credit, admits bristlecone pines are problematic for YEC) notes 

""Simple studies of actual reptile population densities show that the requisite densities of reptiles not only are possible but do in fact exist even on today’s earth."" 

And proceeds to source his own paper on the subject, which is not readily available online to my knowledge (I couldn't find a pdf) The article does address the imminent criticism that you cannot apply small scale population density to a 400,000 square km area (implying whatever reptile population Woodmorappe references is indeed a small local one) but neglects to actually answer the question, invoking ""pre-flood world productivity maximums"". But given the Bible does not mention any pre-flood world ecology stats, this would qualify as ""Historical Science"" and is thus, invalid entirely. 

* Estimates are bad/The Estimate was a Lie (source: [Schadewald's conversation with the infamous Gish](https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer))

Estimates are only bad when they apply to evolutionary theory it seems. Apply them to other areas of science and it becomes a-okay. As for lying, Gish is certainly one to talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize: The Karoo formation holds far too many fossils of varying organisms to suggest they all lived at the same time in the same, let alone in a stable super-ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a closing remark, it should be noted that the Karoo formation lacks marine fossils, bringing into question the nature of a flood which could carry 800 billion organisms to a single spot, and not pick up a single trilobite along the way.

DebateEvolution,ayuvj4,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Radiometric Dating is Corroborated by Plate Tectonics (And thus proven accurate...yet again),"YEC's will often admit that radiometric dating can be accurate for a few thousand years, but tend to insist that it fails when applied to older rocks due to presuppositions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dates can only be reliable *if* 

* radioactive decay rates haven't changed
* the systems have remained closed
* the rocks were't overheated
* samples haven't been contaminated

&amp;#x200B;

And to them, that's a lot if ""ifs"". You can propose the fact that multiple dating methods agree, and they may respond that it is possible the decay rates have been slowing proportionally. You can propose coral reefs, dendochronology and ice cores, and they might wave these away as well with various statements on fast-growing reefs, double annual rings or corrupted ice samples. None of these excuses are valid, but anyone using these particular excuses won't care. 

So what other methods can we use to determine the accuracy of Radiometric dating? Well, for one there is an enormous heat problem when invoking faster decay: [A 70,000 C/km kind of problem actually](http://chem.tufts.edu/science/geology/adam-eve_toast.htm)

In conjunction with the [Oklo Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor) we know the rates have remained constant. 

But let's say for argument's sake that none of that is good enough either. This is when we can turn to Plate Tectonics. 

When we look at a map of the Atlantic seafloor, we can make out an enormous mountain ridge, the mid-Atlantic Ridge, which divides NA and SA from Europe and Africa. Magma wells up at this ridge, which is volcanic in nature, and adds new crust thus continuing the division of these continents and the expansion of the seafloor. 

Now, the ages of the rocks at the ocean crust tell a story. The closer to the ridge, the newer the igneous rock formed and thus the younger the rock. As we move outwards towards the continents on either side, the rocks get older with a maximum age of about 180 million years. 

We can measure the rate of separation of the continents by using the rock ages and the distance between the landmasses as well, yielding a rate of 1.2 in per year. Changing the location (perhaps we measure at varying longitudes) we get a range of 1.2 in to 1.7 in per year. 

**So how does this help us test Radiometric Dating?**

Satellite stations on each continent allow us to precisely measure distance movement, down to the scale of mere inches or less. Long-term measurement over the decades has given us a rate of movement around 1 inch per year, which is noticeably close to 1.2 inches per year: the rate determined by Radiometric Dating. 

Let's take a moment to think on these implications. Flood Geologists claim NA and Africa separated during Noah's Flood extremely rapidly, and that the rates have slowed to their current rate by some means. **For this to be the case, two entirely unrelated processes, plate movement and radioactive decay in isotopes, must have slowed down at precisely the same rate in order to give the** ***appearance*** **that the two corroborate one another.** 

Now from a science standpoint this is clear. But what about biblical? Can the literal reading of the bible justify God engaging in this kind of behavior? It would be very uncharacteristic. Romans 1:20 tells those who are religious that we can know God through Creation. If we can know Him through Creation, Creation is inherently not deceptive in nature. 

What this means, is that if nature says it is 4.8 billion years old, that it is in fact 4.8 billion years old. It also means that our fossils are old as well.",40,37,1552076716,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ayuvj4/radiometric_dating_is_corroborated_by_plate/
DebateEvolution,aytjae,witchdoc86,,t2_ccp95,self.DebateEvolution,,Haymond's Formation and Dougherty Gap - Evidence for an Old Earth (And Cognitive Dissonance in YECers),"I recently posted Glenn Morton's argument that Haymond's Formation, which has 15 000 alternating layers of shale (with burrows) and sand. As per Glenn Morton,

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  The sands have several characteristic sedimentary features which are found on turbidite deposits. Turbidites are deep water deposits in which each sand layer is deposited in a brief period of time, by a submarine ""landslide"" (I am trying to avoid jargon here) and the shale covering it is deposited over a long period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""long time"" for shale is demonstrable by the fact that the shale layers contain burrows. One can see the burrows here

[http://web.archive.org/web/20100614072622/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/haymond.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100614072622/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/haymond.htm)

As Glenn points out, these burrows are clear evidence for an old earth - 

\&gt;  For the non-geologist who is reading this this means that the burrows are in the shales (which take a long time to be deposited) so the animals would have lots of time to dig their burrows. The sandstones are the catastrophic deposit which covers and fills in the burrows with sand. The fact that there are no burrows in the sand proves that the sand was deposited rapidly.

\&gt; I pointed out that if the all the sedimentary record had to be deposited in a year long flood of Noah, then given that the entire geologic column in this area is 5000 meters thick, and that the Haymond beds are 1300 m thick, 1300/5000\*365 days = 95 days for the Haymond beds to be deposited. Since there are 15,000 of these layers, then 15,000/95 days = 157 layers per day need to be deposited. The problem is that the animals which made the burrows mentioned above, need some time to re-colonize and re-burrow the shale. Is it really reasonable to believe that 157 times per day or 6.5 times per hour, for all the burrowers to be buried, killed, and a new group colonize above them for the process to be repeated? Even allowing for a daily cycle, would require 41 years for this deposit to be laid down.

&amp;#x200B;

/u/kanbei85 thought ""there was something fishy"" -

\&gt;  That is extremely old! Anyway, I cannot make anything out of those grainy photos. I really can't comment, but something's fishy about the fact that this claim has been around since 2003 and nobody's talked about it in the literature. 

He later supplied me with something he thought might be somewhat related to Haymond's Formation - 

\&gt; Further reply:

\&gt; Upon further examination, there is this old article from CRSQ back in the 90's; it's a bit technical in the geology department so I am having to carefully read it to make it out, but it would seem to be at least somewhat related to the issue you've brought up.

The article he supplied me was 

[https://creationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/crsq-1996-volume-32-number-4.pdf](https://creationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/crsq-1996-volume-32-number-4.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

 Incredibly, in it, he has supplied me with a SECOND example of strong evidence against a Global Flood!!! At Dougherty Gap!

&amp;#x200B;

If one turns to pages 207-209, we again have alternating sandstone and bioturbinated shale layers;

Page 207 figure 9 - they argue that the sand layers are not bioturbated

&gt;Figure 9. A Photograph showing the ""assymetric linguoid ripples"" described by Sheehan (1988). If bioturbination of the sandstone did occur as proposed then most of if not all of these ripples should have been obliterated following the deposition of the sands.

They also argue that the shale is bioturbated -

&gt;The reader will note that the tops of the shale units are interpreted by Sheehan (1988) \[and we agree\] as being both bioturbinated and having erosional surface.

Yet these bioturbinated shale layers are alternating with sand layers they argue are not!

These are over 40 layers of each.

Much thanks [/u/kanbei85](https://www.reddit.com/u/kanbei85)

Sandstone layer. Bioturbinated shale layer. Sandstone layer. Bioturbinated shale layer.

If you read the article further, they disagree with Sheehan (1988) about its age (because millions of years does not fit a young earth model) - and propose (because the Bible said so) it was all formed in less than a year from a catastrophic flood...

Page 209 details further how burrows were found not in the sand, but in the shale layers.

\&gt;   We never observed, nor did Sheehan document, the occurrence of lined burrows within any of the sandstone units. 

It also documents 

\&gt;  We view the sandstone sole casts as trace fossil structures which resulted due to scour-and-fill turbidite deposition associated with pre-event trace fossil associations (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6b). These sole casts were originally tracks and burrows made in the clay substrate (not sand as Sheehan has reported) which were partially eroded and filled with sand, thus forming sandstone sole casts 

Well. I am not a geologist/palaeontologist.

But - in a catastrophic flood model, how do alternating sand and bioturbinate shale (which has burrows) occur?

/u/kanbei85 has been so blinded, he argues

\&gt; The whole idea of strata being the result of millions of years of slow deposition has been debunked entirely by experimental science. You can watch layers form in real time as a result of mechanical sorting of particles by size, density, shape, etc. So whatever the nature of these so-called 'burrows', and whatever their cause, that does not by any means change the fact that we **know** that strata are formed by fast-moving (catastrophic) forces, not slow and gradual ones.

The piece he linked was from ICR, not the original paper though. Here I have linked the original, as I feel it contains much more information and does so as the researchers intended. I'm also not a fan of ICR, which likely comes as no surprise to anyone. 

 To summarize the pollen findings as I have interpreted them (from a comment I posted over there):

The pollen found in this Triassic period is not the same pollen as the kind we see from ""True'' Angiosperms. In the first article on this very topic we see the reference to these pollen-progenators as [primitive](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131001191811.htm) in nature. Is this not what we should expect from Evolutionary Theory? That complex angiospems must have a progenitor that was itself, a precursor? [This paleontology blog](http://paleoplant.blogspot.com/2013/10/fossil-pollen-place-angiosperms-in.html) further explores the nature of these primitive granules and compares them to modern ones, as well as the history if gymnosperm and angiosperm evolution.

In short, this seems to be science behaving as it should. It should also be noted that the dated of things seem to change almost exclusively in the ""older"" direction. This means we should be finding even *more* pollen that previously posited in flood rock. It also doesn't change my previous post: there is still no pollen in the Grand Canyon, because it is mid-Permian and before, as evolutionary theory states.

So, I retract my previous statement that pollen is found in only the Cretaceous, as we now know that angiosperms began development in the Triassic. It is of no consequence to my notions on the Grand Canyon however.",31,17,1551821738,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/axqk2u/my_mistake_pollen_has_been_found_in_the_triassic/

Much of my information was gleaned from ""Grand Canyon: Monument to an Ancient Earth"" which is a sort of case study on geology and paleontology in the Grand Canyon. It's a book written by both Theistic Evolutionists and purely secular scientists, and contains some absolutely killer diagrams and photographs to illustrate their point. I recommend it highly to anyone even slightly interested in geology and GC paleontology. 

Much of my discussion surrounds supporting Evolutionary Theory and rejecting a Global Flood simultaneously. 

So my paleontologic evidence. 

* Fossil organisation

Fossils are organized according to evolutionary theory in regards to complexity. The typical riot with this point boils down to pointing out various layers *never* hold organisms that would not have existed during that time, but should, if we are considering a global flood depositing these many layers. 

The Tonto formation of the Grand Canyon for example, contains over 47 species of trilobite, but not a single jawless fish. Similarly, there aren't any fossils of anything existing outside the Paleozoic in the Grand Canyon: period. 

But more importantly are the fossils of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. This is a basement layer of the Grand Canyon, and it considered pre-flood rock. And yet it is covered in stromatolite fossils. This rock is usually posited as pre-flood rock because it cannot form rapidly. Ever. Most YEC's will admit this, and relegate it to rock having been created as-is, ex nihilo. However, this rock with dead organisms in it, exists as a part of the perfect creation pre-fall and pre-flood? 

In evolutionary theory this is what is to be expected. Archean fossils occur in ancient archean rock. Similar to the cyanobacterial fossils found in superdeep boreholes, the deeper we go the less complex we tend to get.

* The Freshwater Fish Problem

We find lakes which are posited as ""post flood"" in nature with freshwater fish fossils in them. Most freshwater fish die within minutes of being submerged in saltwater. If we are working from a flood angle, there should be no freshwater fish at all today or a hyper-evolution can be invoked. 

According to Evolutionary Theory these areas should contain freshwater fish similar to the ones we see today in overall composition, but not the precise species. This is what we find. Never has an identical organism been found in ancient rock. Even the Devonian coelacanth was a different species from the ones we have today.

* The Pollen Problem

Angiosperms cam around during the Cretaceous in the evolutionary timeline. As such, most fossil-rich rock contains microfossils of pollen, so long as it is post Cretaceous. However, as previously mentioned the Grand Canyon is only Paleozoic (it ends mid-Permian I believe) so we should not expect to find pollen. And we don't. In the event of a global flood, pollen would be easily found in fossil layers *everywhere* given all angiosperms would be submerged. These particles would mix with the sediment and be in nearly every layer. But we only find it with Cretaceous and above, according to Evolutionary Theory. 

Additionally, to confirm our hypothesis further, we should only find pollinating insects and animals in layers of the Cretaceous and above. Disprove this by providing a bee or hummingbird from the Carboniferous. 

* The Corals and the Crinoids

Enormous coral bed fossils exist in the Grand Canyon. Primitive species in low levels and more modern species high up. These species belong to BOTH the fast and slow growing species, meaning the slow-growers require thousands upon thousands of years to reach their size at fossilization. 

Crinoids are frond-like marine mammals and are very fragile. In many places in the western states of the USA, nearly pure layers of crinoid fossils exist up to 500 feet thick. These crinoids are primitive in nature and occur in the Redwall limestone of the Grand canyon. To explain these ridiculously thick layers of slow-growing colony animals (thickness is gained through succession, similar to modern reefs) Flood Geology must invoke the idea of multiple colonies of crinoids being washed together into a single location and fossilized. Did I emphasize how fragile these animals are? Or how many of these layers contain thousands of intact crinoids?

* Footprints in Flood layers

Foodprints matching tetrapod locomotion have been found in Coconino, Supai and Hermit groups. These are separate layers on top of one another, and the prints do not indicate any sort of escape-hypothesis. Even if they did, these gentle tracks are preserved in three successive layers which were deposited LATE in the flood. So somehow, tetrapods survived to the end of the flood in the water, and then in three separate layers gently strolled along the depositing sediment only to be killed, buried with their tracks, and for the subsequent tetrapod to do the same in the next layer all while a catastrophic flood is depositing layers which should take millions of years to form?

In Evolutionary theory this is because these areas were arid at the time the tracks were made by these potentially reptilian tetrapods and due to the slow locomotion (close together prints) and dragging tail, they were likely in no hurry.

* Fossil articulation

Fossils found in enormous floods end up dis-articulated and jumbled together with other animals killed in the event. Yet the majority of fossils we find globally are shown to have been killed and buried by more instantaneous processes such as mudslides, volcanism, bog/tar traps and other quick deposition activity such as more minor local floods. Known large flooding events leave organisms torn apart and scattered amongst a collage of other unlucky victims. 

From an evolutionary perspective, taphonomy dictates a tendency of quick burial and slow mineralization. 

* DNA viability

DNA samples are more viable in more recently deceased specimens. This is why we have Neanderthal and Mastadon DNA, and none from any eusthenopterons. Before you quote Mary Schwietzer's T. Rex and Hadrosaur, remember that if the world is 6000 years old these animals should have GOBS of genetic material in them, not some framboids.

DebateEvolution,ax8xpu,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"Let's have a lesson on transmissible cancers and how they behave as evolutionary theory predicts, shall we?","Transmissible cancers are a thing. Not cancers that are caused by a virus, but actual transmissible cancers, where the cancer cells themselves transmit horizontally between individuals. There are only a few known examples: Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) in dogs, devil face tumor disease (DFTD) in Tasmanian devils, one in rodents (gerbils, maybe?) and I think one in molluscs, and that's it. 

&amp;nbsp;

The evolutionary dynamics of cancers are funky. Basically, as a multicellular organism, all of your cells are working together, but also competing with each other for space and resources. Genotypes that promote cancer are selected *for* in the context of this population of cells since they provide a competitive advantage - more bloodflow, faster growth, etc. In effect, the cancer acts as a parasite, with one important distinction: The vast majority of the time, cancers cannot transmit to a new host. 

This means their evolution is driven by intrahost competition, i.e. competition with the other cells of the body. This is directional selection for more and more ""aggressive"" cancer phenotypes, which is how cancer usually plays out. Importantly, this is an evolutionary dead end; the host dies, and that's the end of the line for the cancer. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you add in transmission to other host, we would predict different dynamics. Transmission introduces a different and often antagonistic selective pressure, *inter*host competition. This is competition between the cancer cells in a single individuals and the cells *of other individuals*. This is a tradeoff that all parasites, from viruses to tapeworms, have to balance. Get ""too good"" at intrahost competition, and you kill your host without transmitting. Go to far the other way and you readily transmit, but your host's immune system defeats you. 

We see the solution in parasites: Host morbidity (i.e. parasites harm the host...), but not host *mortality* (...but do not kill the host). This is what we expect to see when cancers become transmissible. 

Does that prediction hold?

&amp;nbsp;

CTVT is old. It's been around since before the dog/wolf divergence. So it has been subject to these antagonistic selective pressures for upwards of ten thousand years. And...it's temporary and nonfatal. The tumors grow, and then go away, possibly transmitting in between. 

DFTD is recent. It first appeared, IIRC, in the 90s. And it had a 100% mortality rate, since the interhost competition hadn't really driven its evolution. For a while, it looked like it might drive Tasmanian devils to extinction. 

But now, there are a handful of populations that are resistant to DFTD. The tumors grow, then go away. There are probably a few different aspects to this: The Tasmanian devils themselves are adapting to the cancer, but the cancer is also probably adapting to transmitting, rather than operating as a dead end. 

This is *exactly* as predicted: Interhost competition introduces selection for lower virulence, which means the disease becomes non-fatal. 

&amp;nbsp;

Given how evolutionary theory proposes that populations should change over time, we can make specific predictions about, given a specific change in a population, how its evolutionary trajectory will change. Transmissible cancers provide a ""natural experiment"" to evaluate the veracity of these predictions (and therefore the underlying theory, and the results are *exactly* what we would expect if evolution works the way we think it does.

I tend to use AiG as a framework for how I discuss and debate with Creationists, as my IRL YEC friend reads it as gospel. I say this so as to let those reading know where my YEC presuppositions come from. I am not trying to create a strawman, as I have been so often accused, but to open a discussion on my personal specialty: hominids. 

Anyways, AiG sees humans as wholly unique from animals, something I covered in a previous thread as taxonomically untrue. This organisation relegates the hominids in odd ways, lumping them in somewhat indistinguishable ways. For instance, they claim *H. neanderthalensis* was human. Not a human *kind*, but actually human. I have a different opinion, clearly. 

But the topic is on the middle-way hominids. These organisms are all ""Muddles-In-The-Middle"" even to professional Anthropologists, particularly *H. habilis.* Should it be an australopithicine? I'll leave it to you guys. 

So the question again: **What ""kind"" are these hominids from a Creationist perspective? Human or Ape?** 

And if you are feeling generous, an explanation why would be nice. This is meant to be a discussion though, so I do plan on replying.

So the hominids, in order of appearance:

***Homo habilis*****:** 2.4-1.6 mya

Brain case: 550-700 cm SQ and 3-4 ft

Known from: several nearly complete skulls, some post crania

[Homo habilis](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-habilis) is the first animal classified as genus Homo, rather than an australopithicine. It has reduced prognathism, smaller canines and a smaller brow ridge. It's small, like it's predecessors, but it's body ratio is trending towards human, although the arms are still ""too long"". It was certainly obligately bipedal, due to it's knees and ventral foremen magnum. H. habilis is found frequently with stone tools.

***Homo rudolfensis***: 1.9-1.8 mya

Brain case: 775 cm SQ and 3-4 ft

Known from: a single skull and some post crania indicating it is apart from H. habilis

[Homo rudolfensis](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-rudolfensis) is considered unique from H. habilis, but only recently so. It has unique features not within species variety in the constraints of natural selection: ""larger braincase, longer face, and larger molar and premolar teeth. Due to the last two features, though, some scientists still wonder whether this species might better be considered an *Australopithecus*, although one with a large brain!"" If H. rudolfensis is a transitioning form of H habilis, it likely used tools as well although to my knowledge no direct tools have been found with it.

***Homo georgicus***: 1.7 mya

Brain case: 600 cm SQ and 3.5-5 ft

Known from: Four fossil skeletons and many partials

[Homo georgicus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) is somewhat controversial in it's ranking. It has a small braincase size for Homo and more ""old traits"": showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between [*Australopithecus*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus) and *Homo erectus*, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Tool use is observed both in finding tools with the specimens and cuts in animals bones found alongside specimens.

***Homo eragaster*** 1.9-1.5 mya

Brain case: 600-910 cm SQ and 4-5 feet

Known from: One nearly complete skeleton, some complete skulls and some post crania

[Homo ergaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster) also is controversial in it's ranking. It's high cranial diversity and occipital traits make it likely that H. eragaster is either a late transition of Homo erectus or is actually early representations of H. erectus itself. However,  *H. ergaster* may be distinguished from *H. erectus* by its thinner skull-bones and lack of an obvious supraorbital foremen, and from *H. heidelbergensis* by its thinner bones, more protrusive face, and lower forehead. Tool use, just as the previous.

***Homo erectus*** 1.8 mya-145,000 (some suggest even 30,000)

Brain case: 900-1000 cm SQ and 4-6 feet

Known from: Dozens of fossils varying from nearly complete skeletons to individual skulls and post crania

[Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) is one of the best represented fossils in many regards. It can b difficult to pinpoint exactly how many due to it's many subspecies and reputation as a highly variable species. It sports unique teeth from modern humans, as well as many cranial features (such as zygomatics). It's brain case is far smaller than even our smallest range for a normal phenotype, and yet, H. erectus settlements show fire use and more sophisticated tools than it's predecessors. This animal is found nearly all over, from Africa to Europe to Asia. It is likely it proliferated into the H. neanderthalensis (we have genetic hybrid bones) Denisovans and H. floresiensis. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think? For the record, I will include Homo sapiens for comparison: 

***Homo sapiens***: 300,000-present

Brain case: 1200-1350 cm SQ, 4-6 ft

Known from: extreme proliferation everywhere

Homo sapiens is known to have several traits which place it in genus homo, and a few which make it unique from the others also in it. Tall, lanky posture with enormous brains (focused on the frontal lobe) and advanced tool use. Anatomically modern humans can be classified by lighter build skeletons than their predecessors. Skull is thin-walled and high-vaulted with flat, near vertical foreheads. Reduced prognathism and brow ridges as well, small mandibles and teeth comparatively. Narrow hips support the most efficient biped hominid of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, all the hominids in this list are bipedal, used tools and are classified in the genus ""Homo"".",22,36,1551596947,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/awrocy/open_challenge_to_creationists_what_kind_are/
DebateEvolution,awjcqy,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Could you answer The Vise Strategy?,"In 2005, William Dembski released The Vice Strategy document. The intent was to subpoena evolution promoting scientists, and to interrogate them about evolution and intelligent design.

As part of that document, there is a long list of questions that Dembski suggests the interrogator ask the evolutionist. These are presented in sequence, as a suggested interrogation procedure, which Dembski believes will force the evolutionist to admit that intelligent design is science.

This is the link to the document, the questions start on page 4:

https://billdembski.com/documents/2005.11.Vise_Strategy.pdf

When I said it was a long list, I wasn't kidding. Rather than write up a response to 9 pages of questions (and expect anyone but myself to read it!) I thought you guys might have fun picking it apart. Pick a question, or a series of questions, and show your answers. How would you respond if you were subject to this interrogation?

I'll start with a few:

&gt; Could you explain the scientific status of methodological materialism? For instance, you stated
that testability is a criterion for true science. Is there any scientific experiment that tests
methodological materialism? Can you describe such an experiment?

Methodological naturalism isn't a scientific theory, in the same way as evolution or gravity. As the name suggests, it's a method of science. It's a very simple one too. It is the reasonable conclusion of a single prediction: That everything we find will be natural, and that one prediction is repeatedly fulfilled with every discovery. It is a tentative conclusion, that would be proven invalid the moment an actual supernatural discovery is made. But even those who profess to believe in the supernatural aren't surprised when such a discovery is never made.

So to reiterate, there's no single experiment that can test for MN. Rather, it's a broad assessment of all discoveries, and what you should reasonably expect of further discoveries.

&gt; Are there theoretical reasons from science for accepting methodological materialism? For
instance, we know on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics that the search for
perpetual motion machines cannot succeed. Are there any theoretical reasons for thinking
that scientific inquiries that veer outside the strictures of methodological materialism
cannot succeed? Can you think of any such reasons?

No, there's nothing we know that makes the supernatural impossible. But nor is there anything we know of that makes the supernatural possible.

&gt; A compelling reason for holding to methodological materialism would be if it could be
demonstrated conclusively that all natural phenomena invariably submit to materialistic
explanations. Is there any such demonstration? 

Obviously not, but as I said before that's not the purpose of MN.

&gt; [Suppose here the success of evolutionary theory is invoked to justify methodological
materialism -- i.e., so many natural phenomena have submitted successfully to
materialistic explanation that it constitutes a good rule of thumb/working hypothesis. In
that case we ask:]

&gt; But wouldn’t you agree that there are many natural phenomena for which we haven’t a clue how
they can be accounted for in terms of materialistic explanation? Take the origin of life?
Isn’t the origin of life a wide open problem for biology, one which gives no indication of
submitting to materialistic explanation. 

Absolutely. But as MN states, every time in history, when we have not known something, and then we discovered the answer, the answer has always been natural. Because of that, it's reasonable to assume that the same is true of any of today's unknowns, including the origin of life.

(I'm skipping the next one because it depends on me answering ""no"" to the above.)

&gt; Would you agree, then, that methodological materialism is not scientifically testable, that there is
no way to confirm it scientifically, and therefore that it is not a scientific claim? Oh, you
think it can be confirmed scientifically? Please explain exactly how is it confirmed
scientifically? I’m sorry, but pointing to the success of materialistic explanations in
science won’t work here because the issue with materialistic explanations is not their
success in certain cases but with its success across the board. Is there any way to show
scientifically that materialistic explanations provide a true account for all natural
phenomena? Is it possible that the best materialistic explanation of a natural phenomenon
is not the true explanation? If this is not possible, please explain why not. [Keep
hammering away at these questions until you get a full concession that methodological
naturalism is not testable and cannot be confirmed scientifically.] 

You don't confirm or test MN by proving that it is right, and that's not MN's intent. Indeed, disproving the existence of the supernatural is disproving something unfalsifiable; logically impossible. MN is a method, and you confirm or test a method by looking at its reliability. And so far, MN has shown to be reliable.

&gt; Since methodological materialism is not a scientific claim, what is its force as a rule for science?
Why should scientists adopt it? [The usual answer here is “the success of science.”]

Because it's always been successful.

&gt; But if methodological materialism’s authority as a rule for science derives from its success in
guiding scientific inquiry, wouldn’t it be safe to say that it is merely a working hypothesis
for science? And as a working hypothesis, aren’t scientists free to discard it when they
find that it “no longer works”?

Absolutely. If we ever discovered something supernatural, then MN could be rationally disregarded.

&gt; It’s sometimes claimed that the majority of scientists have adopted methodological materialism
as a working hypothesis. But have all scientists adopted it? Is science governed by
majority rule?

Obviously not all scientists have adopted it, else we wouldn't be here. No, science isn't governed by majority rule.

&gt; If [as the witness will by now hopefully have admitted] methodological materialism is not a
scientific claim, how can it be unscientific for ID theorists to discard it as a working
hypothesis for science? In the absence of methodological materialism as a regulative
principle for science, what else is there that might prevent ID from being developed into a
full-fledged science? You claimed earlier that ID is not testable. Is that the reason you
think ID cannot be developed into a full-fledged science? 

In the case of ID and creationism, you can't just discard MN because you want the supernatural to exist, and expect to be taken seriously as a science. So much of ID is looking at things we don't know, in areas of science that aren't well understood, and filling the blanks with God. Why do you think they don't stick to things we do know about? They used to. They used to be all about bacterial flagellums, eyes, transitional fossils. But now it's all gene sequences, molecular biology, and maths on genetics. They stopped asking about things we know a lot about because when we know a lot about something, we know it doesn't work for creationism.",7,3,1551543901,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/awjcqy/could_you_answer_the_vise_strategy/

DebateEvolution,aw8d7a,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,The Wedge Document.,"I recently picked up a copy of the ‘Skeptics Guide to the Universe’ by Steven Novella et al.  I’d highly recommend the book to everyone here. While I’ve yet to finish the book, it’s a great primer on logical thinking and pseudoscience vs science.

Novella brought the ‘[Wedge Document]( https://ncse.com/creationism/general/wedge-document)’ to my attention. For the few of you here who don’t know (I hope I’m not the only one late to this party) the Wedge Document is a 1998 document produced by Steve Meyer’s Center for Science and Culture (Discovery Institute) or DI for short.  

The document is very clear in it’s goals:


Goal #1: To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies.


Goal #2: To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.

I’m sure some of you are wondering what the destructive moral, cultural and political legacies of scientific materialism are.


According to the document:

&gt;Materialists denied the existence of objective moral standards, claiming that environment dictates our behavior and beliefs… Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment… Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.

While the above is extremely fallacious, that’s out of the scope of ‘debate evolution’, or as /u/ DarwinZDF42 suggested ‘[Refute creationism for lurkers]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/av7f5w/since_nobody_actually_refutes_evolution_shouldnt/ehd9b92/)’.


According to Meyer, the DI should:

&gt; strive to overthrow… …materialism and its cultural legacies.  

How should the DI achieve it’s goals? 

&gt;‘By using [creationism] … … to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview.’


Creationists are attacking science in an orchestrated manner. I have no doubt that some members of the creationist movement are [useful idiots]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot), so we should strive to show creationists respect, and continue to attempt to educate those who have not demonstrated willful ignorance. However we should not bend; educate those who are here to learn, and fight pseudoscience with all your might. Make no mistake, creationism is 100% pseudoscience. Treat it as such.

In the unlikely event that the above failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that creationism is pseudoscience, we need look no further than /u/Kanbei85 post ‘[The Bible provides the foundation for all sound reasoning, morality, and the platform from which we can expect to do successful science to begin with.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/avq9ck/how_prevalentvocal_are_creationists_in_your/ehirwd4/). The demarcation problem can be a blurry line, but starting an examination into the nature of reality with a conclusion distills that blurry line into an electric fence and creationism is not only on the wrong side of the fence, it is pissing on the fence in an attempt to short it out.

We owe a great deal to past, present and future scientists for laying the groundwork for our incredible quality of life. I think there is an argument that the ‘worst off’ person reading this has a better quality of life than the most wealthy did only a few generation ago.  My own mother grew up w/o running water, and she’s in her early 60s. These attacks on science and a secular world view may be driven by a fallacious understanding of the mortality of heathens, but it will ultimately result in a worse quality of life for future generations if successful.  
 

As an aside, regulars might recognize my flair, for various reasons I’ve decided to retire my old account and start anew.  My personal goal is substantially cut down on ‘internet time’ (and as a result this sub). Without diving too deep into why, I’ve failed to adjust to new realities in my life and I don’t want to wake up in 10 years and realize I’ve squandered moments I can’t relive. I’ll still check in from time to time (especially when I’m stuck at the damn rig). Hopefully my post quantity will decrease, and the quality will increase.

Keep up the good fight, and remember, if you want to disprove a theory, you must replace it with a better one, not simply discount the old one. I’ve yet to see a single creationist submit a falsifiable hypothesis that can outperform the accepted theory in both explaining observations and making accurate predictions.  
All the best

[Original thread here.
](https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/atcx8l/researchers_watched_in_real_time_as_a/)

[Creationist response.](http://blog.drwile.com/no-these-researchers-did-not-see-a-single-celled-organism-evolve-into-a-multicellular-organism/?fbclid=IwAR0zoWfFnQJW7zVBFzqj55-w7QX8s1WIuGIxNYSGrNu6C151FbFB0t0t6tM)

[r/creation thread on response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/avxgk8/no_these_researchers_did_not_see_a_singlecelled/) 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the relevant part of the purported refutation:

&gt;The study examined the behavior of a green algae in the species charmingly named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the wild, these algae exist as individual, single-celled organisms. In the lab, the researchers exposed some of them to a natural predator (Paramecium tetraurelia) and found that the algae would come together and form colonies, since that made them less likely to be eaten by the predator. In other words, several individual single-celled organisms would “team up” to gain protection from the predator.

Nope. That's not what happened. From the original paper linked above:

&gt;Some strains, notably those from population B2, appeared to form amorphous clusters of variable cell number (Fig. 1A). Other strains, notably those from population B5, commonly formed stereotypic eight-celled clusters, with an apparent unicellular and tetrad life stage (Fig. 1B). Other phenotypic differences could be easily discerned by light microscopy. For example, in Fig. 1, an external membrane is visible around both evolved multicellular colonies, **indicating that they formed clonally via repeated cell division within the cluster, rather than via aggregation.**

Emphasis mine. ""Formed clonally"" means ""from a single cell dividing"", which is different from ""teaming up"". 

From later in the paper:

&gt;Conversely, three of the strains isolated from population B2 exist in cell clusters **comprised only of direct descendants, as opposed to chimeric aggregations with free-swimming cells.** Clusters from strains B2-11, B2-03, and B2-04 grow in tightly associated groups **of direct descendants embedded in the maternal cell wall** (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Videos 7, 8 and 9, respectively). Development in these isolates is therefore strictly clonal, with important implications for evolvability.

I mean, they specifically say ""it's via cell division, not aggregation"", and there are *videos* of this process. It's kind of hard to make this mistake. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dr. Wile, the creationist who authored this ""rebuttal"", doubles down on this error:

&gt;Here is where the new study is different. When they removed the predator, the cells stayed together. They even reproduced together. Indeed, the researchers report that even though the predator was removed four years ago, the cells have stayed in groups and reproduced in groups. As a result, they say they have produced an obligate multicellular form of the organism: one that stays together even when it could split into individual cells again.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Let’s say that even in the wild, this group of algae stays a group and is therefore truly an obligate multicellular form of the algae. Does this tell us anything about the origin of multicellularity? No. **All it shows is that single-celled organisms which already tend to clump together in groups when the need arises will sometimes stay in groups, even when the initial reason for the formation of the group is gone.**

Emphasis mine again. *This is not what the study showed*. The entire argument is built on that error. The structures in question did not form via aggregation. They grew clonally from a single founding cell. Therefore not only does the ""refutation"" fail to call the findings into question; it doesn't even discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

The exchange went like this. u/witchdoc86 was making  a point on the broken GULO gene (a gene which, when functioning properly, helps an organism synthesize Vitamin C) in primates (haplorhines and up I believe). This is indicative of common descent, at *least* of all primates (including humans) from a common ancestor who propagated a broken GULO gene. Witchdoc86 pointed out that the alternative is that in each primate species in haplorhini independently had their GULO gene broken in the same place in some sort of mass degeneration attempt. 

This is something that even Creationist site [Evolutionnews.com](https://Evolutionnews.com) can [admit](https://evolutionnews.org/2012/02/gulo_shared_mut/): "" The hypothesis of limited common descent seems to me, for the time being, a reasonable one. Perhaps it is the case that all taxa belonging to the Primate Order are related by descent."" Although they still do reject common ancestry as a whole, lest someone accuse me of quote mining.

u/mike_enders responded to this comment with some thoughts  

*"" Now this makes some sense. If it holds up (dubious at best) that its junk DNA then you will have a point. Your argument is essentially we have this similarity and it stretches belief that this similarity just occurs for any other reason but descent.*

*But Look at you with your bad self :) - I can tell by the way you write you think this is a KILLER proof of evolution based on the improbability of getting this molecular similarity. No rational human being who loves science can ever deny that this is just not likely to occur for no good reason and common descent must be it because these are closely related species in your theory. I mean how dumb can creationist get in their bone headed commitment to religion and deny this is the best fit?*

*Those stupid creationists can't seriously try to float that this molecular similarity just happened to CONVERGE within humans and apes.*

*Now of course now that you have seen me capitalize converge you might want to start back pedaling with your probability argument because like the wild dog about to take a piece out of the mail man - its about to bite you in the rear end.*

*Its cherry picking because when you see a molecular similarity you can't see anything but a direct proof of your thesis but when a creationist uses the EXACT same rationality and logic for molecular convergence - AGAIN the EXACT same improbabilty argument your side says its not a valid argument - its an argument from incredulity.*

*In molecular convergence you are looking at the same DNA and seeing a similarity nearly exact to what youa e referring to - that CANNOT exist because of close inheritance relationship and yet if you are like mos darwinists you will deny the same logic you just finished arguing for and start to do back strokes because if you don't its a STRONG evidence* ***against*** *evolution.*

*and that doesn't fit your bias and the kicker?*

*the ""broken"" genes you allude occur in hot spots so there is some basis for saying things can get broken in similar ways but you have ZERO explanation for how the mutations of molecular convergence appear for two unrelated species (natural selection only preserves sequences not cause them) and if a creationist makes the same argument you are making for GULO,the same logic is then labelled as an ""argument from incredulity"".*

Now, Mike has banned me but hopefully someone can get this to them: this is a false equivalence for many reasons, making this comment's thesis incorrect.

[Convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#At_molecular_level) is perhaps not what they think it is. "" The independent [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates **analogous structures** that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Point being, we don't tend to see identical molecular structures (such as complex metabolic pathways) evolve independently in two separate organisms that aren't related. We may see incredibly similar ones. Genetically, this implication is true: both fruit bats AND primates have lost the ability to synthesize Vitamin C, but not in identical places or in identical ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

The difference is Mike is suggesting that convergent evolution is like lightning striking the same place twice in every thunderstorm in say, Tulsa, for a year. When the reality is perhaps that once a year, lightning will strike within 50 feet of another preceding strike in the same storm. I know the reality of lightning strikes is probably very different but I'm not a meteorologist. 

&amp;#x200B;

**However.** The scenario Mike attempts to compare as equivalent, that all haplorhine primates happened to break the same GULO gene in the same location independently as a part of some kind of ""Coincidental Degradation"" is truly akin to winning the lottery over one hundred times...*playing the exact same number each time.* 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's just for one mutation in one family, let along all the mutations in all the taxa AND their ERV's. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this wasn't inappropriate, while I am not on excellent terms with Mike my intent is more to clear things up so those stumbling across that thread don't take it as a viable comparison rather than make a ""callout"". Although I suppose that's still inadvertently what this is. If this breaks any rules feel free to take it down.

Our [vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145266/) gene is broken in the exact same place, across all of the haplorhines as well, a coincidence that cannot be reasonably explained outside common ancestry. And among the primates, including humans, our [ERV's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2001186/) match us up as well.

The underlying point for genetics is: Humans have direct relation to the other great apes, lesser apes, old and new world monkeys, tarsiers, lorises and lemurs respectively than ANY other animal group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Physiologically, we compare to chimpanzees and bonobos most closely as well. Their skeleton mostly closely resembles ours among living organisms, and they thrive with their habitual bipedality. Together we sport grasping hands, binocular vision, an identical dental formula (2123), low but present sexual dimorphism, altricial young with large braincases, similar gestational/rearing periods and flatter faces in comparison to the other mammals. Our young are born with the grasping reflex for holding mother's fur, and we still retain this today. We are covered with close to the same number of hair follicles, but our fur/hair is much thinner than theirs. Both of us share an omnivorous diet primarily plant based (with the advent of cereals for modern humans) but take meat at every opportunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

And behaviorally the chimps and the bonobos occupy our own extremes: the warlike, patriarchal common chimps (pan troglodytes) versus the sexual, matricarchal bonobos (pan paniscus). They, like us, use tools and thrive in fission/fusion social groups. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is no other group to place humans cladistically, nor would any sane taxonomist do so. We are share more with the apes in our family than some canids do with the dogs in their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I maintain there is NO excuse for attempting to give humans their own ""Kind"" even from a YEC perspective, if one is arguing for scientific validity. If you wish to claim it is so because God made humans unique, this is fine, but you cannot make an honest argument from a biologic perspective. Humans may differ in our spirituality, culture or success, but this is of no consequence to my claim: the anatomy speaks for itself.",26,19,1551292811,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/avgs1x/humans_are_hominids_as_are_the_great_apes_and/

The only thing that seems to be a problem for them is a set of created kinds with humans being their own kind of life superior to everything else isn't supported by any field of actual science, nor is the global flood for that matter.

The rest of the creationist argument seems to be about misunderstanding reality, misrepresenting biology, or failing to comprehend deep time. They want to be special creations so they'll come up with anything, even cherry picking quotes, to attempt to hold onto the illusion of intellectual superiority. However, when it comes to what evolution is or what it entails they either accept it outright or try to impose barriers that don't actually exist. If anyone can do better at supporting creationism than this perhaps we might actually have something to debate, but as I see it there are two types of people: the ones who accept evolution and the ones who don't understand it. We can fix that through education better than we can by pretending that there are multiple plausible possibilities behind biological diversity and the genetic and morphological similarities that are quite evident.

Mike, as I'm sure you're aware, once we get back to ~2.1 billion years ago, the geological record is getting pretty damn spotty. The fact that we're only finding these rocks no in no way damage the theory of evolution.

DebateEvolution,apz0bh,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"An Evolutionary Biology Student Dissects Chapter 7 of Jeanon's ""Replacing Darwin"" Explaining the Flawed Methodology as well as Jeanson's Lack of Understanding some of the Basics of Evolutionary Theory","Their conclusion is pasted below:

 

* Jeanson argues that the nested hierarchy pattern of differences in mtDNA might not indicate common descent, and instead fit a design model. He offers no evidence to support this idea but proposes a way it could be tested. The only problem is that that test would be prohibitively difficult to actually perform, and even though Jeanson won’t be the one striving to do it, he says that we should suspend all judgment until the test has been done. That’s not how science works. We go with the best evidence available at the time, and in this case, it doesn’t support him.
* Instead of paying attention to patterns of nested hierarchy, Jeanson says that a simpler test is to use observed mutation rates and available genetic sequences to calculate the ages of groups of organisms. Starting with humans, he introduces a human mitochondrial mutation rate that’s approximately 10x too fast because he generalises the mutation rate in a particularly rapidly-mutating region of the mitochondrial genome to the entire sequence. Next, he argues that we “evolutionists” *must* assume constant mutation rates to be internally consistent with our own approach, but gives himself a fair bit of wiggle room in this department.
* Using his faulty mutation rate, a wide range of generation times, and data on the number of mtDNA sequence differences between human populations, humans and Neanderthals, and humans and chimps, Jeanson concludes that evolutionary timescales are far too long to accurately match the data. Instead, he shows that, with some significant massaging (invoking unrealistic generation times, increased mutation rates, and the supposed unreliability of ancient DNA sequences), he can get the human mtDNA diversity to fit into a 6,000-year timeframe.
* Jeanson claims that mitochondrial haplogroups provide evidence of all modern humans tracing their maternal ancestry back to 3 women and that these 3 women were the wives of Noah’s sons that repopulated the world after the flood. This conclusion was based on a catastrophic misunderstanding of phylogenetic tree topology ([it wouldn’t be the first time](https://roohif.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/the-cytochrome-b-equidistance-problem/)).
* He performs similar calculations for 7 other animal genera (“kinds”) with data available and says that 3 of them matched his predictions. Even if I generously count the human and Daphnia data as matching his predictions, ignore the *P. pacificus* data, and add in my own analysis of the chimps and bonobos, Jeanson’s model still has a less than 50% success rate. I don’t think that’s very impressive, but Jeanson is confident he’s on the right track.
* Throughout the discussion of the discrepancies between observed mutation rates and evolutionary timescales Jeanson consistently avoids the explanation that the mainstream literature provides: time-dependent mutation rate slowdown. He does mention natural selection as a possible explanation but dismisses it because it’s not predictive and therefore unscientific. Except, as I show, it *does* make predictions which been found to be accurate. He will bring up his critique of natural selection as an explanation again in the next chapter, and I will expand more on this subject then.

This is just...not even close. At all. I don't know about the third author, but Carter and Sanford are both geneticists. They know better. This is not what the Y or mt MRCA means. 

[We've been through this before,](https://np.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/7bnqz7/embarrassingly_bad_genetic_analysis_by/) but briefly, the Y-MRCA is the male from whom all extant *Y chromosomes* are descended.

&gt; I really don't think that there is any point trying to prove this sort of stuff to people who ardently believe in evolution. There is nothing that you can say that will convince them. Things like probability and design that would be totally obvious to them and us in other areas are twisted and reinterpreted in bizarre ways to allow them to continue to believe in evolution.

&gt; I don't have the energy to point out the problems in this because it is guaranteed to go absolutely no where. He is implying that we are looking for a designer and have to know/have evidence of the designer. That's not true and not a requirement for deciding if something is designed or not. He is also impying that he needs to know the mechanism for how something was made before it can be classified as being designed. This too is ludicrous. You can take a radio to any civilized people from 200 years ago and they can tell that it is designed. The don't know anything about the company that made it or the process/mechanism by which it was made. We tell if something is designed by looking at it to see if it has features of design and features that cannot be explained by the natural processes that we see around us.

&gt; I just can't keep trying to bash some sense into these people. It seems like a complete waste of time. It would be different if any of them actually ever admitted to learning something from our conversations, if there was any benefit at all. Personally, I try to make sure that when I discuss something at /r/debateevolution (and am not called a fool or a liar by people who don't even know me) and when I learn something (typically about biochemistry) that I make a point of saying so and appreciating it.

He gets pats on his back from fellow creationists, but [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aopqi2/not_all_id_probability_arguments_are_afterthefact/eg40k56/) from Br56u7 reveals how much projection these people vomit without the slightest hint of irony:

&gt; Personally, I try to make an effort to refute some of their arguments for the people here, or just to challenge myself. But the intellectual dishonesty is frustrating. I'm being reminded of all this now as people accuse me of being a white supremacist their.

He seemingly forgets that he just made a point to say that he wants an ethnostate with only whites (non-minorities, he says, but then admits non-minorities is only white people) who speak fluent English and assimilate into American culture, but can't define what this culture is. He unfortunately does not comprehend that this makes him a white supremacist.

To further illustrate the disconnect that those creationists have with what they believe we're guilty of, Dzugavili, one of the few rational people allowed to post on /r/creation, [commented](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aopqi2/not_all_id_probability_arguments_are_afterthefact/eg2ox0i/):

&gt; The problem is that the vast majority of the universe doesn't appear to be underdoing abiogenesis: thus, there is no violation of large numbers. As you put it:

&gt; &gt; A favorite example of a violation of the law of large numbers is coming across a table where 500 fair coins are 100% in the heads configuration. We would not expect randomly flipped coins to do this!

&gt; You might, if there were literally billions of tables, all around you. The law of large numbers suggests that eventually, given enough trials, this situation will occur.

&gt; The fatal flaw in Sal's argument is that he hasn't checked any other tables. He's looked here, saw we won, then decided he was right. He actually hasn't done any of the hard work involved in checking his conclusion. There has been zero effort to reconcile the anthropic principle: that he is alive to do this measurement means he's going to be on a planet where life is already possible, and thus it will always appear to be a violation of the law of large numbers, if taken solely from this perspective.

&gt; There are over 250 billion stars in the Milky Way: we have searched one of them. Does this seem like we violated the law of large numbers, or is 250 billion unsearched stars a red flag about this argument?

And gets piled on by creationists not only misunderstanding his point, but continuing the same illogical conclusions that the OP made.

It is quite amazing that a group of people will blame this subreddit for refusing to learn anything when discussions happen, while they limit discussions on their subreddit by requiring approved commentors and refuse to address the points made by rational folks trying to explain how their conclusions were wrongly reached.

DebateEvolution,ao759j,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Human Evolution and Race,"Given the most recent thread, I think it might be wise to run a quick crash course on the emergence of race, and the differences between races, in our global population of Homo sapiens. I am not an expert, so I will try and link some studies to back my claims.

&amp;#x200B;

The anthropologic consensus is overwhelming: anatomically modern humans all evolved from Homo heidelbergensis, a species of hominid distinct from H. erectus and H. Neanderthalensis. What makes H. heidelbergensis unique from sapiens? Loads of distinct skeletal traits. Heidelbergensis has a brain case of 1000-1220 cc's (large for erectus and small for sapiens), the prognathism seen in earlier species is continuing to diminish, and the browridge is still much too large to be considered modern sapiens. We see a larger nasal cavity as well, a trend that continues in H. neanderthalensis, which would have greatly helped it's ability to warm air before it passes into it;s throat and lungs. 

H. heidelbergensis yields H. sapiens in a specialization event in Africa, and potentially  H. neanderthalensis in Europe (it isn't totally clear whether neanderthalensis is a derivative of erectus or heidelbergensis, but to my knowledge the latter is more accepted).

While inbreeding has been [confirmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947341/) to have occurred between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis (as well the latter and denisovans) all modern humans are of the same species (redundant I suppose) and all modern humans can trace their ancestry to H. Heidelbergensis primarily. This is in direct contrast to a chart shared [by u/kanbei85](https://imgur.com/a/SOGqrIo) which is incredibly outdated and proposes races split off in separate species of genus Homo. This, as shown, is patently incorrect. 

[The breakdown of race](http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/) occurred recently and quickly in human history, and differences accounted for are minor and limited to anatomic traits beneficial to the region. [Allele variance](https://web.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/papers/popstruct.pdf) is accounted for in this landmark study, which supports a single regional location for the origin of humanity in a modern sense. 

As such, assertions that genetics separate race on anything more than a level constituting ""minute regional morphologic variants"" is false, and abjectly not supported by evolutionary theory. The study of Biological Anthropology, or Human Evolution, asserts that ALL modern humans descend from a recent hominid, H. heidelbergensis, and that our races are recent phenomena dictated by geographic necessity. That isn't to say there are not genetic differences, but they are incredibly small, thus human diversity is relatively low in comparison to the other hominids (such as say, H. erectus).

All in all, at present it appears there is more variety within the ""races"" than there is between them, and there is no accepted evidence that intelligence aptitude differs through the races as they IQ cannot be isolated from socioeconomic factors at present.

He refers to himself as an ethnonationalist:

&gt; I'm more towards the far right and most of my time off this sub, has actually been researching the empirical validity of these views and I've concluded they are correct. I want ethnoracial homogeneity in the west because diversity breeds conflict and lower trust and social capital. Essentially put, in a diverse group, people have less in common and are less likely to get along and truly. [Kauffman 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X17305902) is a meta analysis of over 100 studies and encompasses almost 4 million data points. What they studied was the relationship between ethnic diversity and perceptions of out group threat. They essentially find that diversity is highly associated with higher out group threat. In fact, amongst the studies using the most accurate geographical size to measure diversity (less than 1k) 8/9 of them found the relationship. The book Schaeffer 2014 also goes over the literature fairly well too with their meta analysis and that honestly would show the same. 
&gt; 
&gt; This association is problematic because it impairs a society's [social capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital) which is the ability of a society to work together and it impacts things like happiness, health, support for the public good and numerous other measures (Schaffer 2014 also goes over the direct correlation between diversity and some of these traits too.)  The literature has gone over nearly every covariate you could think of, like socioeconomic, education, linguistic variables, immigrant status, population density, crime etc. [Dineson 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415577989?journalCode=asra), [koopmans 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24913947/) and [dineson 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00289.x) are some example studies.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why I support ethnonationalism and do not want whites to become the minority in the US. My other reason is race and IQ. [rindermein 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804158/) is a survey of intelligence experts on the matter just so you know I'm not talking bonkers here, but I do believe their are biological differences favoring east asians, whites, Hispanics and black people accordingly and that these differences are about 80% heritable. You can look at [Ruston and Jenson](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0583Lr43gAhXwQd8KHcHqAT8QFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0thbm3F_1RNZT8qZR5wmS5) for a review of 30 years of the evidence on this matter, but the Evidence is just overwhelming. For example, [piffer 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001087) looked at various intelligence related alleles across several nationalities and found that the variance correlated highly (r= .91) with national IQ data compiled from Richard Lynn. Square that r value and you find that almost 83% of the variance in national IQ scores is explained by genomic factors and that the heritability is around 83%. Of course, I don't think certain races are just less than human and I always acknowledge exceptions, but this is what the data shows and we have to take it in account for our immigration system. Regression to the mean is also why we need a race based and not just IQ based immigration system. What RM is, is that when genetic exceptions to a population mean are recorded, the children and grand children of such people will regress towards the population average for their trait. Rushton 2005 goes over this ( and its one of the ways we know these IQ gaps are genetic)

One of the major differences between science and religions is religion holds tightly to is authority.  No scientist is an authority on their subject, expert sure, but not an authority. As such, all scientists should entertain questions from students of the science.  When I say students, I mean that fairly informally, meaning to include science enthusiasts etc.

While I have always had my issues with Sal, I was able to overlook enough of them to engage with him from time to time. If for no other reason than some banter when I’m bored at work. Seeing as how Sal fancies himself a scientist, I had always thought he follows the creed of always being open to having his beliefs questions, open dialog, and freedom of speech.

I was shocked when I commented on his /r/intelligentdesign sub, saying I wasn’t surprised when he quote mined, only to be instantly banned, and being told I’m bad for business. Clearly this is reddit, and he has all the right in the world to run yet another sub, however he lost his last shed of respect I had for him, that being he was always willing to step up to the plate and have someone counter his posts.  

Claiming to hold scholarly discussions without allowing dissenting viewpoints is an oxymoron. 

Sal, if you need a place were there is no dissenting opinions to proselytize your views you can’t claim to be arguing in good scientific faith as you’re acting as an authoritarian.  Science only works with the discussion of ideas, and must be open to function, your closing of open discussion is unacceptable as long as you want to call yourself a scientist. 

Don’t take this as an apology for my saying your too scared to defend your views, calling you a snow flake who needs a safe space etc.  That’s all true as long as you’re hiding out in a sub in order to proselytize. Let people (and even this stupid for an issue that has been settled for ~150 years) both sides and come to their own conclusions.  The ONLY reason to shut down the other side of an issue is when you know your wrong, otherwise your facts should stand by themselves.

I wanted to flesh out my position a bit better, like I said earlier, we’re done here.

DebateEvolution,anif52,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,A Question to Those Who do not Accept Evolutionary Theory: How Would You Define a Transitional Fossil or Form? What Would You need to See to Classify an Organism as Transitional?,"I have frequent chats with a Young Earth Creationist friend over coffee, and we recently were discussing Paleontology. I personally find transitional fossils quite compelling in regards to evolutionary theory, and asked him what he defined a ""Transitional Fossil"" as. I couldn't get a super straight answer from him, and mentioned that I felt perhaps his worldview prevented him from having a definition at all, because to acknowledge the traits that define such an organism would put his ideology at risk were we to find something matching his stipulations. 

I gave my own definition and we agreed it was fairly solid, although he had the caveat that geologic time is an interpretable field:

&amp;#x200B;

A transitional fossil is a fossil which occupies a morphologic and geologic space between two other organisms, whose traits are a ratio of the those held by the initial species and those held by the final species. It must occupy a geologic period between the two species, or it is relegated to a sister group rather than a ""true intermediate"". If there are multiple transitional fossils or forms, the earlier forms must have a ratio of anatomical traits favoring the initial species, and the later forms must have a ratio of traits favoring the final species. 

Additional stipulations involve classification by tell-tale morphologic novelties (like the involucrum in indohyus, ambulocetus, pakicetus, rhodocetus, dorudon, basilosaurus and all living cetaceans). 

True intermediates should thus be relatively rare, although sister groups can frequently be used to track the morphologic novelties and pick up in new geologic layers (this would be delanistes in cetacean evolution).

Does this seem like a fair definition to use? 

If it does not, what do you think works better?

DebateEvolution,amz6td,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,"On the information argument, its definitions, and what it means for creationism.","Some readers here may know that I have a particular interest in the creationist ""information"" argument. Specifically, the argument that says that mutations cannot create new information, or increase information. The reason I find it so interesting is because of how poorly defined the term ""information"" actually is, in this context. 

[After my recent exchange with Paul Price](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/al8a3k/defining_new_genetic_information/), I thought it would be nice to give a basic write up of the whole information argument, to collect what we know about it, and help understand this perplexing claim. It ended up longer than I expected, so I'm sub-heading each section to make it easier for those who (forgivably) want to skim to the parts they like.

**First encounters with information:**

I remember the first time I heard a creationist say that information cannot be increased was in response to the question ""what stops microevolution from building up to macroevolution?"". The first response that came to most people's minds was gene duplication, because we initially assumed that increased information was just a fancy way of saying ""adding base pairs"". But then creationists say that duplication just duplicates information, it doesn't add anything new. So we start explaining that the duplicated gene can then mutate, thus adding something new. But no matter how many examples we presented, or how we tried to explain the mechanisms of mutation and evolution, the creationists would always have a rationalization how how it was always a loss of information.

**Does anyone know what information is?**

It didn't take long for people to start asking the question ""how are you defining information?"". The answers, or lack of answers, were not very helpful. Most creationists wouldn't even attempt to define information. Some would just point to a dictionary definition, or try to use an analogy to language, saying nothing about how it relates to genetics. Some would mention the 5 levels of Gitt information, which doesn't have any relation to information quantity. On rare occasions you would get an actual definition, but in every case they would quickly start backpedaling when examples that fit that definition were presented.

I looked through countless pages of creationist literature, from Answers in Genesis, to Kent Hovind, to the Discovery Institute. Despite page after page of claims that ""evolution cannot create information"", I didn't find a single workable definition of information.

It became clear, very quickly, that **no creationist actually knows what information is.** The creationists may have well been asking for a mutation that increases kwyjiboes, and the argument would make just as much sense.

And this left me perplexed. I knew creationists are big on blind acceptance, but this was a whole other level. How do you go from first hearing the argument, to accepting it, to saying that it's a huge deal for evolution, to posing the question to evolutionists, without once asking what information actually is? Are creationists really that...gullible? There's really no other word to describe it.

**Origins of the information argument:**

I was also left with the question of who started the whole information argument. At some point in history some creationist must have started this argument, that led to every creationist who heard it parroting it without question.

/u/stcordova may have actually found the answer. He believes it was British creationist A.E. Wilder-Smith who first used the argument, in the Huxley Memorial Debate, in 1986. 

For those interested, [Here is the audio of that debate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKtT2hDPCIU) Unfortunately it's a very long debate, but Wilder-Smith's part where he talks about information starts at about 58 minutes in. Wilder-Smith makes the common creationist claim that information can only come from an intelligent source. Later, at 1 hour and 35 minutes in, one of the evolutionists presents an example of information from natural selection and mutation. To which Wilder-Smith responds that it's not a change ""up the ladder"". Unfortunately I can't find more of Wilder-Smith's writings on the subject, so I can't elaborate much more. But it does sound reasonable that this was in fact the first usage of the information argument.

One other important aspect of that particular debate is that Richard Dawkins participated. This is particularly important because a decade later Dawkins was the subject of a video where he was supposedly stumped by the question ""can you name a mutation that has increased information in the genome?"". This, I believe, is the reason the information argument has propagated so much. So many creationists were convinced it was such a damning argument, because their greatest enemy couldn't answer it.

Since then the information argument has evolved (hurr hurr) into a number of other arguments. Dembski's Complex Specified Information, and Sanford's genetic entropy are both descendants of the information argument.

**An exchange with Paul Price:**

In the thread linked above, Creation.com's own Paul Price, under the name of u/kanbei85, was kind enough to answer some questions about the definition of information. Unfortunately, the questioning went about the same as every exchange with Paul goes: A couple of good responses at the start, then he starts to get a little shifty when the questions get difficult, before spitting the dummy and refusing to even read what he was responding to.

But before he spat the dummy, we did learn a few interesting things about information:

* Information can't be measured. For those of us here, that's not very surprising. But it's good to see a creationist actually admit it.
* Instead of measurement, you determine information quantity through intuition.
* This information intuition isn't based on any criteria, you just kind of have to ""feel"" whether information has increased or not.
* All mutations we see today are a loss of information, but creationists can't say why, it just feels that way.
* All the changes necessary to go from bacteria to humans is a gain in information. But creationists can't say why, except that ""it's obvious"".

So there you have it. I wonder if we'll see a scientific paper about that any time soon? It will be the first scientific paper that lists ""Intuition"" and ""It's obvious"" as its only experimental methods. I would think that actual PhD holding scientists would know better than to base an entire field of study around intuition, but I guess not.

**Can information actually be measured or defined?**

Paul made the claim the information is actually really hard to define and measure, but assures us that creationists are working on it.

But the problem is, I think he's wrong. I think information is actually quite easy to define, even for an informed laymen. It should be pretty easy to look through the genetic differences between humans and bacteria, and work out the sort of genetic changes that need to take place. For example, things like increases in substrate binding specificity, beneficial mutations, new proteins, new functions, increases in genetic material, increased catalytic activity. A few of these immediately jump out as things that should count as increases in information, like new functions, substrate specificity, and beneficial mutations. There would also be a few reasonable qualifiers, like benefits not being solely the result of decreased substrate specificity.

But creationists wouldn't do that, for two reasons. The first reason is that creationists don't like thinking about evolution, because it makes them uncomfortable. The second is that any examples of genetic changes that have to happen, are changes that we see happen all the time. And that makes sense, because seeing as a mutation can turn any base into any other base, there wouldn't be any basic change that they can't do. And this is a problem for creationists, because creationists have committed to the idea that information increases never happen, ever!

So rather than take their chances at being proven wrong, they just safely stay ignorant about it. You can't disprove something that isn't defined.",1,19,1549263815,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/amz6td/on_the_information_argument_its_definitions_and/

I'm sure we're all familiar with it or it's variations - something appears so unlikely to happen naturally therefore its more likely to have been made by an intelligent force is a very high level summary if not.

One of the seemingly key things proponents use to argue for it is that we should use the same criteria everywhere to determine if something was made by an intelligence or not.

This is where I think things fall apart as I think there's three big things you need to make this assessment:

1. Knowledge that at least one intelligent entity exists that is capable of manipulating whatever is necessary to make the observed outcome come to be.

2. Knowledge that things could have actually been different. This is bigger when talking about things like the speed of light and other forces than relating directly to creation/evolution.

3. At least decent estimates as to the likelihood of things under conditions present at the time and decent estimates as to the frequency of ""attempts"" for lack of a better word

I think only with those three things could we say ""the intelligence we know exists was more likely responsible than not"". We might not know which intelligence if there's multiple options, but we can guess that at least one did something.... Probably.

Now 2 and 3 alone are certainly enough to spark interest in how it happened and in some situations may lead us to discovering 1, but they are insufficient to show 1.

So because 1 is a prerequisite for reasonably assuming something was designed, the ""appearance of design"" cannot be used to prove a designer since appearing to be designed requires there be a possible designer.",1,28,1548940543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/alpbxe/is_the_watchmaker_argument_is_circular/

DebateEvolution,al8a3k,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Defining New Genetic Information,"I often see those who oppose evolutionary theory insist that new genetic information cannot arise by mutation, nor honed by natural selection. I think a major reason for this is a lack of understanding in genetics and how new and novel morphologic or chemical traits arise.


The genetic code is rather similar to the alphabet, with codons and amino acids rather than letters. In the English alphabet, we can spell various different words with different meanings with mere letter changes into sentences that have wholly unique functions in communication. 

""Cat"" can become ""Rat' with a simple point mutation or substitution.

""The cat"" can become ""The cat cat"" with a duplication event and then ""The cat sat"" with a point mutation or substitution. Perhaps a new duplication event occurs, but in a new location (The sat cat sat) followed by another substitution or point mutation and we can have ""The sad cat sat""

""The cat"" is a sentence that gives information, but through mutation (using the same alphabet) we can gain a new sentence that has a new meaning: ""The sad cat sat""


With this analogy, we see sentences become genomes and can imagine how new genetic codes might come about. In the same way ""The cat"" becoming ""The sad cat sat"", genomes mutate and gain new information with new meaning. Losing words too, can result in a new sentence, just as ""losing"" genetic information can give rise to new methods of survival. 

There are many examples of new genetic information arising in this way:

[The Lenski Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) shows e. coli spontaneously gaining the ability to metabolize citrate though a series of subsequent potentiating mutations.

The [Pod Mrcaru Lizards](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/04/lizard-evolution-island-darwin/) developed cecal valves after several decades of geographic separation from their relatives, and transitioned from an insectivorous to an herbivorous diet.

[German and Spanish mice](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-14462733) have developed an immunity to warfarin and other poisons we try to throw at them.

Darwin's finches, the peppered moths or fruit flies, they all have experienced mutations and experience morphologic or chemical change, allowing them to increase their odds of survival. But it all begins with the molding clay of evolutionary theory: mutation.

Correlates of fitness were not directly measured. Fitness was evaluated based solely on two *extremely* poor proxies: Codon correlation with host, and virulence. 

&amp;nbsp;

We can relitigate why those are terrible ways to measure viral fitness, but that horse is already dead. There are two possible explanations for how they arrived at this conclusion: Neither of these gentlemen are virologists, epidemiologists, or evolutionary biologists, so they were unaware that they were not using appropriate metrics for fitness. Or, they *did* know they were not using appropriate metrics, but they used the data the allowed them to reach the desired conclusion. 

I have no evidence that they deliberately misrepresented the evolutionary trajectory of H1N1 and the dynamics surrounding those changes (and continue to do so), so I have to believe that they are not sufficiently familiar with the intricacies of viral evolutionary dynamics, virus-host interactions, and epidemiology to see why their chosen metrics are inappropriate. 

So anytime this paper comes up down the road, feel free to refer back to this, and dispute the fundamental conclusion, that H1N1 fitness declined during the course of the 20th century. Carter and Sanford have no data to that effect. ",1,36,1548387131,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ajkw3w/so_just_a_final_update_on_carter_sanfords_h1n1/

I will use a version of creationism that is most compatible with our observations.

The thing with creationism is that the most convincing argument for it is ""God made it so it looks like evolution took place"", and it is not convincing at all.

While it seems like ""God did it"" is a simple hypothesis, all the information is contained within the word ""it"". According to the Solomonoff inductive inference formalism of Occam's razor, it means it is the most complex type of hypothesis possible. It fares better than hypotheses that assign a high credence to observations that aren't observed (like normal creationism), sure, but if there is any other theory that predicts the observed data better, it automatically loses due to its lack of predictive power.

Actually it will lose even by itself. ""It just is"" is a better hypothesis than ""God did it"", because both require a full specification of the observations, but ""God did it"" tacks on an extra entity, and we all know about Occam's razor.

So there it is. I can't steelman creationism because the strongest case for the creationist hypothesis is out-competed by a list of what we observe.

PS Same goes for ""God did evolution"". God can be razed by Occam.",1,74,1548136196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/aijs5b/steelmanning_creationism_cannot_be_done/

Apparently evolution is too much to talk to a 5 year old about. Anyway, it made me think that perhaps I should post the question to this forum since at least a portion of the answer would be relevant. 

ELI5: How to tax the ocean, how to tax the air?

Can someone please explain to me like I’m five what it is that climate change advocates actually want done? My inability to simply Google the answer to this question leaves me suspicious of the motives behind all the emotional level rage, demonstrations, and protests that I see flashed over the internet, but again, no one saying exactly what they want done about it. The amount of urgent passion does not seem to equal the solutions to global warming.

To the point of the “urgency”: If we are an evolutionary species, and the planet is alive, then why isn’t this warming understood in the context of natural evolution? If it is natural evolution (which occurs over millions of years), what can a few million humans do to stop or alter it? Wouldn’t future inhabitants simply evolve along with the host and adapt to the gradual (1 million years) or sudden (100 years) change?

The “climate deniers” don’t have my vote either. It seems from simple internet searches that their collective position is that we (America? The West? Industrialized societies?) don’t need another Government Agency to tax the gross national product of the above entities. Only this rebuttal of the denier’s sheds light on what the advocates may want but isn’t explicitly stated. It seems from this stance of the deniers that the advocates want another government agency, most likely a Global Level Agency, that has the authority to tax multinational corporations in the name of reducing the shrinking ice plateaus in Greenland, the rising sea levels in Indonesia, and the air in Los Angeles and Beijing. A tax which must inevitably reach the pockets of all citizens in some way.

DebateEvolution,agkf9p,IsaacBarco12,,t2_2ybvnyav,self.DebateEvolution,,A variety of approaches to the effect of the Origin of Species on the relationship between religion and science- which do you find most compelling- debate,"Hi folks I have started writing a blog on Theology, Philosophy and Science available here for all interested in these topics: https://theologyphilosophyscience.blogspot.com/ Here is one of my posts on approaches to the effect of the Origin of Species on the relationship between religion and science:

I think no book has had more perceived influence on the relationship between religion and science than Darwin's Origin of Species. What follows is a brief outline of different approaches to the Origin of Species effect on the relationship between religion and science. There is a lot of historical analysis available on these effects, this being an introduction to a variety of historical actors who you can investigate more yourself if you are interested. 

Darwin’s Origin of Species (origin) was read by historians of science, scientists, philosophers and theologians with implications for the relationship between religion and science which these specialists have spoken on. I define the theory of evolution most widely accepted today. The theory of evolution in the origin this definition is inspired by was either neutral, enhancing or conflicting in the relationship between religion and science because of the implications it has on the argument for biological design, an aspect of natural theology important in the relationship between religion and science. The non-religious who read the origin can be put into two groups: those who saw the origin as causing a conflict between religion and science due to the nature of evolution as presented in the origin as incompatible with key theological ideas leading to rejection of religion, and those who thought that the science of the origin is compatible with theology but are not religious for other reasons. 

The religious who read the origin can be put into two groups: those who rejected the origins claims on theological, scientific and philosophical grounds having either accepted Paley’s argument on the ground of the biblical view of man or re-established Paley’s argument on philosophical and scientific grounds. These religious people saw the origin as creating a conflict in the relationship between religion and science, due to its disagreement with the Paleyean notion of design which was theologically attractive. Another group of religious people saw the origin as being compatible with religious ideas, enhancing the relationship between religion and science by giving a better understanding of God’s creation. These religious people saw the origin as having refuted Paley’s design argument and the arguments made by the other religious group and vice versa. These views therefore coexisted on acceptance or rejection of Paley’s argument in the light of the origin.

The origin contains an argument for the theory of evolution via natural selection. Evolution is “the process by which different kinds of living organism are believed to have developed from earlier forms during the history of the earth” (Hornby and Deuter, 2015), and natural selection is “the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring” (Hornby and Deuter, 2015). Darwin published the origin in 1859, and it is these ideas that influenced the relationship between religion and science. This come about as the view of an evolving biological world differed from the view at the time that God was the intervening creator of each species of life. The reason for this was that Darwin had collected scientific evidence for biological evolution, which disputed William Paley’s argument for the existence of a designer God.
In 1802 William Paley’s “Natural Theology” was published. Paley had a great education for his time in the fields of botany, zoology, and anatomy. In “Natural Theology” Paley produces an argument for design from living organisms which are complex, implying the action of a designer in nature, just as the construction of complex human objects reveal the hand of a human designer. Paley therefore thought that the appearance of design in nature, in its complexity, order and purpose can only be explained by a designer creating nature. Paley reasons this as complexity, order and purpose are identifiers of human design, so we can identify design in other areas in the same way. To demonstrate this Paley develops a watch maker analogy. The analogy is formulated in the following way: if one comes across a watch on a heath it is reasonable to assume that it had a designer and was not created by natural forces. We think this because a watch contains many intricacies which originate from design, and by analogy we can argue that living organisms are designed as they too contain intricacies to an even greater degree. An example of design in nature Paley gives is that “there is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for vision, as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it” (Gregory, 2009 pp 602-611). Paley’s argument was developed to further make the relationship between religion and science complimentary, science producing evidence for the existence of God which fit with the Biblical view of creation. 

Charles Darwin read and praised Paley’s work however after his publication of the origin he wrote in his autobiography “the old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered"" (Darwin and Darwin, 1893 p 87). Darwin therefore thought that the origin refuted Paley’s design argument. Richard Dawkins, a contemporary evolutionary biologist has written on this in “The Blind Watchmaker”. The title itself refers to Paley’s argument, however where Paley evidenced the need for a designer in nature Dawkins sees instead a blind process. This is because Dawkins holds that evolution via natural selection is a blind process which creates the mere appearance of design in living organisms, rather than evidence for design itself. As Dawkins puts it “biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose” (Dawkins, 1996 p 1). To say that evolution is a blind process means that it is unguided, with no foresight or goal. This entails that there is no design in evolution via natural selection and that it is a wholly natural process, replacing the argument of Paley’s for a mindful, purposeful designer of natural organisms (Coyne, 2011). Dawkin’s developed this argument to demonstrate that the origin refuted the Paleyean notion of design which created a conflict in the relationship between religion and science as it removed the need for a creator of life, which allows one to reject religion and accept science. 

Samuel Wilberforce was an English bishop in the Church of England in the nineteenth Century, who agreed with the view of Dawkins that evolution as presented in the origin was incompatible with religion. The reason for this was because Darwin applied natural selection to man as well as the animals around him. This caused issue with Wilberforce as he saw such a notion as incompatible with the Bibles view of mans moral and spiritual condition. Mans ruling of the earth, mans power of speech, reason, free-will and responsibility, mans fall and redemption, the incarnation, the indwelling spirit are all seen as incompatible with man not being distinct from the animals, being an animal himself. Furthermore, Wilberforce took the origin to be incompatible with Gods providence to intervene in nature, for creation is a result of the mind of God, a view which the origin dishonours (Wilberforce, 1860). Such a critique was done to demonstrate that the origin was incompatible with the Biblical view of man and creation which means that the origins scientific argument cannot be incorporated into natural theology creating a conflict between religion and science as there will be those who take the origin to be science and reject religion on its basis and those who do not take the origin to be science or don’t engage with science on the grounds of the Bible and potentially refuted natural theology. 

Asa Gray a nineteenth century Botanist disagreed with Wilberforce’s views of the origin. Gray started his natural theology with a belief in God, seeing design in nature because of the belief in a designer, design in nature being evidence from God (Miles, 2012). Contemporary historian of science T. Russel Hunter has claimed Gray gave examples such as the human eye as clearly giving evidence of design due to the way they adapt to the condition of existence, it not mattering if it come from an act of design or a natural process. It is in this point that Gray disagrees with Paley’s design argument, as inference to design is solely in the existence and observation of intricacies in nature regardless of how it comes about. As such Darwin’s theory did not do away with the existence of the all-powerful creator, rather natural laws such as natural selection which govern the production of nature add to the conclusion that God exists. For Gray the creator who bought into existence designed natural laws which bought about nature was a new level of creation, not destroying the design hypothesis, rather enhancing it (Hunter 2012 p966-969). In doing so Gray sought to utilise an acceptance of the origin to inform how God created life, a notion leading to rejection of the Paleyean view of biological design, the science of the origin taking its place, creating enhancement between religion and science in the process.

A God that designed natural laws which gave rise to the natural world has been used by contemporary cell and molecular biologist Kenneth Miller. Miller has engaged extensively in contemporary debate on the notion of biological design as a way of helping preserve what he took to be good science and theology. Miller drew on Thomas Aquinas who claimed that when it is demonstrated that something in the natural world has a natural cause it does not take God out of the picture because God is the author of the natural world. The natural world is therefore a part of God’s providential plan. For Miller evolution is a natural process which is part of this providential plan, and furthermore demonstrates God’s grandeur in creating. This is because God does not have to constantly violate the created natural laws, by supernaturally intervening in the natural world to create (Miller, 2009).It is because of this Miller rejects Paleyean notion of biological design, promoting scientific investigation as a way of informing the religious view of creation in its place, the science of the origin enhancing the relationship between religion and science by this means. 

Peter Bowler a contemporary historian of biology has proposed an idealist concept of design somewhat like Miller’s seeking to make the relationship between the science of the origin and the natural theology of religion compatible by having a design argument which fits with the argument for evolution in the origin. This is because argument draws from the overall pattern of creation, rather than the adaptation of individual species to their environment. Bowler sees Paley’s argument as utilitarian as it emphasised the utility of each characteristic as it helped species adapt to their environment. Each creature therefore reflects the creators purpose for that creature the purpose a reflection of its design. This differs from the idealist concept of design as there is an overall plan, rather than dealing with individual species an example to demonstrate this being the fossil record. Where the Paleyean would see the design of certain species with certain characteristics in the fossil record the idealist would see a progressive unfolding of a structured plan of creation. Pre-Darwinian nineteenth century biologist Lois Agassiz argued the history of vertebrate life contains a pattern of development which led to the human form. Furthermore, Agassiz held to recapitulation theory, which claimed that embryological development and the progression of life have the same plan (Bowler 1977 pp 29-43). Bowler engages with this argument to demonstrate that the science of the origin can be accepted alongside a Christian view of creation which draws on natural theology. In doing so the relationship between the science of the origin and religion is neutral, there not being a conflict as God could use evolution to create. This leads to a rejection of the Paleyean notion of biological design, an idealist notion proposed in its place. Bowler holds that the origin is compatible with religion but is not religious. 

Paley and Darwin had different views of natural theology to these, which are reflected in Darwin’s own opinions of the effects of the origin on the relationship between religion and science. Darwin aligned with the Paleyean view of design, going from design in nature to a belief in God, design therefore being evidence for the existence of God (Miles, 2012). Because Darwin held that Paley’s argument had been refuted by the origin, he saw conflict between the science of the origin and the natural theology of the religious. This is disputed by contemporary thinkers who claim the origin has been refuted by post Darwin developments in biology, which have allowed for the re-establishment of Paley’s design argument. This group have come to be known as advocates of Intelligent Design (ID). 

ID theorists re-established Paley’s argument via complex biochemical machines. Biochemist Michael Behe was behind this in his arguments for ID, in the form of appearance of design and ‘irreducible complexity’ (ICY) in systems. Behe says that “design is simply the purposeful arrangement of parts” (Behe 1996 p 193). He claimed a biochemical system which demonstrated this is the bacterial flagellum. The bacterial flagellum is an outboard motor that bacteria use to swim. To achieve this function, it has several parts which are ordered to that effect, a motor, a rotor, a stator, a bearing, a u-joint, and a propeller, the parts ordered for a purpose, so design can be inferred (Luskin, 2008). Like Paley Behe goes from the appearance of design in nature to the claim that there is design, however he also challenges Darwinian evolution by adding an extra argument for the inference of ID which he coined ICY. In the origin Darwin claims “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down” (Darwin 1860 p 189). This allowed for Darwin’s theory to be falsified and it is in Behe’s argument for the existence of ‘irreducibly complex’ (IC) systems that this challenge is met. 

To demonstrate ICY Behe used an analogy of a mousetrap. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. For the mousetrap to work all the parts need to be in place for it to function, as the removal of any one part destroys the function of the mousetrap. Behe claims that the bacterial flagellum is the same, that if one was to remove a part of the motor or u-joint of the flagellum as examples it would no longer be able to swim and would die. This poses a problem to Darwin’s theory as it entails that the entirety of the bacterial flagellum must be in place before it can function, and evolution needs function for there to be modification. From the appearance of design and IC systems Behe claimed to have demonstrated that design can be inferred, and the origin refuted, creating complimentary reconciliation between religion and science as he provided scientific evidence for the existence of God, at the same time as removing potential conflict (Behe 1996).

These are just some of the responses that have arisen on the relationship between religion and science within the origin, if you enjoyed reading this YouTube is as a great resource to listen to people like Kenneth Miller, Richard Dawkins and Michael Behe on these questions and suggest as reading Peter Bowler's ""Monkey Trials and Gorilla Sermons: Evolution and Christianity from Darwin to Intelligent Design"".

DebateEvolution,aft2kx,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Any Challenge to Evolutionary Theory Must Also Challenge the Antiquity of the Earth which is Impossible due to Modern Laws of Physics,"  Most challenges to the age of the Earth (4.8 bya) come from Young Earth Creationists who argue that the Earth is some 6000 years  old, and explain the geologic column by the Noachian Deluge (Noah's Ark). The problem with this lies in the nature of many of the geologic processes, which release heat, According to YEC's we must then cram 4.8 billion years into 6000 years, which creates massive issues no current Creationist can account for.

Where did all the heat go? If the geologic record was deposited in a year , then the events it records must also have occurred within a year, which as previously mentioned, creates issues with heat dispersal. 

\- **Subduction (a mechanism to explain rapid continental drift)** John Baumgardner created the runaway subduction model, which proposes that the pre-Flood lithosphere (ocean floor), being denser than the underlying mantle, began sinking. The heat released in the process decreased the viscosity of the mantle, so the process accelerated catastrophically. All the original lithosphere became subducted; the rising magma which replaced it raised the ocean floor, causing sea levels to rise and boiling off enough of the ocean to cause 150 days of rain. When it cooled, the ocean floor lowered again, and the Flood waters receded. Sedimentary mountains such as the Sierras and Andes rose after the Flood by isostatic rebound. \[Baumgardner, 1990a

The main difficulty of this theory is that it admittedly doesn't work without miracles. \[Baumgardner, 1990a, 1990b\] The thermal diffusivity of the earth, for example, would have to increase **10,000 fold** to get the subduction rates proposed \[Matsumura, 1997\], and miracles are also necessary to cool the new ocean floor and to raise sedimentary mountains in months rather than in the millions of years it would ordinarily take.

Baumgardner estimates a release of **10\^28 joules** from the subduction process. **This is more than enough to boil off all the oceans**. In addition, Baumgardner postulates that the mantle was much hotter before the Flood (giving it greater viscosity); that heat would have to go somewhere, too.

\- **Magma.** The geologic record includes roughly 8 x 10\^24 grams of lava flows and igneous intrusions. Assuming (conservatively) a specific heat of 0.15, this magma would release 5.4 x 10\^27 joules while cooling 1100 degrees C. In addition, the heat of crystallization as the magma solidifies would release a great deal more heat.

\- **Limestone formation**. There are roughly 5 x 10\^23 grams of limestone in the earth's sediments \[Poldervaart, 1955\], and the formation of calcite releases about 11,290 joules/gram \[Weast, 1974, p. D63\]. **If only 10%** of the limestone were formed during the Flood, the 5.6 x 10\^26 joules of heat released would be enough to boil the flood waters.

\- **Meteorite impacts**. Erosion and crustal movements have erased an unknown number of impact craters on earth, but Creationists Whitcomb and DeYoung suggest that cratering to the extent seen on the Moon and Mercury occurred on earth during the year of Noah's Flood. The heat from just one of the largest lunar impacts released an estimated 3 x 10\^26 joules; the same sized object falling to earth would release even more energy. \[Fezer, pp. 45-46\]

5.6 x 10\^26 joules is enough to heat the oceans to boiling. 3.7 x 10\^27 joules will vaporize them completely. Since steam and air have a lower heat capacity than water, the steam released will quickly raise the temperature of the atmosphere over 1000 C. At these temperatures, much of the atmosphere would boil off the Earth.

Aside from losing its atmosphere, Earth can only get rid of heat by radiating it to space, and it can't radiate significantly more heat than it gets from the sun unless it is a great deal hotter than it is now. (It is very nearly at thermal equilibrium now.) If there weren't many millions of years to radiate the heat from the above processes, the earth would still be unlivably hot.

**If all of the above required events were to occur in a single year,** ***not even including*** **the required radiometric decay which would also have to be crammed into 6000 years, the number of joules released is 1.626 X 1028.**

**This number can be divided by TWENTY-FIVE and STILL boil the oceans at 6.504 X 1026.**

TLDR: You cannot attempt to dismantle evolution from a standpoint that is already deeply flawed from a physics standpoint: 6000 years cannot handle all the heat release so Adam and Eve would've been sweating.

SCIENCE, , MATH, HISTORY, AND PHILOSOPHICAL 

&amp;#x200B;

Science = Impericle Evidence(Science you can test for yourself; that you see)

\- Scientist are biased when doing impericle evidence because of their pre-conceived belief of what they were taught in schools. 

\-Evolution is not something you see therefore it is not Impericle Evidence

\-You can see something that evolves, changes, or transition, but 

You can't see something that evolves beyond it's scope and level, where it transforms into a total different kind of creature/organism. It's just not how it works

The only way it can transform into another creature/organism is through INTELLIGENT DESIGN

If you naturally leave it a lone, It violates the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics

\^ What is 2ndLT, it is the law of Entropy

&amp;#x200B;

ENTROPY, IN SHORT - meaning Everything fall a parts, decay

Therefore If you leave Evolution by itself with Nature, Entropy will be in play. 

In the video it shows

\- The odds of evolution is beyond impossible

\- If you go to a human geneticist today, and ask them is the human population genetically degrading today. They will universally say YES!

 \- If you go by the standard evolutionist timeline, we would be extinct a long time ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

LONG MEANING/EXPLANATION: 

&amp;#x200B;

It's simply means decay or disorderliness in layman's terms. This is because molecules will always move or turn to dispersed to their most stable state ie. From unstable (organised) to more stable form when left alone. Molecules themselves do not form complex, structured entities when left by themselves, but rather they disintegrate, rust, rot or break down. FYI energy and matter are interchangeable, so entropy doesn't only refer to energy but matter too as well.

The universe is an isolated system, the earth is part of the universe, hence taking the universe as a whole, evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. Since evolution states that entropy decreases over time in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

If we go by the assumption that the earth is not part of the universe(an isolated system), hence its an open system, there is no way the sun's energy could have reduced the entropy of the universe in the absence of chlorophyll plant life which according to evolutionists we're not in existence at the beginning.﻿

&amp;#x200B;

Living things are open systems because they can exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. However, increased order into an open system can only occur if certain conditions are met. Order can only be produced in an open system when it contains pre-existing information in the mechanism. In other words, it needs the presence of an ordered producing machine, which contains a program for converting the undirected energy in such a way that the low entropy distribution is formed. For example, if the small inner space of a refrigerator with low temperatures imports electrical energy from outside then it will cool down the air within the refrigerator while warming up the air outside the refrigerator. In this way, low entropy distribution is produced. Higher order has emerged by the import of electrical energy into the open system. However, without the complex mechanism of the refrigerator the process would not have taken place, even with an unlimited amount of energy. Living organisms are further examples of open systems which can produce order when energy is supplied but only when the living organism contains pre-existing information in the mechanism. A plant has the mechanism of photosynthesis which takes the Sun's energy and converts it to energy for growth. Green leaves convert carbon dioxide and water molecules into oxygen and complex carbon hydrates. This entropy decrease (disorder to order) will never take place, even if the entire energy of the sun was available, unless the complicated photosynthesis mechanism pre-exists in the chloroplast of the leaves. It must already contain the information in the mechanism for order to be produced. Is it enough to export energy from the Sun to obtain complex order out of disorder? The answer is No! It is not enough to import energy from the Sun. The condition for an open system like living organisms must contain information in the mechanism for the order to be produced. When energy is switched on nothing new will emerge unless ordered information already exists before the process starts. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that order turns into disorder. Evolution claims that disordered molecules can eventually turn into specifically complex ordered molecules. Evolution is excluded from the open system condition because it does not contain the pre-existing information in the mechanism for order to be produced. It doesn't matter how much of the Sun's energy you add, you cannot get functional complexity when there is the absence of pre-existing programs, information or machines. You have to have an intelligent mind or a programmed machine imposing order on matter. Matter never spontaneously forms codes and programs from nothing. Where did the information, codes and machinery in our biological systems come from? The only logical answer is from an intelligent mind imposing order on matter. In addition, random chance follows in the direction of more disorder. Therefore, evolution contradicts the Second Law of Thermodynamics.﻿

&amp;#x200B;

The 2ndLT does not prevent life from forming, it just makes it EXTREMELY UNLIKELY(MATHMATICALLY UNLIKELY), and from the odds we see, it is rather safe to call it IMPOSSIBLE by mere chance. Even to not such extreme odds of life forming, if dye was put in a glass of water at room temp, the dye can all form and spell the word CELL. The 2ndLT does not prevent it from doing that simple act. Will it do it, it's unlikely because there is no inner machine to constrain the dye to make it spell CELL and the dye will take its most likely path and blend in all over the water, which it does. 

&amp;#x200B;

HISTORY:

History demands Christianity to be true, no other religion that has historical evidence compared to the bible. 

EXAMPLES: 

\-The new testament agrees with 90% of the 5,000+ Greek Manuscripts made.

\-Israel, how is Israel still around? They been destroyed so many times over and over. How is their culture and language still here? All other cultures in the times of Israel is gone.

\-Alexander the Great

\- Siege of Tyre

PHILOSOPHICAL - Common sense to every day life

&amp;#x200B;

When we see a complicated creation/design. Do we take that as something that can naturally come to be, nothing created it, or a intelligent person did it.

PROPHECY

&amp;#x200B;

The bible has predicted many things in the bible that came true, He also has a lot of predictions of the future. I will only show a few examples of them but they're are many others. 

Revelation 11:9 KJV

And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

\^ In end times - ""NATIONS SHALL SEE THEIR BODIES"" this is only possible through TV/internet

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2 Timothy 3:1-2 KJV 1

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

\^ this is obviously instagram, snapchat, tiktok, facebook, pininterest, etc. We are near end times.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people choose not to believe in God because of their own PERSONAL DESIRES. It gives them freedom from God's rules. For that many will not accept it. If it were all TRUE then your whole life would drastically change and people want to do what THEY WANT. Not what God wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you gotten this far. I ask you guys to put a little faith in God, that he sent his son Jesus to die for our sins. If you say you believe this with all your heart. YOU WILL HAVE ETERNAL SALVATION. WHAT DO YOU GUYS HAVE TO LOSE?

John 3:16

DebateEvolution,afderf,HmanTheChicken,,t2_dak76sj,self.DebateEvolution,,What epistemic justification could a Christian have for believing in evolution?,"The sub is not for debating religion in of itself, so I'll try to avoid going through that. But, let's say someone believes they have good evidence that Christianity is true. Let's say they find the arguments for the Resurrection (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_Db4RwZ_M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8lkuuhVkOI) very compelling, and they are fairly certain about Christianity. The more they look into it, the more it becomes a real truth in their lives. 

I'm not a Protestant, but Martin Luther's distinction between the Magisterial and Ministerial use of reason seems to be pretty valid: 

&gt;&gt;""What then is the role of argument and evidence in knowing Christianity's truth? I’ve already said that the fundamental way in which we know the truth of Christianity is through the self-authenticating witness of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the only role that is left for argument and evidence to play is a subsidiary role. Here I think Martin Luther correctly distinguished between what he called the magisterial and the ministerial uses of reason. What are these? The magisterial role of reason occurs when reason stands over and above the Gospel like a magistrate and judges its truth or falsity on the basis of argument and evidence. By contrast, the ministerial use of reason occurs when reason submits to and serves the Gospel message. In light of the Holy Spirit’s witness, I would say that only the ministerial use of reason is legitimate. Philosophy is rightly the handmaid of theology. Reason is a God-given tool to help us better understand and defend our faith; as St. Anselm put it, ours is a faith that seeks understanding. A person who knows that Christianity is true on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit may also have a sound apologetic which reinforces for him the truth of what the Holy Spirit says. We can imagine a person who has both the witness of the Holy Spirit and good arguments from natural theology and Christian evidences for the great truths of the Gospel. This person can be said to have a kind of dual warrant for the truth of his Christian beliefs. Such a person is doubly warranted in his Christian belief in the sense that he has two sources of warrant for what he believes which are independent of each other.""

From William Lane Craig - https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3/s3-excursus-on-natural-theology/excursus-on-natural-theology-part-3/

So let's say that they accept this distinction, and really, that distinction seems to follow from God's nature. Then they also say that Biblical inerrancy and some form of Scriptural perspicuity is a foundational doctrine of Christianity that cannot be judged with the ministerial use of reason. Obviously evolution contradicts the plain reading of the Bible, and if they say that the plain reading of the Bible is infallible, they wouldn't really be able to be justified in believing in evolution. 

At this point, that is my reasoning for disbelieving in evolution - and really for going toward belief in a Young Earth. I'm happy to accept that the scientific evidence for evolution and an old earth is fairly good, but, a Christian's starting point should be God and His word, not human scientific theories. Ken Ham's usual ""where you there?"" question in of itself is kind of pointless. No we weren't there, and so if that's what's necessary to justify your side, nobody can be right. We can look backwards at the past. The question has to be which witness you use for that. For a Christian, how can they be justified in believing in evolution? The witness that we should use, God, seems to have no knowledge of evolution. 

Going a bit from philosophy of science/theology/epistemology to science itself, isn't it true that science will start off with axioms and that the axioms determine the result? Why would evolution being false or even a Young Earth be a bad set of axioms if God is your epistemic starting point?

Given that there's such a thing as collateral ancestry, however, and that collateral ancestry could *in theory* explain any discrepancy from the expected order (anything could be a ""sister group"" if it's not an ancestor), does palaeontology really make ""hard"" predictions about when we should or should not find a certain fossil? Isn't it rather a matter of statistical tendencies, a “broad pattern”? And if so, how can the prediction be formulated in an objective way?

So for instance, Shubin famously predicted that he would find a transitional fossil between amphibians (365mn years and later) and fish (385mn years ago), which lived between 385 to 365mn years ago. But was he right to make that prediction so specifically? What about the fossil record makes it inconceivable that amphibians were just too rare to fossilise abundantly before this point, and that the transitional fossil actually lived much earlier?

We now know (or have good reason to suspect) that [he was wrong](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/the-tracks-of-a-ghost/). Tiktaalik remains, of course, fantastic evidence for evolution and it certainly is *roughly* in the right place, but the validation of the highly specific prediction as made by Shubin was a coincidence. Am I right to say this?

Tl;dr: People often seem to make the strong claim that fossils are *never* found in a chronologically incorrect place. *In exact terms*, what does that mean?

A bit about me. Raised as a Christian in a Christian household. I was taught the literal story of creation as laid out in Genesis. I have heard the evidence for a global flood and young earth (6000 or less years). Through this process, I have also been informed of the arguments against the theory of evolution. That is, that all life originated from a single cell organism some 4 billion years ago. 

I still believe in literal creationism. I believe the arguments that I have been taught in support of creationism and in opposition to evolution make sense.

Needless to say I was not impressed his empty argument. 

Starting with the null hypotheses that we don’t know anything about the historical (and in that case future) rates of processes. We must look at the evidence as to what the rate of processes has been doing. We do evidence from [Astronomical spectroscopy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy), that these rates have been consistent. We also have more terrestrial evidence that uniformitarianism is the most likely scenario, namely the Okla reactors in Gabon, and also comparing fossil assemblages to multiple dating techniques.  I’m sure I’m missing some great examples, so feel free to educate me, preferably with peer reviewed journal articles. 

How to impress me with criticism of widely accepted theories:

Before we start, let’s be very clear, the number of people who accept a theory has no relevance for it’s accuracy (argumentum ad populum), for example evolution is not very likely accurate because most people believe it best explains the biodiversity we see today, but because of how many independent lines of study support the theory.  

First, when attacking a theory, or more likely when it comes to evolution, part of a theory, please explain that you understand the evidence for the theory, and if you disagree with a piece of evidence, explain why you don’t think the evidence in valid. Without this step, your attack is invalid, as you must understand something to understand explain why it is wrong. 

Example: often see the claim that earth’s magnetosphere is weakening. Yet the people who argue that it’s going to decline to zero neglect to explain why we see the zebra stripes in the oceanic rock formed by the reversal of the magnetic pole recorded when the oceanic crust cooled below it’s curie temperature. Don't be dishonest when forming your argument.

Secondly you must explain why the evidence better fits your idea than the current model.

Example: Long before Einstein proposed the theory of relativity, it was clear the Kepler’s laws of motion broke down under certain situations. Yet as this was the best theory we had, it was used until Einstein resolved the issues. His theory is still being tested today. 

Finally if discussing something such as a change the rate of processes believed to be constant, you must propose a mechanism for the change to occur. 

Example: Germ theory.


That’s it, just three steps. However without those three steps, I personally see no reason at all to take your argument seriously at all.  

Back to the topic of uniformitarianism for a brief moment.  I really don’t understand the idea that uniformitarianism supports ideas such as accelerated decay rates supports the biblical version of creation. In order to convince me that’s true, you have to show evidence that the rates changed, the mechanism of change, and of course explain where the heat went etc. etc. etc. 

Assuming for a second that uniformitarianism is incorrect, I don't see a point of continuing on with science until we can understand that drives the changes in the rates of processes. 

I look forward to hearing any criticism of my view on this.

DebateEvolution,abjckr,ThurneysenHavets,MA Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,The “linguistic entropy” argument for a young earth (and some reasons why it’s crap),"A rather fun creationist argument I’ve come across a few times now runs roughly as follows.

&gt;Languages tend to simplify over time (e.g. English lost much of its case inflection). This means languages were more complex in the past. Since the mainstream scientific view is that languages (at some point in time) evolved from *less* complex precursors, this is unexpected from an evolutionary point of view. However, it is perfectly compatible with a supernatural event, like the Tower of Babel, where languages were created in their full complexity which subsequently degenerated.

This is an argument one might term “linguistic entropy”, by analogy with the genetic argument this sub is all too familiar with. Predictably, it's nonsense. I’ll try and keep it short. There are three main problems with the argument.

&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, *loss of inflection* is not the same as *simplification*. It is easy to conceive of, and find examples of, analytical (non-inflecting) languages which make more grammaticalized distinctions in a given paradigm than many synthetic (inflecting) languages. That is the kind of metric of complexity which is used in the peer-reviewed literature. If creationists want to use a different metric of complexity they need to state what that metric is and why it makes sense to prefer it.

&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, we have numerous examples of languages gaining inflection and a good understanding of how this happens. [E.g. for case endings](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklinguistics/comments/a56xq7/how_do_languages_develop_noun_cases/ebkklb6/). At best, therefore, creationists can claim that languages drift towards analyticity only as a weak *tendency*. In which case they need to provide statistically significant evidence for the existence of such a tendency. Usually, they don’t get beyond cherry-picked examples of case loss, almost invariably from western European languages.

The European bias makes the argument particularly unconvincing when one considers that many inflectional categories like case and gender are known to be strongly areal (viz. influenced by the presence or absence of such categories in neighbouring languages). So limiting your sample to the European linguistic area tells you something about tendencies in the European linguistic area, not tendencies in language generally. Kind of basic, really.

There’s various other sample biases in the creationist arguments I’ve seen but I won’t go into that here.

&amp;nbsp;

Thirdly, gain of inflection is probably harder to observe than loss of inflection. Inflection is gained through a very gradual process of grammaticalisation that might not easily be recognised as such, particular by a linguistically naive researcher ^(cough definitely nobody at CMI cough). The loss of a case marker is very obvious. So observing a slight statistical bias towards inflection loss is likely to be an artefact of observation even if creationists did succeed in controlling for all relevant variables.

Was wondering what the pro evolution answers are for these questions

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout history, people have discovered fossils of extinct species, but why are the missing links not found in abundance, if they inhabited the earth for long lengths of time?

&amp;#x200B;

We can presume the age of a fossil based on the layers of the earth, considering the way the earth changes landscapes over time, how accurate is this method, and what different methods are used to determine the age of a fossil aside from carbon dating

&amp;#x200B;

How do you tackle the entropy argument and how strong/weak an argument is it from your perspective?

&amp;#x200B;

It would take too long to observe evolution in person, but is their evidence that its possible to edit the DNA of an organism, into something different, and still have said creature be capable of sustaining and reproducing life, if not with a complex organism, at least with a micro organism. Or is their any evidence of non complex organisms developing into complex organisms.

&amp;#x200B;

Not about evolution, but are there any alternative theories on the development of life, outside evolution? Excluding creationism, I mean before Darwin, did people have other theories?

&amp;#x200B;

DebateEvolution,a7o2iw,gminor1025,,t2_7yurg4q,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolutionism believers must be consistent.,"I have a lot of scientific issues with Evolutionism but I want to talk about one in particular. Supporters of this belief inherently believe life, as we know it today, is a result of natural processes, and the genetic information comes from those, NOT, an intelligent designer. So, if your scientific hypothesis says there is no intelligent designer, you must admit, you also believe there was no such designer for the Universe's existence or the abiogenesis part of Evolution. I suppose you don't specifically have to believe in the Big Bang, but am I correct to assume that most of you do? So before you can honestly stand behind naturalistic explanations for evolution, you have to hold those same premises when explaining the parts that precede it. I recognize that I have some bias, but I can't get around believing the universe was a singularity when science clearly says they don't explode, they only emit Hawking radiation over time. And how would spacetime expand, when even non-universal scale singularities bend spacetime inwards. How did the big bang create time? Because in order for spacetime to expand, time must be created also, due to causality. Unless you believe that time exists outside of spacetime somehow. If spacetime didn't exist, then how would an explosion occur when an explosion itself requires time. Black holes are stated to be stars that were too large and can only implode, but at a certain point, they're large enough that they go back to exploding? Abiogenesis and Evolution require ridiculous amounts of time, yet all of the ""evidence"" of the age of the earth and the universe is based on assumptions about the past which can not be empirically proven. Evolution attempts to explain new sources of genetic information, but all of the empirical evidence proves Genetic Entropy, which is a loss of information. I can't produce empirical proof for Intelligent Design, I admit that, but I find plenty of empirical evidence that refutes Evolutionism. Yet I have not seen any empirical proof that refutes Intelligent Design. Will Evolutionists ever admit that their belief of ""no intelligent designer"" across the origin of the universe, abiogenesis, and evolution is in fact based more on faith and theories, rather than empirical evidence?

DebateEvolution,a79y4g,OddJackdaw,,t2_66vsowc,self.DebateEvolution,,"Some of the most flagrant quote mining I've ever seen, from our beloved Sal Cordova.","In the discussion [here, ](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a70t3v/best_proevolution_video_for_kids/) /u/stcordova linked to a [blog post](https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/two-faced-nick-matzke/) where he says this:

&gt; Did a creationist actually say this?

&gt;&gt; phylogenetic methods as they exist now can only rigorously detect sister-group relationships, not direct ancestry,

&gt; No, it was Nick Matzke at Panda’s thumb 🙂

&gt; But a creationist did say:

&gt;&gt; you get sister groups with no parent explicitly shown.

&gt; Platonic forms do not suggest we evolved from fish

&gt; 😯

&gt; Not much difference between what Matzke said and I said! I’ve been telling him that since 2006, and now he finally acknowledges it publicly.

Notice anything funny about the punctuation and capitalization of those quotes? Yep, Sal is not just taking sentence or paragraph out of context, he is literally pulling a sentence fragment out to misrepresent what the author was saying. 

This is the actual paragraph that was taken from, with the quote highlighted:

&gt; As with all creationists, Meyer exhibits no understanding of the fact that **phylogenetic methods as they exist now can only rigorously detect sister-group relationships, not direct ancestry**, and, crucially, that this is neither a significant flaw, nor any sort of challenge to common ancestry, nor any sort of evidence against evolution. Distinguishing between a close sister-group relationship and an exact ancestor is just a level of precision that we cannot expect in most cases. It’s just a by-product of the method and the data available. (This is not quite the end of the discussion on this topic – eventually, we will have Bayesian methods that will assign probabilities to hypotheses of direct ancestry, although this will require formal definition and then data-informed estimation of what “ancestral lineage” means in terms of morphological variability within a lineage, the biogeographic and stratigraphic range of “morphospecies” through times, etc. End nerdy sidetrack.) But phylogenetic methods can and do regularly and rigorously identify collateral ancestry – sister group relationships, and ancestral grades and clades. We can say that birds descend from dinosaurs with essentially 100% statistical confidence, without knowing which if any currently-described fossils are exact direct ancestors rather than closely-related sister groups.

And here is the paragraph containing the quote of Sal's that he cites:

&gt; So you can take a bird as the common ancestor of all mammals and fish. That’s exactly the problem. Whereas, the unspecified vertebrate unifies the vertebrates in the most natural way.

&gt; That’s why the transformed cladists got into hot water — they saw all the similarities, grouped them together (like I did above) and you get sister groups with no parent explicitly shown. It seems the “parent” was a common design from the mind of an intelligence, and the grouping actually preclude notions of a transitional. The fossil record doesn’t contain believable transitionals because the were none.

It is true that if you take that single sentence fragment out of the context *of the rest of the freaking sentence*, there's ""not much difference between what Matzke and [Sal] said."" 

On the other hand, if you read what the two authors *actually* said, you end up with two people saying *very* different things. Even from the sentence alone it is clear that he disagrees with Sal's interpretation, and with the entire paragraph quoted he explains in detail why Sal is wrong. 

Now that blog post is more than 5 years old... I normally wouldn't shame someone for saying something stupid that long ago. But as he continues to cite it as supporting his position, it seems worth pointing out how flagrantly dishonest he remains.

Soon after joining Reddit I discovered that name was unusable then I left it at that, with no complaints. It at least did not need covering.

Thanks to Sal's digging of the foundation work for something new there is now my example to show what being scientifically responsible looks like, to contrast what Reddit management needs to beware of and may help needing to control by having a good example you can approve of too. For that reason I very much welcome your opinion/review of the description and rules that go with the theory I currently have. The greater the contrast the quicker the tinfoil hats can be awarded to those who prove to deserve them.

In my sub I welcome all to help develop a real scientific theory, instead of bait then switch to books and videos to buy and study that have no scientific theory in them just claims that one is possible or already exists but is being suppressed by ""evolutionists"". Holding the Discovery Institute to their word in regards to ""scientific theory"" and my not being concerned by ""historical sciences"" being mixed in their text makes them look good, even though all who represent them are expected to be visibly absent from the serious development of their own theory. It's there not necessary for me to say a single word about the politics of the situation, there is just a starter theory and a couple of easy rules to follow.

Sal got what he wanted, and so did I. The moral lesson in \[King Nothing\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5j8lz4oD4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5j8lz4oD4Q)) thus play's on again, for at least one of us. But I'm confident that my new crown will not go to my head. It is after all just another Reddit forum. Being true to the common sense rules that must exist there demands that all ""Charles Darwin said"" type arguments that already fill your forum anyway might seem ruthless for me to immediately delete on sight, but that does not belong in a IDTheory forum and will not be tolerated. If someone is at least trying to explain something useful then I will help them out and recommend other places for further advice that makes what they posted worth the extra effort on their part, be proud of.

Three years before Darwin. Please don't just take my word for it; fact-check the hell out of this claim.  It was titled ""On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species"". Published THREE YEARS BEFORE Darwin.

Then, three years later, he sent a letter to Darwin, who COPIED its ideas and published his own paper. Despite the fact that pretty much everything else in his correspondences has been preserved, there's no copy of the Ternate letter (although there's a record of Darwin's reply; proving that the letter from Wallace existed). Fact-check this. Darwin is an opportunistic fraud who stole an idea and tried to hide the evidence.  


Conclusion: There is NO SUCH THING as ""Darwinian Evolution"". It's Wallacian Evolution.

DebateEvolution,a2ryet,CTR0,BS | Biology | Genetics and Synthetic Biology,t2_99a5p,self.DebateEvolution,,Human Germline Engineering vs Evolutionary Effects,"As I'm sure you're all aware, this past week or so has had some [interesting developments in the discussions of human germline engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui). I'd like to talk about the subject as it pertains to evolution.

**THESIS**: Human germline engineering as a precaution against lifetime infection is not productive for our species. Responsible engineering to prevent genetic diseases and change canonical cosmetic differences would be at a minimum harmless from an evolutionary perspective.

Realistically speaking, there's four purposes for which the human genome could be engineered.

* Prevent otherwise inevitable genetic diseases (Marfan syndrome where a parent is homozygous for it)

* Reduce likelihood of diseases of chance (BRCA1-wt and breast cancer, especially when a parent is homozygous for it)

* Reduce likelihood of genetically influenced infections (CRR5 delta-32 and HIV. This is where He_Jiankui's work stands)

* Cosmetic (Widdow's peak)

Let's stop for a moment and consider the idea that all human germline engineering is permissible, GATTACA style. **What degree of engineering is actually worthwhile, particularly in an evolutionary context?**

Obviously, even cosmetic differences can have an evolutionary effect. See the [spread of blue eyes](https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/origin-blue-eyes). I would personally disallow this class of engineering if only for the concern of eugenics (especially any mandated genetic changes) and the differences between socioeconomic classes, but we're not here for that. **Would there be any significant evolutionary concerns for genetic engineering that is more or less cosmetic?** If a trait was considered sexually attractive, would the trait not naturally increase in prevalence anyways?

Genetic engineering to fight infections, I feel, has the largest evolutionary implications. This is going to be the next antibiotic resistance problem. He Jiankui used an unstudied mutation in the CRR5 receptor (similar to the popularized delta-32 mutation) as a preventative measure against HIV where the father was HIV positive. The thing is, [we already know that there are strains of HIV that can break through delta-32 mediated resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9256936). As genetic engineering for this application gets more affordable, we will be gradually increasing the prevalence of this and like mutations to protect us against organisms with generation times 7000+ times faster than us. There are treatments to prevent HIV contraction to offspring without the use of genetic intervention, and the use as as long term 'vaccination' I feel is more or less a loosing battle in an evolutionary arms race.

I'm going to lump the two genetic disease prevention categories into one here. I think, when technology advances to the point where off target effects and mosaic effects are minimized, that this kind of engineering should be permissible. One of the interesting things about evolution is that selection is significantly less for diseases that manifest after an organism's child is raised to adulthood. For instances like BRCA1, I feel that, for the most part, we would be doing little to the evolutionary timeline outside of reducing human suffering. Similarly, in a natural situation, a debilitating genetic disease early would likely be selected against. With modern medicine, selection has been dampened. We would be acting as nature's filter without the increased chance of early death. Of course, we would have to be cautious and only edit things with clear detriments and no circumstantial benefits (I would not be a proponent of editing against Sickle Cell Anemia, for example), but it's hard to imagine situations where cancer would be beneficial to the patient.",1,11,1543864960,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a2ryet/human_germline_engineering_vs_evolutionary_effects/

DebateEvolution,a208fn,Sclooper,,t2_zerr1,self.DebateEvolution,,Muller's ratchet,"Hello everybody, I'm fairly new to posting on reddit so let me know if I'm doing something wrong. Anyway, I'm an evolutionary biologist and I've noticed that genetic entropy is a hot topic for creationists.  This is disturbing for a number of reasons. I find it problematic because discussion on both sides seems to ignore that genetic entropy is real, however it usually referred to as Muller's ratchet.  Sex, other means of genetic rearrangement, polyploidy and other mechanisms act to reverse the damage caused by negative mutations accumulating in a genome overtime.  In fact the presence of Muller's ratchet is one of the primary reasons sex is thought to have evolved in the first place.  My concern is why is sex ignored by proponents of genetic entropy? Why does this old topic need a new phrase to describe it, ""genetic entropy""?  Why do proponents of genetic entropy ignore evidence that asexual lineages have other mechanisms to reduce the cost of negative mutation accumulation (for example, see Naito &amp; Pawlowska 2016).  I think everyone on this subreddit would benefit from reading some background on Muller's ratchet, here are some places to get started [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s\_ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet) (wikipedia I know, but its a good start for non-scientist and scientist alike), [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01266.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01266.x) (a general review) [http://www.genetics.org/content/156/4/2137.short](http://www.genetics.org/content/156/4/2137.short) ( A review on the speed that this process takes place).

It shows how just looking at the end result of a random process (bugs making it through the maze) can appear miraculous or make you think they must have been guided.

It blows away the idea that we needed a designer to create life as it is or that somehow we are fine tuned.

Chemistry doesn't work that way. Nothing forms by chance. Heck you can never get a caffeine or even alcohol molecule to just form in water by chance in anyway, and as soon as you did it would break apart and dilute.

Claiming four magic amino acids that even seperately just cannot form under any circumstance by chance and then survive more than a few minutes or days could somehow have 3 other amino acids and a backbone and then just replicate and create an arrangement that produces a viable life form that also somehow just had the arrangement of these four amino acids to reproduce is just insane.

Flying spaghetti monster is more scientific.

But like all other PhD's in a valid field of science, if you doubt or critique the theory you just ""don't understand the evolution"" or you simply haven't read the horrible and abysmal ""explanation"" of how abiogenesis ""DID"" happen exaxtly how evolutionists claim it did.

As you are undoubtedly aware, Answers In Genesis has now accepted speciation through natural selection as a modern solution to the age-old question, How can so many species of animals fit on the ark? Their modern solution is that only about 1000 ""created kinds"" -- roughly corresponding to families in scientific taxonomy -- of land animals were present on the ark, and that post-deluge evolution of these created kinds produced all the species we see today.

It should be mentioned that the ""created kinds"" posited by Answers In Genesis include both extant and extinct species, since they posit that no ""kinds"" of land animals were left off the ark. For instance, the ark contained many different kinds of dinosaurs, as well as kinds relating to extinct mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. It was only after the flood that these extinct ""kinds"" became fully extinct.

In addition, Answers In Genesis states that the post-deluge speciations does not depend on mutation creating new genes; all of the genes exhibited in species today were already included in the ancestral ""created kind"" included on the ark. Modern species may have lost genes through natural selection, both those ""created kinds"" on the ark had a sort of ""super genome"" that included all possible genes. For instance, the pre-flood world was populated by a ""created cat kind"" whose genome contained all the gene variants found in the modern family of Felidae, and that's what Noah let on the ark.

But these views of ""created kinds"" seems contradicted by the flood geology promoted by Answers In Genesis, in which the flood was responsible for laying down the geologic strata that we see today, and that the fossils we find in those strata are of animals that died in the flood. This seems to contradict ""created kinds"" in two ways

* Based on this, it seems like we should only find fossils of created kinds, since modern species didn't ""evolve"" until after the flood, but clearly that's not the case: for instance, we have fossils of many species of Felidae, not just a single ""created kind"", and the fossil record includes modern species. Why wouldn't the fossil record show just the ""created kind"" that modern species descended from?

* How can the fossil record include modern species descended from any ""created kind"" since Answers In Genesis says that the fossils were laid down in the flood, but the modern species didn't ""evolve"" from its kind until after the flood?",1,16,1543432525,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a19ca6/how_can_created_kinds_be_consistent_with_flood/

Not not only was this paper received with mixed opinions, but especially the resulting articles about this paper were received really really bad in /r/biology, /r/science and /r/evolution because some articles managed to misunderstand what the paper's conclusions were. This is a no-go for scientific circles.


Back then, some of the articles made their way to /r/Creation of course: [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8pg3og/massive_genetic_study_reveals_90_percent_of/) and then [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8n0dh8/results_from_study_of_mitochondrial_dna/).

You can read both threads if you want to have an overview about a) Why this paper was received with mixed opinions and b) Why articles about this paper were received negatively. But in short:

&gt; ""No, they did not find out “that 9 out of 10 animal species on the planet came to being at the same time as humans did some 100,000 to 200,000 years ago”. New species arise continuously, but they do so by going through a population bottleneck in geologically recent times. Homo sapiens arose as a distinct species between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, but that notorious London Underground mosquito may have evolved in the 18th century…which is still within the past 200,000 years, you may notice. It’s a bit like reading a statement that almost all people are less than 100 years old, and then wondering, publicly and in print, about what happened in 1918 to cause every human being on Earth to have been suddenly born in that year. That must have been some orgy to celebrate the end of the Great War.""

And why were some articles about this paper received negatively? Because for some reason, if you misunderstood the study well enough, creationists made up their mind and decided that this is a paper that actually proclaims that most if not virtually all animals (including humans) had a 2 people bottleneck at the same time.

If you thought that creationists would let go the idea of misunderstanding the concept of **Mitochondrial Eve**, then boy oh boy

&gt; Very cool! I saw this last night but was too tired to make a post here - thank you for sharing!

&gt; The idea here is that of all the species studied, each have a “Mitochondrial Eve” that lived about (supposedly) 200,000 years ago.

&gt; Given how the dates of about 200,000 years are calculated based on expected mutation rates (and how similar dates of the “Mitochondrial Eve” of humans can be argued to support a 6,000 year timeframe), it’s nice to see Creationist predictions being validated as science progresses (common ancestors thousands of years ago not millions). 

&gt; Common ancestors between species are still millions of years ago -- but the human common ancestor was never believed to be millions of years ago, simply as an argument of mathematics, as it only takes 33 generations to reach 6B ancestors.

Notice how this should be a satisfying answer? NOPE, because /u/NesterGoesBowling is still happily posting about it, just today as if nothing ever happened and as if it's new evidence, probably because just like most other creationists, he caught wind about it because of Fox News or Daily Mail:

Here is a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a004dk/mitochondrial_misinterpretations_and_some/) from our own subreddit about this whole ordeal that unfortunately did not get enough views from us so I decided to make a bigger post about it.",1,25,1543140684,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a07ga8/amnesia_in_rcreation_after_foxnews_and_dailymail/
DebateEvolution,a07g34,RibosomalTransferRNA,B.Sc. | Molecular Biology,t2_742jf5o,self.DebateEvolution,,Amnesia in creationist circles after FoxNews and DailyMail revive an old paper,"So around 6 month ago, a story broke out regarding a paper that was published (Short, called the [Stoeckle-Thaler paper](https://phe.rockefeller.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stoeckle-Thaler-Final-reduced.pdf)) that in summary reported that: ""90% of all living species has an origin in the last 100-200k years"" (this is not my summary).

Not not only was this paper received with mixed opinions, but especially the resulting articles about this paper were received really really bad in /r/biology, /r/science and /r/evolution because some articles managed to misunderstand what the paper's conclusions were. This is a no-go for scientific circles.


Back then, some of the articles made their way to /r/Creation of course: [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8pg3og/massive_genetic_study_reveals_90_percent_of/) and then [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8n0dh8/results_from_study_of_mitochondrial_dna/).

You can read both threads if you want to have an overview about a) Why this paper was received with mixed opinions and b) Why articles about this paper were received negatively. But in short:

&gt; ""No, they did not find out “that 9 out of 10 animal species on the planet came to being at the same time as humans did some 100,000 to 200,000 years ago”. New species arise continuously, but they do so by going through a population bottleneck in geologically recent times. Homo sapiens arose as a distinct species between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, but that notorious London Underground mosquito may have evolved in the 18th century…which is still within the past 200,000 years, you may notice. It’s a bit like reading a statement that almost all people are less than 100 years old, and then wondering, publicly and in print, about what happened in 1918 to cause every human being on Earth to have been suddenly born in that year. That must have been some orgy to celebrate the end of the Great War.""

And why were some articles about this paper received negatively? Because for some reason, if you misunderstood the study well enough, creationists made up their mind and decided that this is a paper that actually proclaims that most if not virtually all animals (including humans) had a 2 people bottleneck at the same time.

If you thought that creationists would let go the idea of misunderstanding the concept of **Mitochondrial Eve**, then boy oh boy

Now comes the heavy part, apparently [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/did-a-mysterious-extinction-event-precede-adam-and-eve) wrote an opinion piece just days ago and [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6424407/Every-person-spawned-single-pair-adults-living-200-000-years-ago-scientists-claim.html) followed their steps. For whatever reason, creationists are up in arms about it AGAIN. For example here is a [**thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/a014rp/all_humans_are_descended_from_a_single_malefemale/) that now spawned in /r/TrueChristian with the dishonest title ""All humans are descended from a single male-female pair"" (check the thread for juicy drama).



and [/r/Creation even made another post about it again](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a01o0p/90_of_all_animal_species_alive_today_come_from/). Funny enough, the OP is /u/NesterGoesBowling who already participated in the same debate 6 months ago about the same topic. Another new user makes a [**submission**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a03nik/gentle_correction_to_my_creationist_brothers_and/) in /r/Creation about it titled ""A gentle correction"" and it was **downvoted** and **attacked** even though it is completely justified.

DebateEvolution,9zkela,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution scientists are evil.,"To say someone is evil is to express a subjective opinion. 

I form the opinion by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, choosing the word ""evil"". I might have chosen the word ""nice"", that would be an equally logically valid opinion.

The evolution scientists have several courses of action available to them, and, according to me, evil is what makes their choices turn out the way they do, instead of another way. 

The existence of evil is therefore a matter of chosen opinion, it is spiritual. I choose the opinion it exists. 

That's how subjectivity works, an opinion is formed with a choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice. 

I look at the choices evolution scientists make, look at the consequences of their choices, look at what other options they had, and then I make an opinion on what the agency of their choices was. 

It's because of evolution scientists that the human spirit is not commonly acknowledged anymore in society. People don't acknowledge each other's emotions anymore because they don't understand how subjectivity works anymore. 

First the evolution scientist describes the entire life of organisms using subjective words, like that an organisms likes to survive, that it has fear, joy and whatever. Then the evolution scientist asserts that this is all factual. The evolution scientists assert subjective words as fact. 

Second the evolution scientist asserts creationism is wrong, while subjective opinion, as explained, is a creationist concept. 

So 1 and 2, it is a double slam against subjectivity, which results in particularly higher educated people having no clue about how subjectivity works, and disregarding people's emotions. Almost 100 percent of scientists accept evolution, so it basically applies to all scientists, not just evolution scientists. 

If I post on the internet about the human spirit it is certain everybody there will require evidence for this spirit thing. Nobody has a clue anymore about how subjectivity works. Certainly society has become a bad joke, where it is held to be virtue to systematically ignore people's emotions, because it is virtue to adhere to the scientific method in all cases.

The schoolbook for the Hitler Youth shows where teaching evolution science ends up. The book starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"", and then it proceeds to claim that the content of character of people is a factual issue of racial science. 

Evolution scientists are evil, evolution theory must be destroyed. 

Actually creationists are guilty too, because it seems I am the only creationist in the entire world teaching about subjectivity. If many creationists taught about subjectivity, then the bad influence of evolution theory would be limited. But for now creationists teach more or less the right structure of subjectivity in regards to God and the human soul, but they do not teach it in detail.

* Natural Selection is Constrained by Selection Interference

* Deleterious Mutations are being introduced faster than they can be removed

* Most mutations are nearly neutral, not simply neutral.

I've got quite a busy day, and I don't have time for a full breakdown of the arguments, but I'm obviously opposed to his position. I sort of alluded to this at the lecture in person during questioning, but his entire position depends on us humans starting out at a fitness of 1.

DebateEvolution,9unyh9,RibosomalTransferRNA,B.Sc. | Molecular Biology,t2_742jf5o,self.DebateEvolution,,Evidence against the theory of Universal Common Ancestry,"By /u/stcordova

1) biological systems that are unlikely to evolve for a common ancestor based on known facts.

1.a) If a Darwinist says, ""we don't know how it evolved, but it evolved"" that's saying ""we don't know"" -- that is not proof of universal common ancestry, but a statement of faith without fact.

2) At most one can say proteins obey an APPROXIMATE nested hierarchical pattern. BUT, there are lots of taxonomically restricted proteins (aka proteins missing a common ancestor), and also all of the major protein families do not have a common ancestor! OOPS!

3) Furthermore, there are mechanical issues evolving new proteins that are integrated into new systems.

I could cite some examples like:

3.1) TopoIsomerase Polymerases Eukaryotic Specific Spliceosome Proteins

The fact that Proteins Families form nested hierarchies is not an explanation of the mechanistic avenues to the formation of proteins families that have no common ancestor between the family nor does it explain the origin of things like TopoIsomerase (and its component ""-ases"" like AtpAse and Gyrase, etc.) nor polymerases.

If you can't explain this, then the theory of universal common descent is, ""we don't know how it evolved, but we BELIEVE it, we profess faith without explanation.""

4) Futhermore the organismal APPROXIMATE nested hierarchy can be defined even better with Taxnomically Restricted Features/Genes, not just protein phylogenies. Taxonomically Restricted Featrues/Genes are evidence against common descent proceeding from non-miraculous processes.",1,40,1541508017,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9unyh9/evidence_against_the_theory_of_universal_common/

DebateEvolution,9t8ge3,BRENNEJM,Evolutionist,t2_zea12,self.DebateEvolution,,r/DebateEvolution's infatuation with r/Creation,"*I understand this will probably be an unpopular opinion here, but it really needs to be said.*

I haven't been part of this sub for very long and in the short time I've been here I've seen some great posts and learned a lot. That being said, I really think r/DebateEvolution has a weird infatuation with r/Creation. I completely understand that creationism is the main ""opponent"" of evolution and, as such, it is an important topic (and fun topic) of debate in an evolution subreddit. I don't understand, though, why r/DebateEvolution users feel the need to post about r/Creation users here or ""drag them"" into posts here.

[A post here](https://new.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9pw1cl/debate_evolution_subscribers_targeting_yecs/) recently x-posted from r/Creation mentioned that users of r/Creation were being tagged in r/DebateEvolution posts simply for those users beliefs. I completely understand how annoying it can be at r/Creation if you want to post but are not allowed to due to strict/unfair rules. That doesn't mean we can tag others in posts here just so that we can debate them here. If those users want to debate here, they will post here. It's like overhearing someone at another table talking about something you don't agree with and yelling at them to join your table, just so you can shoot down their beliefs. (I'm all for shooting down beliefs, but the other person has to join the discussion willingly.)

I also realize that just because a user was tagged doesn't mean they have to join the conversation. I feel like this sub should conduct itself with more civility than Twitter though. Let's not just yell at other people in the hopes that we annoy them enough to join our conversation. (If that user has posted their beliefs here in the past though, have at it.)

In a [very recent post here](https://new.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9t68mq/rcreation_sectarian_crisis_are_days_in_genesis_i/) two users of r/Creation were called out for no reason at all. At least in that last post, users were tagged in regards to a topic somewhat evolutionary in nature. The thesis of this most recent post is literally, ""Hey Everyone! I brought the show to watch if you brought the popcorn!"" Maybe if the post offered evidence against the idea of the Genesis creation matching with the timeline of evolution, it would be on topic for this sub (but even then, there's no reason to directly tag the r/Creation users). In it's current form, it's just a gossip post; the only topic of discussion being the two r/Creation users who were tagged.

This goes against **Rule #2** of this sub: ""All posts must contain a clearly arguable claim."" There is nothing to debate in the post. There is no idea posited.

It also kind of goes against **Rule #3**: ""We are here to debate evolution, not religion."" As it stands, the only thing that mentions evolution are the posts linked to over at r/Creation. There is no new information or debate topic provided.

Sorry for the rant everyone. I was just so happy when I found this sub, but this infatuation with r/Creation and it's users really needs to stop.",1,88,1541070481,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9t8ge3/rdebateevolutions_infatuation_with_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,9t68mq,Dzugavili,,t2_bsswb,self.DebateEvolution,Question,/r/Creation Sectarian Crisis: Are Days in Genesis I Literal?,"I love it when two groups fight over their differing interpretations of the same invisible friend. Today, I give you a sparring match between of /r/creation's finest champions:

The days of creation cannot be interpreted as long periods of time](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9sy1nv/the_days_of_creation_cannot_be_interpreted_as/) by /u/Kanbei85

[The days of creation CANNOT be interpreted as ordinary 24 hour days](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9t35al/the_days_of_creation_cannot_be_interpreted_as/) by /u/Mike_Enders

Let's take a moment to talk about the contenders.

In the white trunks is /u/Kanbei85, a more recent arrival to /r/creation based on my limited and now legally hazy memory. My recollection is that he is a very idealistic Christian, a classic literal creationist, prone to [meltdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9p8cky/assuming_mainstream_science_and_society_at_all/e7zsgc7/) not entirely dissimilar to those seen from /u/stcordova, and [trying to evangelize](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9hprui/comparing_christian_and_vedic_creationism/e6ejuqv/). I'd say I'm insulted that he's not trying to save my soul, but I'm pretty sure I'd have a better time downstairs anyway.

In the black trunks is /u/Mike_Enders, probably the most abrasive of /r/creation's residents -- to the point of even picking this fight. Honestly, I'm susprised he's still there -- but he probably won't be soon enough, as I recall this recent thread [where he broke the echo chamber.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9oo1l6/mammals_cannot_evolve_fast_enough_to_escape/) Yeah, I read it -- I just stepped back to watch the carnage. He seems to come from an *Old Earth, Young Life* background

I encourage you to read both to get a general sense of their arguments, but the short forms as follows: Kanbei argues that God can do whatever he wants and that days are defined by periods of light and dark. Since light was made first, Earth just has to spin to define a day. Enders argues even the days are supernatural and thus could represent any amount of time, as God is creating the forces of nature itself.

Honestly, I just love seeing them go after each other for a change. What I find interesting though is that very few are arguing *against* Enders. His comments are nearly empty. Meanwhile, Kanbei's is pretty much a circlejerk:

&gt;The greatest Biblical evidence in favor of a literal creation week is the Sabbath of the 4th commandment.

&gt;Regarding Mike Enders: I do not know him personally. I do not know him well enough to even know if he is a true 'brother in Christ' or a wolf in sheep's clothing.

I think /u/Mike_Enders actually summed up the entire creationist industry pretty concisely:

&gt;You compromise the word of God to teach your own traditions.

There has to be a coordinated effort that focuses on the vilification coming from religious groups that claim to be scientific entity.

Doing nothing leads to this next becoming reality: 

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/first-thing-we-do-lets-kill-all-the-experts/

US academics seriously are being turned into the next targets while Trump/Pence go on like it's OK for them to be on the record for going along with a fraud that misrepresented what ""scientists"" have been all along saying. Here is an excellent (takes at least this long to cover) 17 minute correction of what vice president Pence (last I know) still represents:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikax0Y0NJsY

What is needed is organized and directed pressure for Trump/Pence into publicly retracting this conspiracy theory filled scientific disgrace that makes their message doubly dangerous to society. If they cannot then willingness to continue support hoaxes is an issue pertaining to religion compromised ability to be truthful. I would consider it a treatable mental health related issue where addiction to superiority feelings from religion creates rock-bottom bound monsters who are not afraid to deceptively take others down with them. That's when logic and reason fails, and need to treat this as religion justified criminal mindedness allowing continued vilification of ""scientists"" they are supposed to be fairly representing. Their fitness to lead will then be further in question.

Another decade of explaining the same things over and over again will only wear you out, even more. But forcing the Trump/Pence administration to get real in regards to regards to ""evolution"" and ""evolutionary theory"" would be a breakthrough. It's not asking them for anything hard, just have to get it right this time. Should be the easiest thing they had to do all month. It would much change at least my opinion of them. Getting otherwise kinda caught red handed willfully aiding a corrupt effort to make US scientists targets too would aid efforts to have both removed from office even though it has to be a one after another process, not at the same time. 

If this sounds worth a try to you then please suggest a way to get this on their agenda or whatever. My thoughts were to write a fancy letter with ribbon or seal to help make it look as important as it is, but those with Twitter accounts might more easily tweet a short agreed upon request we carefully write in this thread so that it clearly asks for the right thing.

{optional read below, obligatory ID related disclaimer where some likely already saw links and are used to the routine so can skip the rest} 

Forum regulars are most likely able to endure my dedication to getting the Theory of Intelligent Design with my name on it through this crisis. But they already know that it is based on (since 1979) beginner level self-learning machine intelligence robotics applied to modeling of intelligent and unintelligent cellular and coded molecular behaviors where which is can be easily seen by how many of the four basic features are required to model a given entity. If it has a memory that from hedonic/confidence level sensed mistakes learns successful actions that make it increasingly complex over time then all four are included. Water molecules have no such memory or hedonic/confidence system or takes guesses, atomic behavior makes all water molecules the same, unintelligent. It gives Mike Pence a way to honestly say at least the Theory of Intelligent Design worked out as planned. Only catch is that it's the kind of thing young high school level scientists most love, like digitally creating the closest thing to a living thing as computational methods allow, not misinformation used for bashing another theory, like Mike Pence is used to. 

Best place to learn details is now this forum, where what it contains for a wider message gets explained by what it makes possible for me to say to someone like Tim Stout in regards to their way of through science discovering how an/our intelligent creator works. I can be with him in regards to such a thing being possible, but being scientifically real requires being able to survive hard to please scientific audiences like in this forum. Most of the time they in my opinion do an excellent job answering questions best left to them to answer anyway. I'm best at cognitive science related issues that are invoked whenever ""intelligent"" behavior is mentioned or assumed. Path ultimately leads to educational material like at the worth respect Numenta open source forum, not institute that fights ""materialists"" instead of developing scientific ID related theory like they said they would:
 
https://discourse.numenta.org/t/oscillatory-thousand-brains-minds-eye-for-htm/3726                    

The most ID related part of my mission was there no issue either:

https://discourse.numenta.org/t/intelligence-and-transfer-learning/3894/7

Even though I am willing to for sake of science theory go this far with ID it's necessary for me to make it clear that I in no way endorse the actions of the DI, UD, Ken Ham and others. Being able to embrace the science world is replaced by the need to fight reason. Time to say enough is enough, and demand an end to that fraud and its bullying before the situation gets more out of control.

DebateEvolution,9qmnxt,timstout45,,t2_29ebkcx1,self.DebateEvolution,,A Natural Origin-of-Life: Every Hypothetical Step Appears Thwarted by Abiogenetic Randomization,"Over the years I have read many journal articles on abiogenesis.  Those in the field readily admit to its problems. For  instance Steve Benner said that over the past sixty years tens of thousands of articles \[in science journals\] in abiogenesis have been written, all claiming successful solution of some part of the problem, yet the problems remain \[doi: 10.1007/s11084-014-9379-0 \]. 

A few weeks ago I co-authored and posted to preprint an article at  r/https://osf.io/p5nw3  an article which hypothesizes a simple reason for the persistent lack of success in abiogenesis despite years of intense effort. In short, prebiotic processes consistently randomize their substrate. Life requires the exact opposite, the appearance of very high concentrations of specific chemicals spatially and temporally. As a result of this discrepancy, not a single experiment has yielded product which represents an advancement towards life and can then be used as produced in a subsequent step. Occasionally, useful products will be made. However, the prevalence of the randomly appearing ones overwhelms the usefulness of the desired ones and thwarts progress. 

For instance, one would never use the products of Millers experiment as substrate for an experiment on polymer production. Increased time does not improve the chance of success, it only leads to greater randomness. As an example, the Murchison meteorite plausibly has several million different isomers of C, N, O, H, P, and S. It has yielded a near-random sequence of the possibilities \[ do: i/10.1073/pnas.0912157107\]. It plausibly started with high concentrations of a few feed stock molecules not too awfully far removed from amino acids. Eventually, nearly complete randomization resulted. 

It is implausible that the process would ever reverse, where one would start with near-complete randomization and have random processes proceed to give a high concentration of amino acids.  Imagine a random walk in a large city with millions of intersections. Each intersection represents a potential isomer of the above six elements. Almost all of the intersections are characterized by several people located at them. Each person goes an an independent random walk. How realistic would it be to expect most of the millions of people distributed randomly among millions of intersections to all end up simultaneously at 28 specific intersections? These 28  intersections would represent the 20 canonical amino acids, four RNAs, and four DNAs used in life. 

To carry the illustration further, suppose that all of the millions of people started at one of four to six intersections located relatively close to the 28 desired ones. The desire is to have most of the people  end up simultaneously at the specified 28 locations. This represents a successful initial step of abiogenesis. After a very long period of time the distribution pattern is not the desired concentration at the 28 locations, but instead shows nearly complete randomization across millions of different locations. This would represent the Murchison meteorite. How plausible would it be to expect further random walks to eventually converge at the desired 28 locations? Because of the statistical law of large numbers, momentary fluctuations towards abnormally high distributions at any given  location will quickly be overwhelmed by a return to randomness. realitically, the desired focus representing life will never appear. 

I believe that qualitatively this represents the situation with Murchison. Even if the model were to be refined, perhaps by allowing jumps between intersections not just movement between adjacent intersections, or perhaps by allowing certain people at various differing intersections to join together in accordance with a set of specified rules and then allowing the combination to reach certain otherwise forbidden intersections, the refinement does nothing to overcome the effects of randomness. It only more accurately models the actual behavior of the organic substance of the meteorite. The important thing is that random changes lead away from what is needed, not towards it. There is no statistical basis to believe that a steady supply of the 28 canonical  molecules could be sustained for an extended period of time with such a model. Yet, abiogenesis would require this. 

I further believe that observed science has given all kinds of reasons to recognize that abiogenesis is impossible. The article posted at [osf.io](https://osf.io) mentioned above shows how randomness plausibly applies to the products  yielded by any and every proposed step of abiogenesis. One can apply the hypothesis presented in the article and qualitatively predict the results of any proposed prebiotic experiment. The process at work will randomize substrate and  naturally lead away from supply of the molecular products needed. This will apply to all steps; indeed, historically it has already done so for the reputedly thousands of already performed experiments.

Successful abiogenesis is going to need to show how random processes can overcome the effects of randomness. They can't. The fact that they can't is why no true progress has taken place in the field for the past 60 plus years. I suggest that the mentality that believes this is possible parallels the mentality of someone who thinks he has found a betting scheme to win at an unrigged, honest roulette wheel in a casino. The casinos love such people.

""If humans evolved from monkeys then how come there's still monkeys.""

""Well first off we didn't evolve from monkeys, we just have a common ancestor with them...""

So I've been reading about phylogenetics to better understand evolution recently. In doing so I came across the ideas of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly, [this diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png/640px-Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png) quickly shows what they mean. 

Now paraphyly includes the common ancestors of the groups that are paraphyletic. Everything I have found has shown me that Old and New world monkeys are both in the paraphyletic groupings of ""monkeys"" which includes their common ancestor with one another. However the common ancestor between these groups is also **our** common ancestor with these groups (as we are as closely related to New World monkeys as Old World monkeys are to them.) So surely this means we do have a monkey ancestor that we evolved from? Obviously it's important to make the distinction that we didn't evolve from any modern species of monkeys, but we surely did evolve from a primitive species of monkey.

Atomic theory in and of itself does not describe the historical conditions of nucleosynthesis of the isotopes, but it may or may not explain the supposed daughter products.  It also doesn't prevent faulty measurements and assumptions.

There are electric models of isotope nucleosythesis which I discussed and which you rudely dismissed when I brought it up.

DebateEvolution,9phd8b,Diligent_Nose,I sniff rocks for a living.,t2_4c608,self.DebateEvolution,,A question for the YECs.,"Atomic theory has given us many tools: nuclear energy, nuclear medicine, the atomic bomb, super powered microscopes, and the list goes on. This theory is based on 'observational science'.  Atomic theory is also used radiometric dating (Eg. U-Pb and K-ar). It stands to reason that if we have a good enough handle on atomic theory to inject a radioactive dye into a patient, we can use the same theory to date old stuff within a decent margin of error. (We can discuss this at more length, but it’s not really in the scope of the question)  This of course is based on the principle of [uniformitarianism]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism#Methodological_assumptions). If you don’t believe in uniformitarianism I would strongly suggest your time would be much better spent rallying against nuclear power plants than debating evolution on the internet as never know when the natural laws are going to change and a nuclear plant could meltdown or bomb spontaneously explode. 

Assuming there are no objections so far how do you logically account for the multiple mass extinctions events (End Ordovician, Late Devonian, End Permian, End Triassic, K-T) when there is only one biblical flood?

More generally, I'm wondering how easy, in a hypothetical universe where common descent is false, it would be to prove that through phylogenetic tree conflicts.

My instinct is that it would be trivially easy -- find low-probability agreements between clades in features that are demonstrably derived as opposed to inherited from their LCA. Barring LGT (itself a falsifiable hypothesis), there would be no way of explaining that under an evolutionary model, right?

DebateEvolution,9nrxwl,ArchMichaelWeb,,t2_140wrfw9,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"Omphalos/Five minutes hypothesis, Last Thursdayism － Irrational?!","Let's discuss what I consider to be the most sound creationist argument ever made. In fact, I would probably have accepted scientific picture in general and common descent in particular if not for this idea.

As you probably know, the hypothesis states that our universe appeared N time units ago in certain 'mature' state with further transition to its current condition by means of established natural laws we see today. Variations include YEC with its 6000 years, B. Russel's five minutes old universe, and a parody known as Last Thursdayism.

Now let' analyze this idea and define its properties.

As a hypothesis, Omphalos idea:

1. Is logically valid and self-consistent;
2. Does NOT contradict contemporary objective facts &amp; scientific findings. Moreover, it would tolerate ANY future data and evidence as well;
3. Does NOT violate fundamental scientific principles of naturalism (generalized form says nothing about supernatural forces like deities) and uniformitarianism (does not require non-stable natural laws or rates).

As a creationist argument, Omphalos idea:

1. Is NOT based on ignorance, misunderstanding or intentional misinterpretation of evolutionary biology by the likes of why-are-there-still-monkeys or what-are-odds-of-abiogenesis stuff;
2. Does NOT involve conspiracy theories;
3. Reconciles Biblical literalism with contemporary scientific evidence;
4. Is virtually irrefutable.

Objections to the hypothesis that I DO understand:

1. Being unfalsifiable, it is not scientific. Well, total agreement here: yep, it is not. But hey, it is not supposed to be and is not presented as such. It is a philosophical argument. Neitheir should it replace scientific theories nor represent some kind of alternative view in science classes. 

BTW, it seems that science guys may just reconsider falsifability requirement for scientific theories in future. 

Also, think of psychoanalysis. Looks pretty unfalsifiable as well, yet it works for millions of people!

2. It violates Occam's razor. Well, I would like to argue here. 

Omphalos hypothesis:

－ What constitutes contemporary or 6000 years old universe? 
－ Space, time, matter and energy. 
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Scientific worldview:

－ What constitutes pre-Big Bang singularity?
－ Space, time, matter and energy. 
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Same line of reasoning for evolutionary biology:

Omphalos hypothesis:

－ What constitutes Earth's biosphere?
－ A set of living creatures of numerous species.
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Scientific worldview:

－ What constitutes Earth's biosphere?
－ A set of living creatures of few species including Universal Common Ancestor.
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Why the hell does Omphalos explanation involve more entities or complexity?!

Objections to the hypothesis that I DO NOT understand:

1. That weird assumption of from-simplest-to-complex/from-chaos-to-order. What the heck? Why so? Why is it better/more rational/more practical than vice versa or from-complex-to-complex/from-one-order-to-another?

2. Counterarguments from ethics like those of deceiptful God/God's motives. These remind me of equally irrelevant creationist claims like 'if evolution is true, then morality is bullshit and life has no purpose or meaning'.

First of all, how can our limited intelligence comprehend God's motives much less judge Him?

Secondly, God didn't give revelations about common descent or Big Bang along with six-days Genesis story. These scientific theories came from humanity. They represent observer's inference so what the heck does it have to deal with God's honesty?!

Last but not least, God created mature Adam, right? Then it is fairly self-consistent to assume Him creating other things mature as well, including trees with rings, light from stars near to Earth already, and sufficiently diverse biosphere with highly developed species.

Almost all reactions/responses I've seen so far were either 'This idea is completely stupid/irrational', or 'Creationists using this argument are completely stupid/irrational', or both. At the same time one can calmly or even respectfully respond to rather silly and countlessly refuted creationist claims like 2nd law of thermodynamics, why are there still monkeys etc.

I am pretty much convinced of Omphalos hypothesis being perfectly reasonable and rational, logically valid and self-consistent. After seeing countless creationist claims with corresponding refutations from evolutionists, I came to the conclusion that Omphalos is the strongest and the most sound creationist argument.

It's been a while since I've visited here. Hope you're all doing well.

DebateEvolution,9l8hn7,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com on Genetic Entropy,"For the last few days this sub has been talking about a particular rebuttal to genetic entropy: The claim that if genetic entropy was real faster breeding organisms like viruses and bacteria should have significantly higher amounts of genetic entropy.

This is actually a specific argument I've made before. And at that time I received exactly one notable response (in a field of crickets). That response was a link to this CMI article, responding to that exact argument:

https://creation.com/genetic-entropy-and-simple-organisms

But first, I'd like to address another CMI article on genetic entropy:

https://creation.com/evidence-for-genetic-entropy

I've highlighted a few points, because they will become relevant later.

&gt;Second, despite pervasive and demonstrable natural selection among these viruses, the 1918 version of the human H1N1 virus went extinct, twice, at the appearance of a competing strain, apparently due to a lack of robustness caused by mutation accumulation. 

So the author is saying that the H1N1 virus went extinct due to genetic entropy, over a span of less than a century. This is important, because if genetic entropy can render a virus extinct in less than a century, what chance does a virus lineage have of surviving 6,000 years?

&gt; Lastly, since the various mutations accumulated in a linear fashion, **those mutations that escaped the selective filter (that would be most of the mutations)** apparently accumulated according to the laws of chemistry. 

So the author is saying that most of the mutations to this virus were not effected by selection. After all, that is the crux of the genetic entropy argument: that bad mutations accumulate and eventually damage the organism beyond the point of no return.

Now let's move on to the former article: Genetic Entropy and Simple Organisms.

'Genetic Entropy and Simple Organisms' was published in October 2012. 'Evidence for Genetic Entropy' was published in 2014. But, it is based on a paper published in October 2012. Also, and this part is very important, The 2012 paper, 2012 article, and 2014 article are all written by the *same person*, one Robert Carter.

Here's how Carter responds to the lack of genetic entropy in simple organisms:

&gt; For eukaryotic organisms (everything more complex than bacteria), the complexity of the genome makes the ‘mutation target’ quite large—in these more-complicated systems, there are more things that can go wrong, i.e. more machinery that can be broken.

[This is the citation given for that claim](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080596). Note that it doesn't actually say anything about harmful mutations being less common in bacteria.

That claim is really just a creationist assumption. Creationists assume that life is immaculately engineered, and that complexity can only be destroyed by mutations. Thus, the more complex something is, the more damage mutations will cause. But do we actually observe this in real life? I don't know, but I'm going to guess the answer is a resounding ""not really"".

&gt; On the other hand, changes to simpler genomes will often have more of a profound effect. Changing one letter out of the three billion letters in the human genome is not likely to create a radical difference. But the genome of the bacterium E. coli, for example, is about 1,000 times smaller than that of humans; bacteria are more specialized and perform fewer functions. Any letter change is more likely to do something that natural selection can ‘see’.

Hang on a second, wasn't this same person saying that most mutations went under the natural selection radar in viruses? Everything Carter says about bacteria is also true for viruses, many times more so. Viruses have even smaller genomes, and are even more specialized. Sounds like creationists want to have their cake and eat it.

&gt; First, bacteria do suffer from GE. In fact, and perhaps counter intuitively, this is what allows them to specialize quickly.3 Many have become resistant to antibiotics4 and at least one has managed to pick up the ability to digest non-natural, man-made nylon.5 This is only possible with much ‘genetic experimentation’, mostly through mutation, but sometimes through the wholesale swapping of working genes from one species to another. Many mutations plus many generations gives lots of time for lots of genetic experiments. In fact, we have many examples, including those just mentioned, where breaking a perfectly good working system allows a new trait to develop.6 Recently, it was discovered that oceanic bacteria tend to lose genes for vital functions as long as other species of bacteria are living in the area. Here we have an example of multiple species losing working genes but surviving because they are supported by the metabolic excretions of other species.7 Since the changes are one-way and downhill, this is another form of GE.

So they're saying that if a bacterium mutates to become better, that's genetic entropy. And if a bacterium mutates to become worse, that's also genetic entropy...Yep, they really do want to have their cake and eat it.

&gt; Another reason why bacteria still exist is that they have a lower overall mutation rate. The mutation rate in E. coli has been estimated to be about 1 in 10–10, or one mutation for every 10 billion letters copied.8 Compare this to the size of the E. coli genome (about 4.2 million letters) and you can see that mutation is rare per cell. Now compare this statistic to the estimated rate of mutation per newborn human baby (about 100 new mutations per child2) and one can begin to see the problem. Thus, there are nearly always non-mutated bacteria around, enabling the species to survive. However, there are also always mutated bacteria present, so the species are able to explore new ecological niches (although most known examples have arisen at the expense of long-term survival).

This may be true, but should a lower mutation rate really effect genetic entropy that much? Genetic entropy is supposed to be about mutations that go under the radar of selection. That should occur whether mutations are frequent or not. But regardless of the rates of mutation of specific bacteria, what about other organisms that don't have the same low mutation rate?

&gt; Bacteria can replace themselves after a population crash in a very short period of time. This is a key reason they do not suffer extinction. Thus, when exposed to antibiotics, for example, the few resistant cells within the population can grow into a large replacement population in short order, even though 99.99% of the original bacteria may have died.

This is of course true. But, wouldn't this also be true for all organisms, just much slower? If genetic entropy got so bad that humans started to die off, wouldn't the organisms without that fatal genetic entropy just repopulate the vacuum?

&gt; One might reply, “But mice have genomes about the size of the human genome and have much shorter generation times. Why do we not see evidence of GE in them?” Actually, we do. The common house mouse, Mus musculus, has much more genetic diversity than people do, including a huge range of chromosomal differences from one sub-population to the next. They are certainly experiencing GE.

Now this is actually a very important part of the argument. You might be able to come up with a bunch of excuses for why genetic entropy doesn't occur in bacteria or viruses, but what about something like mice? Surely every excuse you could make for bacteria wouldn't apply to mice. Their genome is roughly the same size as our's. They're the same class. So surely they would have hundreds of times more genetic entropy than us?

Well, Robert Carter says ""they are certainly experiencing GE""...without a citation, or even an example to back it up. I guess we're just supposed to take their word for it?

By the way, this is a common pattern you see in creationist articles, like those from CMI. They will often hand wave arguments with similar vague assurances that they're right. ""this rock/fossil/mutation is most certainly better explained by a global flood/not a transitional/a loss of information"". After all, you must remember that these people are paid to say that creationism's right, even if all they have to back that up is a baseless assertion that they're right.

And remember, the whole issue is that these organisms breed hundreds, thousands, even millions of times faster than us. I say this to pre-empt any creationist who thinks they might have proven their point by showing mice have 15% higher risk of genetic disease, or something along those lines. These organisms should have literally hundreds of times as much genetic entropy as us, not just tiny slithers more. And yet, that isn't what we observe.

So, the only logical conclusions are that genetic entropy either doesn't occur, or that there are natural mechanisms that prevent genetic entropy from accumulating past a certain point, or some combination of the two. Most likely the last one. ",1,122,1538625264,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9l8hn7/creationcom_on_genetic_entropy/

The user /u/ThurneysenHavets says:

&gt; Now it so happens that creation.com, AIG and other websites have published a range of articles within my own domain. They are, to put it mildly, really bad. And I need to admit that this biases me against anything else produced by these creationist organisations (who are, after all, the most prominent representative of the creationist movement).

&gt; To be brief, the articles in question would in my eyes deserve to be failed if written by a first-year linguistics student. They misunderstand the most basic concepts, they ignore swathes of relevant research, and they leave out key information in ways I find very hard to believe was accidental. I did a brief rundown of a single example on r/badlinguistics some time ago, and despite the fact that it was written by someone with credentials in the field, its wrongness is by no means unrepresentative.

&gt; To be clear, I’m not trying to ""bash"" creationism generally here, and I also fully understand that these articles are not important to the main thrust of the creationist argument, which pertains to biological evolution or the lack thereof. I’d just be interested to hear this sub’s view on the fact that these articles exist at all (assuming you accept my judgement on that point, which you are of course free not to, although you can't really address my question in the latter case).

&gt; My question is this: do you think it’s reasonable of me to assume that an organisation which produces nonsense in other fields, which I do understand, isn’t going to be accurate in matters of biology and geology, which I understand much less? Or would you expect anyone to keep an “open mind” with regard to the biological argument, no matter the known unreliability of these same organisations elsewhere?

To answer: They're bad in all subjects. Those organizations aren't there for original research or digging into the facts of the Bible or their religion. They're there to take what other people are working on, and seeing how they can fit that work to their conclusion.

Most of the time, they do this through similar dishonest tactics. Quote mining, misrepresentation, ignoring huge amounts of evidence contradicting their conclusion, etc.

Those who are more knowledgeable in a subject and are at least a bit intellectually honest can see how bad creationist sites like those misrepresent that subject to fit their mythical beliefs.",1,33,1538534735,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9kx9tk/a_nonbiologist_creationist_on_rcreation_discovers/

But I want to highlight something /u/guyinachair said here, because it's not just an important point; it's a *direct* refutation of ""genetic entropy"" as a thing that can happen. Here is the important line:

&gt;I think Sanford claims basically every mutation is slightly harmful so there's no escape.

&gt;Except you get **populations of fast reproducing organisms which have surely experienced every possible mutation, many times over and still show no signs of genetic entropy**.

Emphasis mine. 

To understand why this is so damning, let's briefly summarize the argument for genetic entropy: 

* Most mutations are harmful.

* There aren't enough beneficial mutations or strong enough selection to clear them.

* Therefore, harmful mutations accumulate, eventually causing extinction. 

This means that this process is inevitable. If you had every mutation possible, the bad would far outweigh the good, and the population would go extinct. 

But if you look at a population of, for example, RNA bacteriophages, you don't see any kind of terminal fitness decline. At all. As long as they have hosts, they just chug along. 

These viruses have tiny genomes (like, less than 10kb), and [super high mutation rates](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2323). It doesn't take a reasonably sized population all that much time to sample *every* possible mutation. (You can do the math if you want.) 

If Sanford is correct, those populations should go extinct. They have to. If on balance mutations *must* hurt fitness, than the presence of *every possible mutation* is the ballgame. 

But it isn't. It never is. Because Sanford is wrong, and viruses are a *direct* refutation of his claims. ",22,144,1538230158,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9jx1xp/direct_refutation_of_genetic_entropy_fastmutating/

You probably know the type of video. A fanatical christian and a student at a rally 'debating' something or another. I know I shouldn't waste my time with this, but I got curious.  
The script is familiar. The christian is trying to gotcha his opponent in a logical trap hoping this will convince anyone his answer must therefore be correct. In this case claiming you can't sense your senses or use logic to prove logic. Basically if your worldview is based on any assumption whatsoever, it must be wrong or 'you can't justify it'  
It is certainly true that it's a total assumption -as in an unprovable claim- that logic as we know it, is correct. What annoys me is that the rebuttal is that if only you start with God, the Supreme Law Giver blablabla... Right, only you need logic to even be able to distinguish between there being a God and there not being a God or there being one God or up to infinity Gods. This is conveniently ignored or he doesn't even realize his is subject to his own objection.  
I stopped watching when the fanatic starts talking about redemption because I can't stand that kind of proselytizing.

&gt;&gt;  So no one has done any calculations, including yourself. But you're apparently very certain that evolution would take ""obscenely long amounts of time,"" based on the calculations no one, including yourself, has ever done. Sorry, how exactly did you figure this all out? Also, billions and billions of years seems pretty like a pretty fucking huge amount of time to me, so I still don't understand what the problem is.

&gt; I haven't done precise calculations, but I have done some. You'd be surprised just how unlikely it is for a specific set of nucleotides to mutate in just the right way out of hundreds of not thousands of nucleotides within a genetic sequence. If we boil it down to extreme basics, assuming any non-drastic mutation chance (ie: somewhere between 30% and 70%), assuming that each mutation will always result in the desired nucleotide, and even assuming millions or billions of generations of organisms, the likelihood of even a relatively small change in genetic sequence is ridiculously low. If you would like to try it out for yourself, go ahead and assume a genetic sequence of 1500 base pairs, or 3000 nucleotides. Assume that 50 specific nucleotides must mutate and that the rest must remain the same. Pick whatever mutation chance you want and then try to calculate the likelihood of such a mutation taking place. Then after that multiply it by the number of generations and bam, you got your chance of mutation given said number of generations.

________________

Mueller published his famous paper, Our Load of Mutations, in 1950. Since then there has been a growing realization that any type of population can potentially undergo mutational meltdown, given the right circumstances. Indeed, it is widely believed that the human race may presently be in error catastrophe. I have been studying this problem for roughly 18 years. The simple logic of genetic degeneration is summarized in the book Genetic Entropy (Sanford. J.C. 2014. Genetic Entropy. Fourth edition. FMS Publications. Waterloo, NY).

In 2005, my colleagues and I developed the numerical simulation Mendel’s Accountant, which simulates the mutation/selection process in a manner that can be comprehensive and biologically realistic. We have used this genetic tool to better understand how deleterious, near-neutral, and beneficial mutations accumulate over time, and how these mutations affect population fitness. When given any parameter settings that are even remotely reasonable, we consistently see that deleterious mutation count per individual increases linearly, while fitness decreases either linearly or as a smooth downward decay curve (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). The steadily increasing deleterious mutation count and the resulting fitness decline are primarily due to the fact that most non-neutral mutations have very slight fitness effects (i.e., they are near neutral), so they tend to be essentially invisible to natural selection. This problem grows much more acute when mutation rates approach one or more mutations per individual per generation. When this happens, such mutations accumulate faster than selection can possibly remove them, greatly accelerating genetic loss and resulting in error catastrophe. Our simulations show that it is surprisingly difficult to stop the continuous accumulation of deleterious mutations, and it is surprisingly difficult to amplify enough beneficial mutations so as to achieve any net gain in population fitness. Our studies indicate that these theoretical concerns are most acute in man, but are also very serious in other higher organisms that are diploid and have long generation times. These theoretical problems appear to even apply to certain bacteria and viruses.

We did simulations of bacteria and virus, to investigate if these organisms might possibly also be subject to net genetic loss by modeling E.coli-like bacterium and an influenza-like virus (Brewer, W.; Smith, F. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Information loss: potential for accelerating natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses ,In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (369-384)). In both cases we saw systematic net genetic loss. We then analyzed the real-world mutation accumulation pattern in the famous LTEE E. coli project, and the historical mutation accumulation in the H1N1 human strain of the influenza virus. Our results show that in the bacterial LTEE project, all of the documented “beneficial” mutations were reductive in nature, involving loss-of-function. This even applied to the citrate-uptake promoter mutation – which involved the loss of a regulatory function. This means that even while the E coli strains were adapting to the artificial in vitro conditions, the strains’ total functionality (as applicable to variable natural environments), was declining (i.e., reductive evolution) https://www.logosra.org/lenski. Likewise, we showed that the human H1N1 influenza strain had a perfectly linear rate of mutation accumulation over the last 100 years, such that 100f the genome was mutated. This linear accumulation was accompanied by a smooth and continuous decline in virulence, until the human H1N1 strain went “extinct” in 2009 (i.e., disappeared from the influenza database) (Carter R.C. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2012).  A new look at an old virus: patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling 9:42doi:10.1186/1742-4682-9-42).  

Do beneficial mutations out-weigh the effect of deleterious mutations? We have studied various systems to understand some of the limitations of beneficial mutations. It is well documented that beneficial mutations are very rare, and this should be obvious. However, beneficial mutations are problematic for many other reasons. First, we used simulations to show that the large majority of beneficial mutations should be nearly-neutral and so cannot be selectively amplified (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). Second, our simulations confirm “Haldane’s Dilemma” and also “Haldane’s Ratchet” (simultaneous selection for even a modest number of beneficial mutations requires deep time, yet that amount of time causes a vastly larger number of nearly-neutral deleterious mutations to go to fixation). Lastly, our simulations show that when a beneficial function cannot be selectively favored until a string of two or more specific mutations arises, the waiting times can become extremely prohibitive (Sanford, J., Brewer, W., Smith F., and Baumgardner, J. 2015. The Waiting Time Problem in a Model Hominin Population. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling12:18).

It has been widely claimed that Fisher’s Theorem proves that as long as there is genetic variation in a population, fitness will always increase. We have shown mathematically that Fisher’s formulation was in error, and we have corrected his formulation. With this correction, the math indicates that net gain in fitness is very problematic – as is consistent with our numerical simulations (Basener, W., Sanford J. 2017. The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection with Mutations. Journal of Mathematical Biology. Volume 76, Issue 7, pp 1589–1622).

The Avida program is a simulation that shows net genetic gain. However, we have shown that Avida’s net gain requires that its beneficial mutations are assigned extremely unrealistic fitness effects (every beneficial mutation will double fitness). When realistic fitness effects are applied, there is always a fitness loss, converging to zero (Nelson, C.W. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2011). The Effects of Low-Impact Mutations in Digital Organisms. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, Vol. 8, (April 2011), p. 9., Nelson, C.; &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Computational evolution experiments reveal a net loss of genetic information despite selection, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (338-368)). Perhaps the most famous beneficial mutation is the NylB frameshift mutation. We have shown that this famous beneficial mutation actually never happened and that the NylB protein is not a novel protein, but is a widely distributed enzyme that has been present for a long time http://vixra.org/abs/1708.0370  

Two hypothetical solutions to the problem of continuous net degeneration have been proposed. These possible solutions are the synergistic epistasis mechanism and the mutation count mechanism. We tested both of these mechanisms using numerical simulations. Even using the most generous settings, the synergistic epistasis mechanism accelerated genetic decline and led to rapid extinction (Baumgardner J.; Brewer, W.; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Synergistic Epistasis Halt Mutation Accumulation? Results from Numerical Simulation, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (312-337)). Likewise, when we tested the mutation count mechanism, the fitness declined rapidly - except under highly artificial circumstances (i.e., where all mutations had an equal effect - which allowed mutations to stop accumulating) (Brewer, W.; Baumgardner, J. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Using Numerical Simulation to Test the “Mutation-Count” Hypothesis, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp 298-311)).

The theoretical problem of continuous deleterious mutation accumulation has been acknowledged by most leading population geneticists ever since Muller published his paper in 1950. The greatest concern is the possible degeneration of the human population, which may result from both genetic and epigenetic mutations. I suggest that investigation into methods to reduce human mutation rates is highly warranted.

\[This paper is a pretty cool experiment\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632803](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632803)) I'm reading about in grad school that uses selective pressure in a really neat way. Basically, these scientists take RNA molecules that have a 90-nucleotide sequence generated at random. Then they put the RNA through a trial, which in this experiment is catalyzing a reaction that transfers a biotin to itself. The RNA molecules unable to catalyze the reaction are lost. But the RNAs capable of transferring the biotin survive and are replicated.

The RNAs that survived are then amplified, and run through another 10 rounds of selection then amplification. Sequences of the RNAs at the end of the experiment were 90% conserved, indicating that there was a single common ancestor. Oh, and during rounds 6 and 7, they used a PCR amplification that induced mutations in the RNA, with no ill effect on the kinetics of the RNA's catalytic ability. The rest of the paper demonstrates the kinetic properties of these RNAs. 

Idk, but I'm pretty sure this paper basically punches a hole in many Creationist arguments. Here's why: 

1) it demonstrates that RNA is capable of catalyzing reactions

2) it demonstrates that random sequences of RNA can generate reactions which can in turn be selected for

3) it shows that mutations can be beneficial

4) it demonstrates a plausible mode of evolution of random peptide formation. Once you get random peptides, you can do the exact type of selection this paper's experiment does, except with peptides instead of RNA. 

The major critique that I would anticipate from a creationist, if they actually knew anything about biochem, is that there are two steps in the experiment that require enzymes that already exist. One during the conversion of the selected for RNA to cDNA, and the other during PCR amplification. This paper is about the selection for a reaction analogous to amide bond formation. There are other papers, for example \[Highly Efficient Self-Replicating RNA Enzymes\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943892/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943892/)) that demonstrate RNA can replicate itself.

I hadn't heard it before reading [this post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9i5l82/what_is_your_opinion_that_creationistscreation/e6h41y7/) I found it in a couple of ""[papers](https://creation.com/baranomes-and-the-design-of-life)"" from...wait for it...creation.com, dating from late 2008, but haven't found anything from before then in the few minutes I've been looking.

## [Different Approach to Problem of Orphan and TRG genes/proteins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9i05ej/different_approach_to_problem_of_orphan_and_trg/)

📷 

\[**advanced topic in biophyiscs/molecular biology/structural biology**\]

An orphan gene is a gene found only in a species and an TRG (taxonomically restricted gene) is a gene found only in a group of species.  This is problematic for arguing universal common ancestry since it means some proteins have no traceable ancestor, possibly even in principle.  

A Darwinist will say, ""well it has an ancestor, we just don't know what it is.""  To which I'll say, ""if you don't know, why don't you just admit you don't know, and instead say, you only BELIEVE it has an ancestor in the absence of evidence. And furthermore, it shows how useless it is to BELIEVE it has a common ancestor as far REAL science is concerned where observable facts take priority over beliefs without evidence.""

Most of what I'm about to say floats over the head of most Evolutionary Biologists I've encountered.  Since I studied evolutionary biology at the graduate level, I know how to play their game, but more importantly I'm learning how to beat them at their own game. Evolutionary biologists don't usually have the background and logic skills to see problems in their own theories.

Don't be put off by the technical jargon you are about to see, just look at the following two pictures at the end of this OP.

Evolutionary biology is based a lot on cherry picking data and avoiding really hard questions.  

In the following two diagrams, you'll see little colored boxed which highlight major functional components of proteins. You'll see the protein Topoisomerase 2A has a totally different set of functional components than a family of proteins called KRAB ZNF proteins.

I posed this question over at [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate) evolution, and I got no answers:

&gt;""According to evolutionary theory, did all proteins descend from a single ancestral protein?""  
 

Well, it's understandable I got no responses since its obviously difficult to argue all proteins descended from a universal common ancestor protein, and assuming it did, the assumption is utterly useless since all one really needs to do REAL biology (vs. speculating on useless evolutionary stories) is to note ""similar things behave in similar ways, and those that aren't similar don't""  Like, DUH!  You don't need the assumption of Universal Common Ancestry (UCA) to see that, just an assumption of common pattern, common architecture, dare I say,  common DESIGN!

Anyway, let the reader see whether insistence on Universal Common Ancestry will help you understand protein architecture:

DebateEvolution,9h8fm5,Diligent_Nose,Geologist,t2_4c608,self.DebateEvolution,,"Darwinist Hypocrisy About The Quality and Value of Their Beliefs to Society, a very brief review.","Once again, /u/stcordova has felt the need to retreat to a safe space.

Here’s a quick and dirty 10 min review of his stuff.


&gt;So I asked some Darwinists what would count as evidence of a Creator God. One said, ""nothing"" at the DiscussEvolution Discord server. That was an honest answer. Kudos for honesty.
&gt;Some other Darwinists punted and didn't give an answer, another said, ""I don't know in advance what would count as evidence, it's impossible to know what would be positive evidence for creation."" So that's an admission he doesn't know even in principle what would be evidence of creation! He admitted he accepted evolution based on FAITH, not formal proof.
&gt;Regarding creation and ID, at least I said, I don't think there is DIRECT evidence, maybe formal proof is impossible.

I’ve love to hear what the indirect evidence for a creation model is, I’ve never heard of one that rivals the completeness of evolution.  Most of the time people say they’re supporting creationism when they only are only attacking evolution.  Show up with a concrete model and I guarantee people will pay attention. 

&gt;Many of the Darwinists will say, ""creationists don't believe in evolution because they are scientifically illiterate, they believe in some imaginary being. They have no DIRECT evidence. Time to grow up.""

Snark aside, you have no DIRECT evidence for a deity.

&gt;But let's turn the tables. They don't have direct evidence either!! In physics, for example, we can repeat the measurement of gravitational acceleration near the Earth's surface. That is a repeatable experiment.
&gt;In contrast evolutionists can't give direct evidence that a giraffe and a tree descended from some ancestor, let us call it ""great great....grandma."" So what did ""great great...grandma"" physically look like, and why is it reasonable that a tree and giraffe could descend from ""great great...grandma."" A giraffe has a heart, it has legs, it can walk, see, hear, taste and smell. A tree? Well it can't do that because it's a tree.

You’re right, to the best of my knowledge evolutionary biologists can’t.  How does that invalidate evolution? Theories aren’t complete, or perfect, they only describe what we can observe to the best of our ability. Assuming you could come up with a smoking gun to disprove evolution, that by no means validates creationism.

&gt;So I point out to them, they don't know how evolution actually worked, they only guess. 

No, people not true. Look no further than labs that study antibiotics and drug resistance, and GMO crops to explore two fields that depend on evolutionary theory. Are you arguing they’re just throwing shit in a petri dish and getting lucky?

&gt;They can't demonstrate from actual principles of physics and chemistry nor from experiment that a giraffe and a tree could in fact descend from a common ancestor. They can't demonstrate from physics and chemistry that natural selection will work as claimed. 

See above.

&gt;I point out to them the net average result of natural selection is LOSS or DESTRUCTION of function, not construction of function. So if the net direction of evolution is toward simplicity (reductive evolution), then how did complexity evolve. The only place the net direction of natural selection is toward more complexity is in the imagination of evolutionists, not in DIRECT lab and field observations.

Oh great, ‘genetic entropy’ again, not my area, but others here who have studied that material have discussed why it’s bunk at length.

&gt;They are left in the unfortunate position of describing changes that in sum total look miraculous. Ah they irony, a theory that claims to be natural needs the equivalent of supernatural miracles to rescue it. 

I do believe you’re getting the sides confused. I don’t see anything in the theory of evolution that requires the supernatural. 

&gt;So their evidence is lousy, so bad that even a renowned evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne said, 
&gt;&gt;In science's pecking order, evolutionary biology lurks somewhere near the bottom, far closer to [the pseudo science of] phrenology than to physics.

If you’d read the next paragraphs you’d see he was referring to evolutionary phycology as behavior, unlike bones do not fossilize. Bring him in to explain to you why evolution is as robust as theories come, I’m sure he’ll be very pleased you’re quote mining him. 

&gt;At least three regular participants here a r/creation have physics degrees (myself included). 

Great, so people that hold degrees here are fine, but people across the row that hold degrees don’t know what their talking about.  Got it.

&gt;Relative to the major theories of physics, evolutionary biology has no direct e
experiments, only silly claims based on what they advertise as relevant experiments. 

[Demonstrably false.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9gnlpi/why_is_there_still_a_debate_when_evolution_is/e66utye/)

&gt;They point to antibiotic resistance and Galopagos finch birds, etc. Well, the problem is these experiments could just as well be interpreted to show there are limits to evolution. 

Moving the goal posts? When does evolution become not ok?  Be specific, don’t bring up ‘kinds’ without a very specific definition.

&gt;No matter how much selection pressure and mutation is applied, a bacteria remains a bacteria, it would appear it would take a miracle for the bacteria to become a Eukaryote like a human. Apply enough selection pressure on a population of birds, and it won't turn into some other creature, most likely the selection pressure will kill it. In fact species of birds are going extinct at an alarming rate. Selection is a powerful destroyer of species, it is not a good originator!

We have very good evidence for Dinos &gt; birds, land mammals to whales, and we know Skate genes work in Mice embryos, this is just off the top of my head, I’m sure there are many others.

&gt;One can't, to paraphrase physicist Fred Hoyle, evolve a potato into a rabbit.

Literally no one is arguing that we can.
&gt;Further, the claim of universal common ancestry is worthless to operational science. Evolutionists will say, ""well we're able to use lab rats to study humans because of the belief of common descent."" 

I don’t know about you, but I really, really like GMOs and pharmaceuticals. 

&gt;Unfortunately for them, creationists were the pioneers of comparative anatomy. Creationist Richard Owen (who was critical of Darwin), was the one who coined the word ""homology"" that was based on the observed common design in creatures. 

According to Owen’s [Wikipedia page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen#cite_note-Amundson2007-5) he was a critic of Darwin

&gt;“Owen agreed with Darwin that evolution occurred, but thought it was more complex than outlined in Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[4] Owen's approach to evolution can be seen as having anticipated the issues that have gained greater attention with the recent emergence of evolutionary developmental biology.[5]“

Stop spreading lies. 
&gt;Owen like others claimed something that is designed one way is unlikely to evolve to another design. That's why something designed to be a fish won't ever give rise to a bird, it will on give rise to other fish!

Something we agree on, notice how humans, whales, bats, and platypus are all mammals?  My daughter is also a mammal.

&gt;Also, it was creationist Edward Blyth who actually put forward the ideas of indefinite radiation and natural selection (ideas which Darwin plagiarized, distorted and gave no appropriate credit to Blyth). 
[See this book by the Provost of an Ivy League School: https://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Mysterious-Mr-Evolutionists-Harvest/dp/0156239493]

I haven’t read this book, and don’t have time to look for a review currently, but I suspect if it held much water, the authors argument wouldn’t be tucked away in a 37 year old book I can buy for the price of a cup of coffee. 
 
&gt;So the quality of Darwinist beliefs in Universal Common Ancestry lacks direct evidence, and its value to science is next to nothing. Yet they insist one is illiterate if one doesn't agree with their professions of faith. And Darwinism is FAITH, it is not, compared to theories in physics and chemistry, real science.

Again, no, there is lots of evidence, and as per usual, you’ve only attacked, poorly I may add the theory of evolution without providing any evidence for a theory that better explains our observations.

I urge you to read [this paper]( http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/5330/cleland01-historical_science.pdf) on the validity of historical science.

I recently stumbled on a thread in /r/Creation that was overlooked.

Titled: [**I have a friend who claims that “there are no credible scientists who don’t agree with evolution”**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9b60ry/i_have_a_friend_who_claims_that_there_are_no/e51yr0f/?context=1).

I recommend reading the whole thread and especially the top comment to understand how the discussion started. The discussion channels into the usual topic. Mainly what causes so many scientists to not be creationists? The topic then further channels into the question of peer-review and peer-pressure.

So far so good? Then let us observe the discussion. Since I have linked to it, you guys can read the full discussion and I will highlight some of the more interesting points.


___

/u/lisper:

&gt;&gt;Any scientist must agree with the majority of scientists or his work will not pass peer review.

&gt;No, that's not true. What is true is that if you disagree with established theories you need some damned good evidence and arguments to back up your claims. Also, you need to at the very least understand the established theories. One of the problems with Creationists is that they spend a lot of effort attacking straw men (""You grandpappy was a monkey"") so they have kind of worn out their welcome as scientific dissenters.

/u/Mike_Enders:

&gt;The ""your granddaddy was a monkey"" stereotype is just more unfounded bias. We are talking here about peer reviewed publication. There is zero evidence any creationist scientist ever offered any such kind of paper.


/u/lisper:

&gt;No, it's an argument that I have seen creationists advance in the past.

&gt;In fact, here is a page from the Institute for Creation Research:

&gt;http://www.icr.org/article/charles-darwin-man-behind-monkey

&gt;The headline is ""Charles Darwin: The Man Behind the Monkey.""


/u/Mike_Enders:

Again those are just media sites. You continue to misrepresent.

&gt;Like I said your same argument can be made on the other side.

&gt;And yet I do not try to paint those who submit to peer reviewed science as responsible for Dawkin's rhetoric in his books. I can make the same bogus argument you are making.

&gt;So to be valid you need to stop with that fallacious conflation. Of course several creationist sites talk about God and scripture just as several atheists sites talk about evolution and atheism.


/u/lisper then asks a **simple question**:
 
&gt;**Who would you hold forth as the best representatives of the creationist position?** Because AFAICT, ICR and AIG seem to be the intellectual leaders, and they both appeal heavily to religion.


/u/Mike_Enders

&gt;Why do we need to appeal to anyone? You just claimed facts are what matters. Consensus arguments are not good proxies. They are just lazy skip the data arguments.

&gt; Your argument makes little sense.

/u/lisper:
 

&gt;&gt;Why do we need to appeal to anyone?

&gt;I didn't say we did. I just said that ICR and AIG do.

&gt;&gt;Your argument makes little sense.

&gt;What argument? I was not advancing an argument, I was asking a question: **who would you cite as the best representatives of the creationist position?**

___

In my opinion, the following comment from /u/Mike_Enders then quickly lets the entire discussion fall apart:

___


/u/Mike_Enders:

&gt;I have little taste for rank dishonesty.

/u/lisper:

&gt;&gt;I have little taste for rank dishonesty.

&gt;Well, that's one thing we can agree on.


I the following comments, /u/Mike_Enders vocabulary features a lot of the following snippets:


&gt; what are you like 9 years old?

&gt; So much for your honesty.

&gt; typical atheists

&gt; Lol.....such a liar

&gt; No time for games kid - I'm grown. Bye

&gt; ROFL..still such a liar

&gt; Never agreed with you either liar

&gt; I have no need to answer your question

&gt; Sorry kid. 

&gt; I stopped taking anything you say or ask seriously


However, redditor /u/lisper rakes up whatever effort he has left and tries to bundle up his arguments again:

/u/lisper 

&gt; &gt; You ARE begging for me to accept your premise

&gt; Nope.  Just asking respectfully for an answer to a simple question: what would you point to as a good source for creationist arguments?

&gt; The way real science is done is that someone advances a hypothesis, checks to see that it is consistent with the available data, and then makes a testable prediction against which an experiment can be performed.  So I invite you to consider the following hypothesis: what if the creationist position really is bankrupt?  What if the answer to my question is that there is no answer?  What testable predictions wold this theory make?  How would we expect a creationist to react when asked to point to a source of material on creationism that does not invoke the authority of scripture?

&gt; Well, one thing that we might expect is for them to get defensive, to start levying false charges against the person asking the question, and basically to do anything they can to obfuscate the fact that they are avoiding answering the question because in fact it has no answer.

&gt; Just something to think about.
    

/u/Mike_Enders

&gt;**I have no idea what you said in that wall of text because I was too bored by your lying to give you the respect of reading it. Just stopped right there.**


&gt;However you have proven once again the tendency for atheists to have very low morality so thanks for that at least.

___


Hmm okay. The impression is left to the reader with no commentary coming from me. I have two comments to insert at this point:

1. Why is it difficult to name a creationists organization that is representative to the creationist movement? Is this a threatening question somehow? To me at least, almost every creationist shows a preference to a certain website. So why is it so difficult to name one?

2. I am particularly interested about one specific part that /u/Mike_Enders mentioned:

&gt;Dawkins is a great popularizer of atheism and evolution. In his books which millions of his fans approve of he makes many strawman arguments....MANY.

A) Which books is he talking about specifically, excluding God Delusion?

B) What exactly would be examples of strawmen that he uses?

I am hoping for a civil and calm discussion, whoever chooses to participate or just spectate.

Thank you and have a nice evening! Be civil!

DebateEvolution,9gmasp,Diligent_Nose,Geologist,t2_4c608,self.DebateEvolution,,Learning the lessons of Mount St Helens Reviewed,"/u/Kanbie85 recently challenged me to ‘Get yourself out of this echo chamber and check out some educated creationists like those over at icr.org or creation.com. This followed a discussion where I regrettably did not put as much effort into the discussion as I should have.


I asked Kanbie85 to suggest an article, first he suggested genetic entropy, but as I’m not a geneticist (and that has been discussed at length very recently) I asked for a geology based paper. He suggested [Learning the lessons of Mount St Helens](https://creation.com/lessons-from-mount-st-helens).  Here is a line by line break down of the article:

 

&gt;It was not until I visited Mount St Helens volcano in Washington State, USA, that I fully appreciated the immensity of its 1980 explosion. Over many years, I had learned a lot about the eruption, watching videos, listening to lectures, and reading reports. When the mountain blew up physically, it also blew away many false ideas about geology, ideas that were wrong, but had been believed for more than a century.

I’ve started boiling my potatoes before roasting them, the outside is crispier than before, and I have been getting rave reviews on my method of baking potatoes. I must have been wrong about everything I knew about cooking before.  Science becomes stronger as it tests hypothesis with new information, this is a feature, not a bug.

&gt;After decades of inactivity, Mount St Helens coughed to life in March 1980, some two months before its explosive eruption. Its smoke and rumbling were warning that something big was building up. Officials set up an exclusion zone around the volcano based on scientists’ ideas about how an eruption would occur. However, the blast was larger than expected, plus it first erupted sideways to the north instead of vertically. Of the 57 people that died, all but three were outside the exclusion zone.Wrong geological ideas can be deadly.

I’m sure those geologists who set up the exclusion zone feel horrible that people died. Before throwing rocks at ‘wrong geology’ let’s dive into the meat of the article.

&gt;Wrong geological ideas have also led people to wrong ideas about the Bible—that the events it describes were mythological and did not actually happen. Mount St Helens changed that, which is why I have been so interested in what happened. The eruption demonstrated that geologic catastrophe can produce in hours and days geologic features previously believed to have taken millions of years. When we see what the volcano did in such a short time, we can better appreciate how the catastrophe of Noah’s Flood formed the much larger geological features on planet Earth.

I’m not convinced that studying volcanism is analogous to understanding flooding, I assume the article will enlighten us.

&gt;For many years, geologist Dr Steven Austin researched the geological effects of the Mount St Helens eruption and its aftermath. He published extensively on how that catastrophe sheds light on the global catastrophe of Noah’s Flood, which is a key to confirming the Bible’s truth.1

Great, Steve Austin is a [legit geologist]( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/credentials.html), hopefully we can get to some actual data soon.

&gt;One of the many surprising results was an 8 m (25 ft) thick sedimentary deposit exposed in a cliff alongside the North Fork Toutle River (figure 4). It is composed of finely-layered sediment (figure 5). From eyewitness reports, photographs, and monitoring equipment, it is known that this whole deposit formed in just three hours, from 9 pm to midnight on 12 June 1980.1 It was deposited from black clouds of fine, hot ash mixed with gas, blasting at high speed from the volcano—a pyroclastic flow. Ash-laden and heavier than air, the flow surged down the side of the volcano and along the river valley at more than 160 km/hr (100 mph), hugging the ground and depositing ash.

First, we have a ‘sedimentary deposit’ of pyroclastic flow. [Pyroclastic flows are volcaniclastic]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_rock), not sedimentary. I’m not sure why this article failed to get basic terminology right.


The only reason geologists would be surprised that a 25m thick could be deposited rapidly is if they hadn’t been keeping up with the research [this]( http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(78)90003-3) 1978 paper (I’m going to only use papers from before 1980) discusses a 3-4 metre thick deposit that formed in 90 minutes during the eruption of the Ngauruhoe volcano in 1975.  There are many more examples of pyroclastic flows in the literature, but I wanted to use an article that had the time deposition took to be included to drive my point home. Steve Austin seemingly failed at reading the literature before heading to this study area, good use of limited field time there Austin^/s

&gt;The big surprise was that the sediment deposited in fine layers called laminae. You would expect a catastrophic, high speed ash flow to churn the fine particles and form a uniform, well-mixed deposit. Thus, it had been conventionally thought that fine layers had to accumulate very slowly one upon the other over hundreds of years. But Mount St Helens showed that the coarse and fine material automatically separated into thin, distinct bands, demonstrating that such deposits can form very quickly from fast flowing fluids (liquids and gases). Since then, laboratory experiments have shown that fine laminae also form quickly from flowing water.2 This shows how finely-layered sandstone deposits in other situations, such as some of the lower layers in the Grand Canyon,1 likely formed rapidly, which could have happened within the time-scale of Noah’s Flood.

Again, [this]( http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(79)90008-8) 1979 paper discusses laminae in pyroclastic surge flows. Geologist knew laminae could form during pyroclastic surges.

The basal formation of the [Grand Canyon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Grand_Canyon_area#Vishnu_Basement_Rocks) is composed of metamorphic rocks, not volcaniclastic rocks, so no, we cannot draw a comparison.

&gt;The Mount St Helens eruption also demonstrated how canyons can be formed much faster and in a different manner than conventionally thought. Ongoing eruptions eroded the thick sediment dumped at the base of the volcano, producing multiple channels and canyons. One such channel was dubbed ‘Little Grand Canyon’ (figure 6), being about 1/40th the size of Grand Canyon.1 Its side walls were up to 40 m (140 ft) high, its width up to 45 m (150 ft), and a small stream of water ran through it. Someone coming across that canyon could easily conclude that it was eroded slowly and gradually by the small creek now running through it, over many hundreds or thousands of years.


Where is the ‘little grand canyon’ on the [map]( https://dl0.creation.com/articles/p119/c11976/Mt-St-Helens-map-lge.jpg) of the study area? The fact that the eruption eroded material that was deposited earlier in the eruption is not the same as quickly removing lithified rock.  I can mix up cement, and quickly dig it up before it lithifies, once it sets though, it’s a lot harder.

&gt; However, the formation of this canyon was documented. It was carved by a mudflow caused after a small eruption of Mount St Helens melted snow within the crater on 19 March 1982. The mud built up behind debris, burst through it, and cut the canyon in a single day. So, the creek did not cause the canyon. The canyon caused the creek.

See above.

&gt; Two other canyons on the flanks of the volcano provide more dramatic evidence of how canyons can be eroded quickly. Loowit Canyon, which is over 30 m (100 ft) deep, was gouged in part through old, hard volcanic rock called andesite (figure 7). Again, it could be supposed that the streams entering the canyon by a waterfall eroded it over thousands of years. However, mudflows eroded the canyon in a few months in the second half of 1980. It is still being eroded, but nowhere near as quickly as it was during the major eruptions of the volcano. Step Canyon, to the west of Loowit Canyon, is even larger, over 600 ft deep. Mudflows draining the volcano’s crater also eroded this canyon in the same time period. Once again, the force of the mud cut through solid rock, including old, andesite lava flows.

According to the [USGS P28]( http://homepages.uc.edu/~maynarjb/MtStHelens/Gliken_1996_debris%20avalanche.pdf) the old andesite was a rubble unit from previous eruptions.  Again, I can move unlithifed material with a spade. A volcano is more powerful than I am.

&gt; The volcanic eruption, including the landslide, pushed rock down the mountainside and across the landscape. As the large rocks slid, they gouged grooves and scratches in the underlying rock (figure 8). It has been customary for geologists to interpret grooves on rocks as being formed by a glacier, as the ice and rocks creep across the landscape. However, this interpretation would be wrong for the grooves in rocks at Mount St Helens; they were gouged by fast-moving rocks propelled by geological catastrophe, not a slow-moving glacier. This means that many geological areas previously interpreted as glacial environments need to be re-assessed, because they may not be glacial at all.3

I agree, we should re-assess striations in rocks, when evidence of volcanism is nearby. I can drive a few hours and see plenty of evidence of glaciation, yet I’m a few days drive from the nearest volcano. With the last ice age being 10ka, I’d be very shocked if we’d missed the signs of a volcano that erupted that recently. I know a lot of farmers and non of them have found a volcanic rock in their fields. 

&gt; The magnificent pine forest surrounding Mount St Helens prior to the eruption supported a regional timber industry employing many people. The blast on 18 May, together with the landslide and subsequent mudflows, transformed the northern forested area into a vast, gray landscape (figure 3). In some places trees were destroyed up to 25 km (15 miles) from the volcano. They were stripped of branches and leaves, uprooted or snapped off, and knocked to the ground facing the direction of the blast.

Sure, it would suck to live near a volcano that erupts.

&gt;A small portion of the landslide on 18 May plunged into picturesque Spirit Lake, just north of the volcano. This hurtled an enormous wave across the lake and 260 m (860 feet) up the hillside opposite. As it rushed up the slope, the wave ripped out a million large pine trees and dragged them back into the lake. Initially, the surface was so tightly packed with floating logs that the water could not be seen. Log mats like this would have been common during Noah’s Flood as the forests growing in the pre-Flood world were ripped up by the destructive floodwaters.

First that's not evidence for a flood, secondly it put limitations on the depositional environment of the flood due to the high energy setting the article claims occurred with the flood.

&gt; The logs floating on Spirit Lake rubbed together and scraped off bark and remaining branches. This sank to the bottom of the lake forming an organic layer of peat, suggesting a mechanism for how coal deposits could have formed during Noah’s Flood.

Without showing the chemistry of a peat bog turning into coal in 6000 year or whatever the time frame is, this quote is meaningless. [Here]( https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coal/) is a very basic overview on the formation of coal deposits. [Here](http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.43.3.207) is a more in depth look, although I’m sure that paper is fairly out of date. Until a model the rapid change from peat to coal is introduced, we can the last sentence.

&gt;Surprisingly, as the logs became water-logged they tipped on their ends and floated vertically (figure 9). Eventually they sank to the bottom with their heavy root-end penetrating the sediment and peat layers there. The initial sediment deposited in the lake raised its floor by some 90 m (300 ft), and further sediments were deposited in the subsequent months and years. As more logs sank they formed a ‘forest’ of vertical logs with their roots buried in sediment at different levels on the bottom (figure 10). If someone saw this but did not know how it formed, then they might think multiple forests had grown in place and been successively buried. But such an interpretation would be wrong. The vertical ‘trees’ at the bottom of Spirit Lake were ripped up from one forest that was destroyed in one catastrophic event.

Ah, polystrate fossils, lets go back to [1868]( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html) to show how this can occur.

&gt; Trees were also engulfed by the landslide and carried kilometres down North Fork Toutle River. More than 30 years after the disaster, along the Hummocks Trail I saw many tree trunks still protruding from the ground. In the past, geologists routinely said vertical tree trunks entombed in sediment were buried where they were growing.4 That is what the interpretive signs at Specimen Ridge in Yellowstone Park used to say about the multiple layers of vertical tree trunks exposed there—that the forests grew and were buried multiple times over many tens of thousands of years. This time-frame clearly contradicted the biblical one. However, Mount St Helens has changed that thinking and the signs have been removed from Yellowstone. Geologists now know that trees can be transported into place by volcanic catastrophes and left sitting vertically, as we saw at Mount St Helens.

See above.

&gt; The devastating eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 showed a lot about the effects of geological catastrophe. Features that geologists have traditionally thought needed long periods of time to form formed very quickly, within hours, days and weeks.

Nope, we’ve shown that’s false, geologists have long known thick beds can from rapidly.

&gt; Yet, by volcanic standards, even in historic times, the Mount St Helens blast was relatively small, ejecting some 1 km3 (0.2 cubic miles) of ash. The eruption of Vesuvius in ad 79 was three times larger, Krakatoa in 1883 was 18 times bigger, and Tambora in 1815 was 80 times larger. The volume of lava in the Deccan Traps in India is some 5 million times more. These indicate that volcanic eruptions during Noah’s Flood were millions of times larger. When we consider the true immensity of the biblical cataclysm, and how it impacted the whole earth, Mount St Helens helps us envisage how Noah’s Flood explains the geology of the world, and how it happened so quickly.

And when Jellystone goes off, it’s gonna make all those look like childs play. Of course when we examine a larger time frame there will be larger volcanic events, stating that fact does not provide evidence for global flooding.

&gt; Once we realize that the Bible is not mythological but records true events in history, we can approach its message with a new mindset. Then we are open to make new discoveries about our world and our place in it.


This article has done nothing to support that claim. Furthermore this sentence along with the creation.com mission statement: To support the effective proclamation of the Gospel by providing credible answers that affirm the reliability of the Bible, in particular its Genesis history, shows, that only evidence that supports the Bible is admissible

Ok, there we have it. Assuming that’s the top quality work of creation.com I won’t be repeating this exercise, and I assume it is at least average quality if not higher as it was recommended to me.  I’ll leave the K-Ar dating for another day (maybe), let me know if I missed anything, Kanbie85, I know you’ll be the first to let me know if I got something wrong, I look forward to hearing about it. I did get a bit lazy at the end, but when damn near every paragraph had major problems with it, going over this article became depressing, I had hoped debunking a cherry picked article would have at least been a bit challenging.

&amp;nbsp;

Almost all the atheists I have encountered online survive by a number of fallacious memes and outright contradictions which are easy to deconstruct (but they will have none of it because they are not particularly honest).

""God of the gaps""

This one I see even theists and apologists buying but if falls apart by another proposition ( which is actually  true) that atheists often make - ""Science is provisional"". They usually state this when something is shown to be false  that they previously adhered to.  The whole sentence goes something like this -

""Science is provisional.  We go with the best explanations we have at the time. Self correction by evidence is what makes science what it is"".

The contradiction with the God of the gaps counter is easy to see when we think about  it.  In Science we go with the best explanation we have based on the state of evidence  at the time.  We don't invoke imaginary evidence of what will be found at a later date.  Though there are fallacious - we don't understand it so God exist arguments - its nevertheless part of science to go with the explanation that best suits the present facts.   Atheists turn this on its head dishonestly when the facts  line up with a best explanation being a logical force in nature - then they argue  science  explanations should not be based on the  evidence we have at this time.  Science magically then is no longer provisional  and we should await an imaginary discovery of evidence that will change the best explanation we have now .

""Atheism is just a lack of belief"" or ""I just don't believe""

This one is just dishonest and/or ignorant to its core.   No system of belief  is ""just""  a single proposition.  I don't believe the earth is flat for   a number of reasons not ""just a lack of belief in the earth being flat"".   Every atheist I have read and debated over two decades has a positive belief in naturalism. If you disbelieve in something widely held  (or even not widely held) its because you have  a positive belief in something else  - whether that's  in your education, your personal anecdotal experience or because it contradicts some other previously held position - you don't ""just"" disbelieve.

""Argument from incredulity""

This is a master of of a psychological ploy crafted to rebut basic mathematical probabilities. If something is improbable and you point it out  the rebuttal is that the improbability does not need to be answered  because citing the improbabilities is an argument from incredulity.  The contradiction that is apparent is that the standard is completely flipped when atheists use their ""incredulity"" that a loving God would do this or allow that. Its also flipped by atheists when as they say ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"".  In that case quite often extraordinary is really just their ""incredulity"".  They can't imagine a God or that naturalism isn't the ultimate explanation for reality..

Thats just a few fallacies and contradictions atheist use online and of course the ""God did it"" meme which is just a lie since almost all sciences were established by theists who never stated ""God did it"" .  Besides which everything else but ""God did it"" is acceptable as they readily show when thought experiments (else where known as pure imagination) are advanced as scientific answers to improbabilities.

I no longer take online atheists seriously (particularly those with obvious psychological issue hanging out in theist sections - How long would you hang out in an online community with people who believed in Santa and elves? Yet thats pretty much what the CLAIM to see in theists).  Offline I've met a few thoughtful atheists. Not one online.  


&gt; Now, to be fair, my characterization of what he said is paraphrased.  If  you want to ask him yourself what he actually said and believes, I  should give him the opportunity to speak for himself. So you can talk to  him here.  If you do, you have to do it in the ""thunderdome"" section,  otherwise he threatens to ban you if you discuss it in the ""general""  section. 

Sounds as productive as  watching paint dry.


&amp;nbsp;

A couple comments for the kind of responses you will get to your OP  from atheist with special thanks to [u/Dataforge](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dataforge)

&gt;In that thread Sal, and a couple of other creationists, try to defend  the use of god of the gaps argument, saying they're not actually  fallacious. Which is of course absurdly wrong.

this is another classic Atheist tactic.  Change what was said and attack the strawman then do a victory dance (preferably where a lot of other atheists hang out so there is insulation).   NO one ever stated all god of the gaps arguments are wrong. In fact I took pains to say exactly the opposite. There are some valid uses of it.  whats absurd is creating a strawman and then proclaiming the actual statement absurd but then that's the nature of strawman arguments isn't it? The point is  Atheist overuse and misuse the god of the gaps argument. They invoke it with no thought and they violate the fundamentals of the fallacy as long as  the word ""God"" is extracted whihc we all know is TOTALLY fallacious.

&gt;First of all, let's define exactly what a god of the gaps argument is.  As the name suggests, it's finding a gap in knowledge, and saying that  having that gap in knowledge means that a god must have been the cause.

and therein lies the issue.  any time you use a vague standard for one side and not another  it is by definition **Fallacious**. Saying we do not know  and because we don't know something - God exists **IS a valid accusation** of the God of the gaps argument. However in what area of science do we not have gaps of knowledge? none. Thats the whole idea of  science being provisional. So atheists often invoke God of the gaps when THEY cannot explain the logical implications of what we DO KNOW. as their get out of Jail free card.

Looking like no way out of the logic of theists? Stuff your defeat into  the fact that every area has things we do not know, claim your answer to theists is in that gap, but not discovered yet  and then invoke the God of the gap  defense. Voila!  you have avoided defeat for any and everything.

No apologies. G of G is a farce when so used. Because science is provisional we  make decisions based on  data that is there against  evidence that isn't there.  We do that in all areas of seeking facts and evidence. Atheists turn that on its head  only WHEN THE DATA IS NOT ON THEIR SIDE and then invoke the gaps we  have in all sciences as an excuse.

NO ONE of any significance in the creation side makes the argument - aha  ""gaps"" therefore  God there lurks. **Thats just lying for Dawkins.** Instead we make the logical argument that some things indicate logic/intelligence over random and little evidence is against that conclusion.   A classic example is abiogenesis. All the available evidence indicates at the moment that naturalism just isn't working as a solution.  concrete FACT.  We have been at it around 80 years and its gotten no better.

We are found guilty of  G of G because the data **does show** naturalism hasn't worked, that life is incredibly complex and thus  is more likely not  a ""designoid"" but  the perfectly rational alternative - designed.  It talks like  a design. It rationally looks like a design so it is rational to consider the possibility it is a design - the only  response of the atheists is  - we will find out later its not designed just  trust us - if you don't - Aha God of the gaps!

another classic use of fallacious use of god of the gaps accusations? I'll keep is short because this post is long enough. I don't think I have found an online atheist yet  who when backed into a corner doesn't bend all logic and rationality to avoid a supernatural beginning to reality. the logic is solid and the evidence is overwhelming.

How many times have I heard from atheists that there may in fact be a solution to  nature creating itself naturally (along with hilarious claims that quantum fields are not the very nature that existed previously  in order to create itself)? countless and when I ask them for such a possible solution they say they don't know  but not accepting their totally empty  imagination of the future discoveries of science is  a - you guessed it - God of the gaps argument.

So yes G of G arguments as used by atheists are  often based on imagination, are fallacious and are  the TRULY absurd argument.   Creationist and theist need to be better at pushing back such an obvious fallacious argument. Its one of their key memes to back up a lack of evidence that has failed for 90% of the population in being convincing of atheism.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9ftu6q/evidence_against_evolution_common_descent_or/

In that thread Sal, and a couple of other creationists, try to defend the use of god of the gaps argument, saying they're not actually fallacious. Which is of course absurdly wrong.

First of all, let's define exactly what a god of the gaps argument is. As the name suggests, it's finding a gap in knowledge, and saying that having that gap in knowledge means that a god must have been the cause.

It's not the same thing as actual positive evidence. For example, Sal say's that if the Earth was proven to be young, that would be evidence for Biblical creation. And I agree. If we were able to prove that the Earth was 6,000 years old, that would be positive evidence. Because that's direct support of a claim.

One major problem that creationists have when forming these arguments is a massively inconsistent standard of knowledge. When it comes to evolution, or anything natural, they demand evidence, and a lot of it. You have to show a clear succession of fossils, with DNA evidence, and a full mutation by mutation pathway. Knowledge about evolution is only knowledge if it's absolute certainty.

But when it comes to their own beliefs their standards for evidence are...pretty much non-existent. They just say that God created it. That's really it. Just a claim, a series of words, is knowledge, according to them.

Make no mistake. Whenever you see a theist talk about something we don't know, they don't know either. They are not responding to a lack of certain knowledge and evidence with knowledge and evidence of their own. They are responding with a claim. And it's a very easy claim to make. Anyone can claim someone created something, but backing up that claim with evidence is a lot harder.

Now onto some of the actual claims from the creationists in that thread:

From /u/stcordova:

&gt; The reason I raised that hypothetical scenario is to show a paradox. For them to accept God as Creator, they might need a God-of-the-Gaps miracle to persuade them there is a Miracle Maker. They could appeal endlessly to some possible undiscovered entity or ""natural explanation"" to explain the miracle, but the problem for them is that if the miracle was actually REAL, their policy of appealing to some ""undiscovered natural mechanism"" would prevent them from ascenting to the truth. 

If we observed an actual miracle, that would not be God of the Gaps, depending on what said miracle was of course. That miracle would be positive evidence. And that's a very different thing to the God of the Gaps claims that creationists regularly make. Not knowing how life began is not the same thing as observing a miracle. Not knowing the mutation pathway of every complex biological feature is not the same thing as observing a miracle. Not knowing what every single DNA base does, and how every single amino acid effects the proteins it's part of is not he same thing as observing a miracle. You get the picture.

&gt; The problem of appealing to some yet-to-be-discovered explanation has relation to problems in math where Godel proved that there are truths that are formally unprovable but must be accepted on faith.

Not really. Faith is belief without regarding evidence or reason. And like it or not, it's perfectly fine to believe in something because it's a package deal with your other beliefs. You don't need evidence for each and every part of it just to say it's not faith based. I don't believe in gods. For a number of reasons, I believe this is not a faith based position, but an evidence and logic based one. Thus, the other logical conclusions that result from my atheism are also not faith based. I would grant theists the same concessions, by the way, if their beliefs were not based on faith.

&gt; I pointed out to OddJackdaw that his claims that abiogenesis and evolution are true are not based on direct observation, on validated chemical scenarios, but on FAITH acceptance in something unknown, unproven, unseen, likely unknowable, and inconsistent with known laws of physics and chemistry! 

That's the problem; abiogenesis isn't inconsistent with known laws of physics and chemistry. It's not something we know is wrong, or impossible. It's just something we don't know. And remember, as I said above, theists don't know either. They do not have a better explanation to replace that gap with.

From u/mike_enders:

&gt; In Science we go with the best explanation we have based on the state of evidence at the time. We don't invoke imaginary evidence of what will be found at a later date.

Remember what I said before: the creationist's claims are not better explanations. They don't have more evidence. They don't have demonstrated mechanisms. They're just empty claims. We don't need to invoke evidence that might be found, we just need to say that their explanations have much less evidence (or none what so ever).

From /u/nestergoesbowling:

&gt; when folks claim there must be some yet-to-be-discovered natural explanation. That observation resonates with something Matt Leisola discussed: Materialists think that because we continue to make discoveries about the natural world, the pool of known mysteries must be shrinking toward zero. Instead, whole landscapes of new mystery present themselves to science precisely when some major new discovery is achieved, like the explorer reaching the crest of a mountain and finding a new realm before him.

Though he's right about science constantly expanding its horizons, and with it the amount of unknown and undiscovered things, that's not a supportive argument for creationist claims. As of yet, exactly zero of these discoveries have been a religious supernatural answer. It's pretty obvious where that trend is going.

It's clear that the creationist gets very hopeful that with each new unknown field, they might finally find the piece of evidence that reverses that trend. Something that finally warrants a supernatural answer, instead of a natural one. That's why creationists, including Sal, spend so much time on molecular biology arguments. They stopped asking for pathways for wings and eyes, because we know enough about those things to give solid answers. But the function of each enzyme and protein is not known, and thus it's much easier to make an irreducible complexity argument in that field.

&gt; And the evidence for God is directly proportional to the ever-increasing size of those gaps

Let's do the maths on this one. The amount of evidence for the supernatural we have now is zero. Back when we knew less about the world the evidence was also zero. So the amount of evidence for God = Evidence x zero. Wow, he's right, it is directly proportional!

https://discord.gg/QsMpP9U

Chat is not the best forum for debate, so instead of calling it the *Debate* evolution discord, it is the *Discuss* evolution discord. The goal is that for the most part this will be focused on *polite* discussion rather than Creationists yelling at us all about how we are wrong. To achieve that, we have four channels:

* **General discussion:**  
Questions about evolution, as well as sincere, non-inflammatory questions about why we believe evolution instead of creationism. Generally unmoderated, but this is not the channel for creationist rants. *Overtly pro-creationist comments and ""[JAQing off](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions)"" in this channel may result in a ban.* Use the thunderdome channel for that sort of thing.
 
* **Evolution Lounge:**  
Invite only channel for people on the pro-evolution side. A place to vent about your frustrations dealing with the stupid arguments from the other side. You will automatically be added to this channel once we assume you are on our side. 

* **Creation Lounge**  
Same as above but for the creationists. Vent about what idiots the rest of us are. Just be aware that the admins can read the messages in this channel and we reserve the right to post them in the other channels if we want. Don't like that? Make your own server! We'll even tell you how to do so if you ask (It's really easy).

* **Thunderdome:**  
Open season. Creationists, post your ~~bad~~ best arguments and tell us why we are wrong. I'm sure you will convince us. Really. 

Some ways I would like to see this used:

* Writing a response to a post, but you are unsure about something? Post it and we'll try to help.
* Maybe we can have ""group watches"" of debates and lectures posted to youtube and discuss them. 
* Have a homework question on a related topic? We won't do your homework, but maybe we can help you understand. 
* And who knows what else. 

Right now this is just an experiment, but if it goes well, we'll see if the mods want to add it to the sidebar as a permanent feature.

**TL;DR** This brainiac chemist-computer scientist says that evolution is impossible because:

&gt;…I simply do not understand, chemically, how macroevolution could have happened. Hence, am I not free to join the ranks of the skeptical and to sign such a statement without reprisals from those that disagree with me? … Does anyone understand the chemical details behind macroevolution? If so, I would like to sit with that person and be taught, so I invite them to meet with me.

Admittedly, I'm stupid about this stuff and I don't really understand what the fuck this chemist is talking about. I have a very oversimplified understanding of biological evolution. The way I usually explain it is: *specimens born with mutations that are helpful to their survival survive and copulate such that the mutation becomes more widespread and the mutants outlive the disadvantaged ancestors.* I understand that mutations happen 1-2 DNA letters at a time, and I understand that a group of organisms can evolve so that they become more distant to their ancestors. Thus, I understand that a group of organisms can evolve so that they become biologically a different species from their ancestors--i.e. they can no longer reproduce with the initial gene pool. Am I missing something?

I did post here recently, and I received a lot of great advice, but my creationist parents are being kinda not rational about this. And they're telling me that I'm the one who's being obtuse and ridiculous. Nothing that I show them as evidence--ring species, fossils, various specimens developing entire different organs--matters to them because ""we've never observed a species turning into another species.""

I've tried to explain that macroevolution is the same as microevolution, and the only difference is the amount of time they occur across, but they'll insist that somehow micro and macro evolution are entirely different. And then today my mom pulled this thing out of her ass about how there are extra chemical changes involved for a species to gradually evolve into another species, and I...am completely lost.

DebateEvolution,9djzr9,zezemind,Evolutionary Biologist,t2_c4bcg77,self.DebateEvolution,,Polonium radiohalos in sandstone,"Anyone know about this claim of ""successful prediction"" by Andrew Snelling? (Relevant part in bold)

&gt;Uranium is an unstable radioactive element. In laboratories today, the most common form of uranium decays very slowly in a predictable way. During this “decay chain,” other fast-decaying elements, such as polonium, appear briefly—a blip on the radar, as it were.
As radioactive atoms decay, they shoot out millions of particles that damage the surrounding minerals. Since the particles shoot out in random directions, the radiation damage forms a sphere around the radioactive atoms. Viewed in cross section, the damage looks like a halo, which gives us the name “radioactive halo,” or radiohalo for short.
We find not just radiohalos made from uranium but other types of radiohalos nearby, including those formed by the decay of polonium. That’s a problem. Polonium, which forms by the decay of uranium, lasts only a short time before it’s gone. Yet the rock record reveals both uranium and polonium radiohalos near each other—frozen in time. How can polonium separate itself from the uranium before the polonium decays?
When radioactive polonium decays, it leaves circles of damage, known as a radiohalos. Since polonium is a short-lived product of uranium decay, it normally disappears without a trace. But Andrew Snelling predicted that the Flood produced unique conditions that allowed water to carry polonium away from the decaying uranium. As predicted, he found polonium radiohalos in rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains.
Snelling believed that special conditions during the Flood would explain this strange phenomenon in granites. (Granites form from magma as it rises near the earth’s surface and then cools.) If true, these conditions provide rock-solid evidence that many physical processes sped up during the Flood.
If large volumes of hot water seeped rapidly enough through uranium-bearing granite as it formed, then this water would carry the polonium away from the uranium before the polonium decayed.
The magma that originally formed the uranium-bearing granite was initially a scorching 1200–1330°F (650–705°C). Since radiohalos break down at temperatures above 302°F (150°C), the granite would have to cool within two weeks, not millions of years. Otherwise, we would not see radiohalos in the present.
In 2003, Snelling published his findings and proposed his model for the rapid water transport of polonium (see Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Creationism, pp. 243–267). In 2008 he continued to chip away at the problem and added the expectation of rapid cooling of the granite.
**He then went a step further and applied his model to another type of rock. In a 2008 paper, Snelling predicted that polonium radiohalos should also be found in certain sedimentary rocks that were transformed when the earth’s plates crashed together during the Flood. At the right pressure and temperature, chemical reactions would release enough water to transport polonium away from uranium. He predicted that radiohalos would be most frequent at this pressure and temperature, and decrease in frequency away from this point.**
**Later in 2008 Snelling identified a spot in the Great Smoky Mountains, near Cherokee, North Carolina, where colliding plates produced just the right conditions. Better yet, the sandstone there contained minerals that could preserve any radiohalos that had been produced. Additionally, the sandstone was thick enough to allow him to gather other samples a great distance away where conditions wouldn’t have been as favorable. When he extracted minerals and examined them under a microscope, the highest frequency of polonium radiohalos came from places where the earth’s collisions generated the greatest volume of water, as expected.**
**No one had predicted anything like this before because it did not fit conventional evolutionary assumptions. Confirmation of Snelling’s prediction not only verified his model for the rapid formation of polonium radiohalos, but it also indicated that the sandstones must have been changed (metamorphosed) within two weeks during the Flood, not over millions of years.**

The Jetsons was on tv,  and the space race was at its height, I suppose I’m simply showing my true colours: I’m a bit of a spacenerd, and I'm too young to remember the 'duck and cover' drills my parents endured.  During the same period, an very import discovery of earth systems was also made, a key piece of evidence for what is arguably the most important geological theory was discovered in the oceans inky depths.

Welcome to the second instalment of [The present is the key to the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9ckfpe/on_the_idiocracy_of_observational_vs_historical/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit). In the first instalment we looked at two ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconformity) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic) very basic pieces, and a third [more complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding) one that we very much glossed over as we briefly touched on why ‘historical vs observational science’ is to be charitable a misnomer. 

Today we’re going ~~dive~~ skim two pieces of evidence from very different disciplines of geology that apply to the theory of plate tectonics: Earth’s magnetosphere and palaeontology. 

Warfare has long been a driving force of invention.  The first half of this story is no different.  During the second world war tools to read changes in magnetism were used to [locate submarines](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/developing.html). These devices were altered and used to map the sea floor, as it was known that [basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt), a key part of the oceanic crust often contains [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite).

Much to the surprise of the researches, [the magnetic poles of the rock alternated between ‘normal’ or with the southern magnetic pole located at Earth's north pole, and the northern magnetic pole being near Earth's southern pole, and reversed, were the north magnetic pole is at the north pole of the earth, and the southern magnetic pole is near the south pole.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#Magnetic_poles). In order for a rock to be magnetized ([clearly, this is a simple explanation, because like ICP, I also don’t understand how magnets work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs)), the rock must first be hotter than its [Curie Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature#Materials_with_magnetic_moments_that_change_properties_at_the_Curie_temperature), once this happens the magnetic spins aligns with the earth’s magnetic field.  Once the mineral cools below it’s Currie temperature, that magnetic signature is locked in, giving us a glimpse into the history of earth’s magnetic field.  Rocks really do hold surprising secrets. 

Now leaving behind the mind destroying field of geophysics for a second, let’s actually look at what’s observable in the dirt without some fancy equipment. Palaeontologists have found fossilized [mesosaurus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosaurus#Distribution),  [Cynognathus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynognathus#Provenance), and [Lystrosaurus](Lystrosaurus) in both Africa and South America. As I’m sure someone is going to come up with some insane idea of how these animals would somehow make it across the ocean, or some other equally insane idea to explain this amazing fossil range, we’re going to identify one more fossil.  Glossopteris[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossopteris] is a plant, a fern to be exact.  It’s found in both Africa and South America, as well as India, Australia, and Antarctica. The seed of the Glossopteris is large, and therefor was not windblown great distances, or is likely to floated great distances. 

So we have two bits of evidence, first the zebra patterned magnetic ‘stripes’ on the oceanic crust, and secondly very similar fossil assemblages on either side of the Atlantic ocean. We also know there is the [Mid Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge), you can go see it for yourself in [Þingvellir Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Þingvellir), I’ve been fortunate enough to have been there twice, both times were equally amazing. This ridge creates new oceanic crust, widening the Atlantic ocean

Finally we have one more important tidbit of information, there is no [subduction zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) on the Eastern side of the Americas, nor on the Western side of Africa, so we know the sea floor spreading from the Mid Atlantic Ridge without anywhere to go. 

We’ve briefly gone over the evidence, and the links are there for anyone who wishes to dive deeper into any of the subject discussed.  I’ll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions of what historical events left these clues for us to find.

If I may be so bold, I’d like to recommend an episode of Sean Carroll’s Mindscape [Mike Brown on Killing Pluto and Replacing It with Planet 9](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/08/27/episode-11-mike-brown-on-killing-pluto-and-replacing-it-with-planet-9/) As a self identified space nerd it was great to go on a short tour of our solar system, before diving a bit deeper into what may be just out of sight. More importantly to this subreddit, the themes of the scientific methods ability to correct errors, the ability to admit ‘I was wrong, or I didn’t know’ and the fear of being ostracized for suggesting a claim that is counter to the momentum of the field are all discussed. 

Once again, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Constructive feedback of both the content and the writing is appreciated.

These arches are collapsing at an alarming rate; in Utah's Arches National Park, there are more than 2000 known arches... well, 2000 minus 43, which is the number that have collapsed between 1970 and 2015. Majestic \[wall arch\]([http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081000492.html](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081000492.html)), the then-11th largest arch in the park, totally collapsed during the night of August 4-5, 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

My family sent me this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdqYPjA9VxA&amp;t=191s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdqYPjA9VxA&amp;t=191s) . I can tell honestly by the title alone it's trash - it clickbaity and dishonest. Not only this, but there is a distinct lack of references. However, I simply don't know the science to refute the claims, which is why I need your help. I realise the video is around 30 mins long, which I doubt anyone can be bothered to watch, so I'll summarise the list of points and references they use to make it quicker and easier. It goes as follows:

1. Soft tissue in dinosaur bones which are 10s of millions of years old.

Mary Higby Schweitzer discovered dinosaur tissue by accidentally dissolving too much of the bone, this tissue is elastic. Being a fossil there should be nothing left. Finding tissue is expected to be only of modern bone (although they don't say how modern).  It also says that 'scientist Mark Armitage fired for making dinosaur soft tissue discovery' (I suppose implying that evolutionists are cult-ish and any counter evidence is bad/ignored). This poses radical challenge to the existing rules of science that tissue cannot survive even a million years. Examples they give are an 80 million year old duckbill, and a triceratops found in Montana. These are full of bone osteocytes. It shouldn't be able to remain present for millions of years surrounded by oxygen and water.

2. Carbon-14

If the Earth were one giant ball of c-14, in 1 million years, the entire ball would be gone. Yet 'they' are finding c-14 in dinosaur bones (don't know who 'they' is). Dinosaur bone is much smaller than the entire Earth to top it off. This proves that what you are testing is not very old (due to c-14's nature). Such a discovery implies that a dinosaur cannot be 68 million years old. Finding c-14 would suggest an age in the range of Egyptian mummies. At 7:32 in the video it shows a table (not giving any sources) about c-14 in dinosaur bones.

3. Amino acids in dinosaur egg shells

There are left handed amino acids in dinosaur egg shells, these, apparently shouldn't be here. They should be '50-50'. Moreover,10 dinosaurs from multiple different continents were c-14 tested at the world's leading labs, they then showed the results. The american geophysical union censored their paper (I'm not sure who, sorry). They did this because they claimed that they're getting measurable c-14 from dinosaur bones all over the world (not actually sure what this implies).

4. Science of protein decay

In a lab, experiments have demonstrated that proteins and tissues shouldn't last even a million years. (no references)

5. Palaeontology

Professor Roberto Fondi from the university of Sienna explains that bacteria and blue-green algae to men appear abruptly in the fossil record without any connection. So why do so many people think that fossils prove evolution? After nearly two centuries of research, the paleontological evidence for evolution is not only rare, but highly questionable. If evolution were really true, the evidence would be in abundance and incontestable. There is no evidence of transitional fossils. There is no indication that the situation will change in the future. At 13:35 they go through a list of transitional fossils, and say these are very far from conclusive.

6. Not 'biofilm' or contaminated

Mary has been able to replicate her findings suggesting that what she is working with is not contaminated. It continues saying a piece of triceratops bone has been decalcified so that all the bone is removed, and you can see blood vessels and soft tissue on top (At 23:20). Temperature change will change molecular motions causing it to degrade and decompose. At 25 minutes, they demonstrate soft fibred bone being peeled away which are full of cells. You can see blood vessels and see tiny little cells (At 25:10). Furthermore, one cannot argue that iron has preserved this tissue since we don't see this iron preservation in any recent remains - why doesn't iron preserve soft tissue that are only a few thousand years old? Iron from the blood (which is no way near these osteocytes) therefore cannot have preserved the tissue. Moreover, iron-oxides are incredibly reactive as well. There is no method we know of to preserve tissue for such a long time. 

Sorry this is a bit here and there, I wrote it as I watched the video (showing really how badly the argument is structurally organised). The lack of sources, poorly structured arguments and more show that its a load of bs, but I can't scientifically explain why with counter-evidence or explanations. I would be really grateful if you lot could help me. :)

Comprehensive report on the critique of the Darwinian theory of evolution in biochemistry

&amp;#x200B;

Criticism of the theory of Darwinian evolution in biochemistry

&amp;#x200B;

The theory of evolution of Charles Darwin lost credibility almost entirely at the approach of the twenty-first century, and this theory was adopted by some of the believers in material thought at the beginning of the twentieth century and tried to teach them to people and worked to prove their validity and imposed on it is a scientific fact fixed but these attempts failed and proved bankrupt The main factor behind the failure of this theory is the great development of some branches of science that are directly related to this theory, such as microbiology, biochemistry and paleontology. It was proved after this development in these sciences that life did not arise by accident and did not develop step by step as this theory claims and proved impossible to adopt this idea originally (for more details please see the chapter ""error theory of evolution""). This bankrupt theory failed to produce convincing scientific evidence on the origin of living species,

This particular deficit made believers in this theory in real trouble. This book explains and analyzes the ""sacrifice of living beings"" as a characteristic characteristic of some living beings. 

This sacrifice can be seen in nature constantly, and the symbiosis and cooperation between living beings can be seen clearly in addition to the compassion in the relations between them. All these natural phenomena posed questions to the theory of ""evolution"" and could not answer them, wondering what caused it?

Darwin's theory was based on an intellectual mechanism whose essence lay in the concept of natural selection, a mechanism that did not rely primarily on criticism or objective transference. Darwin thought that the origin of all living species was due to one grandfather and their presence in different natural conditions, And that the species that have shown adaptable according to the natural conditions in which they found have acquired new qualities inherited to the strains that came after it, for this reason, the species that showed adaptation are stronger for responding to the strength of the surrounding conditions and succeeded in survival and continuity, Though Razia Darwin expressed this to remain the strongest of any powerful individuals fit to stay alive and vulnerable are exposed to the courtyard.

Nature in the light of this hypothesis can be defined according to the statement of Julian Huxley, a friend close to Darwin and strongly advocates his theory as follows: ""is the arena of the selection of the strongest and the most effective of the weakest and failed, and inevitably this selection."" 

The question arises: Is it true that nature as claimed by the owners of the theory of evolution is the arena where the victory of the strongest and fittest and crush the weakest and presents to the courtyard with the utmost selfishness and strength as a form of life? .

This question can be answered by observing the forms of life in nature, and it is natural for organisms in nature to make an effort to live and defend themselves, since every living organism must hunt to preserve its life or defend itself, but the natural theater of the living Consists only of these two scenes, but it is possible to observe scenes in nature that speak of the most precious types of sacrifice carried out by animals for the benefit of their offspring and their communities or even towards animals or other species. In addition to sacrifice, the symbiosis and cooperation or the taking of another animal and the work to save it is a behavioral characteristic that can be seen in the world of nature.

These behavioral features in the world of nature were unable to explain the reasons for their occurrence, and proved that nature is not the scene of war as it is claimed that life in nature has proved the bankruptcy of the theory of evolution and its impotence completely, for example: Why Zebra (Zebra) fleeing from his predators And the strange behavior of the fish ""Atarina"" as we will see in the coming chapters, they endanger their life from the water to the sandy shores of whitening However, it is Natural selection could not be removed from the theater of nature. In the coming pages you will find something that makes you feel puzzled and surprised by animals that are irrational and irrational, It is only man who is fair and fair who can return the origin of these distinct behaviors to the creative and knowledgeable God alone in his creation, because the Almighty says in his clear book: ""The difference of night and day and the revelation of God from heaven. They are wise. "" ""Al-Jathiyyah, verse 4""

One of the dilemmas faced by the theory of evolution: logical behavior of animals. 

It is known that man is the only living being governed by rationality and logic in behavior. In addition to his physical characteristics, the unique advantage that made him on a different level from the rest of living beings is reason and logic. In light of this, man is characterized by self-accountability, thinking, planning, The act towards the events taking place and the reflection, as well as walking towards a specific goal all these behavioral qualities especially human. Other living organisms in nature do not have these qualities. For this reason, we can not expect the animals to have patterns of behavior similar to humans such as planning and assessment or to do some calculations like those of some engineers. 

So, how can we answer some of the logical behavioral phenomena in nature?

Even some animals that are characterized by these logical behaviors do not have a brain at all, and before answering this question must be closely acquainted with some of these behaviors to know but these behaviors and its origin.",7,18,1536043675,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9ct6wz/is_this_true_i_do_know_most_of_those_disproving/

I still have, on my bookshelf, books of Gould's essays that appeared in Natural History magazine, The official magazine of  of the Smithsonian Institute.

One of his books, The Panda's Thumb, is the name of a long standing [blog](https://pandasthumb.org) about evolution and creationism.

I think that Gould was eclipsed (pun intended) by Sagan because of Gould's advocacy of NOMA (Non-overlapping magisteria) and so Gould became regarded as an accommodationist. The more that I think about NOMA the more that I think that it should be regarded as a forgivable mistake.

“The present is the key to the past” 

-	Sir Charles Lyell

I make a living insuring oil wells get drilled were they are supposed to be drilled.  Unfortunately, it’s not as exciting as the documentary ‘Armageddon’ makes it look.  I spend my time looking at ground up rocks under a microscope, watching traces on computer screens, doing paper work, and missing my family, to date NASA has not approached me, although I suspect I’d be forced say that even they had…

Ultimately the most important thing I do is make educated decisions based of an incomplete data set using the principles of geology to fill in the gaps. Two users of this subreddit (/u/PaulDPrice and /u/No-Karma-II) recently brought up a term I first heard in the Hamm vs Nye debate, observational vs historical science.  This claim is a slap in the face to at the very least every geologist, as well as anyone else who uses observations today to explain the past.

Clearly (and sadly I might add) we don’t have a time machine to go back and see such wonders as the [Burgess Shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale) or the [Solnhofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solnhofen_Limestone) or other [Lagerstätte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerstätte) shortly before their burial. Thus we must combine the observations of current depositional events with observations of the rock record.  Some observations are trivial, my wife who has become rather annoyed with my hobby of looking at outcrops rather than the view on hikes can spot an [unconformity]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconformity) and has even been known to point them out on occasion. 

Slightly more complex than an unconformity is the sedimentary structure known as cross bedding.  [Cross bedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding#Trough_cross-beds) occurs on inclined [bedforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedform) when flow occurs, generally water or wind. These formations can tell us directional of flow, or paleocurrent, weather deposition occurred in a river, a tide dominated setting, a shallow marine environment etc. Finally these structures can be used as ‘way up’ markers for over turned beds. One of the best things about cross bedding is it can be observed as it forms in nature and in a [laboratory setting]( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-110-sedimentary-geology-spring-2007/lecture-notes/ch3.pdf).

Finally lets look a [glacial erratic’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic).  While there are other types of erratic’s, glacial erratic’s are the coolest simply because of their scale.  During periods of glaciation giant boulders are entrained within the ice flow, only to be deposited later on.  These rocks have clearly been transported long distances.  Today in areas of ice flows we can still see this occurring.  

I’ll stop here, as I don’t think anyone will want to read brief overviews of basic geology, and we’re off topic, but I hope I’ve at least touched three examples were the observations today clearly show a gap in deposition, direction and method of flow, as well as a way up indicator to identify overturned beds, and finally a very easy to spot sign that an area was exposed to glaciation. 

Without applying the observations that have been made recently to our models, industries such as agriculture, oil and gas, mining,  construction, technology, pharmaceuticals , etc. would all be at best shadows of their current selves, at worst impossible.  

As such I implore you, if you wish to criticize evolution, wonderful, everyone should be skeptical.  Being an informed skeptic equally as important.

If you'll allow me to preach to the choir: Even putting aside the fossil record, genetics, etc, no one can observe the great apes and honestly deny that we are the same type of creature.

It's just so in your face that even a creationist would have to admit that man was created in the physical image of an ape.

Instead, what I want to get to the bottom of is: does natural selection really explain how species arise (not where they came from)

Feyman said ""what I cannot create I do not understand"". Meaning, it's easy to postulate a mechanism, but what proves you understand something is if you can build an instantiation of it that behaves as you expect.  I think the field of [artificial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#Software-based_(%22soft%22)) is going to be the final test of the theory of natural selection, because obviously there's no other way to test the theories in real time.

And as of date, while there evolutionary computation has some some success on ""search and optimization"" (genetic algorithms) and some intriguing simple forms of creativity (like Karl Sims famous evolved creatues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8), no one has demonstrated a system that produces open ended evolution with increasing complexity even approaching what we find in biology.

I quote from a recent paper by Ken Stanley (a giant in the field of evolutionary computing.

""A full understanding of open-ended evolutionary dynamics
remains elusive. While artificial life worlds have been proposed
to study such dynamics and tests have been devised to
try to detect them, no theory yet has enumerated the key conditions that are essential to inducing them.""

One of these is the pacific golden plover.

The pacific golden plover winters in Hawaii, but migrates to Alaska, among other places, to breed. This journey is a grueling 3-day nonstop journey. Ornithologists find that this trip requires that the bird be spectacularly efficient in fat consumption in order to complete this journey. They put on an extra 50% of bodyweight in fat prior to the trip, and consume exactly that much in an 88-hour, 32-MPH nonstop flight of 2800 miles. Good thing, since they can’t swim or even float, and there are no islands *en route*. Calculations seemed to show that they were not efficient enough at flying, even though they are an order of magnitude more efficient than a jet plane, to make this trip, until research showed that they save 23% of their energy by flying in formation, taking turns at the inefficient “point” position. But that’s not the evolution-defying part.

Upon arrival in Alaska, the birds court, mate and breed. After the hatchlings fledge, the adults leave *en masse* for Hawaii, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Weeks later, the young congregate and depart, without anyone who has ever made the trip before. They must navigate to a tiny dot in the middle of an expansive and hostile ocean with no waypoints, and must deal with inclement weather and variable winds blowing them off course.

This is the part that defies gradualistic, evolutionary explanation: the Hawaiian Islands have always been a lonely, isolated dot in the middle of a vast, featureless ocean. They did not move slowly away from some seacoast so that the plover could develop its physical and navigational capabilities gradualistically. Most islands, like the Galapagos Islands, are isolated from the rest of the world and form their own ecosystem. Yet the pacific golden plover is uniquely and specifically equipped for this migratory mission!",0,96,1535553450,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b9u2y/the_pacific_golden_plover_defies_gradualistic/

I’m only 15 and have been raised with creationist science materials, so my understanding of evolutionary science (as well as cosmology and some geology) is shaky at best. So I apologize for my stupidity on the subject; I know that I have no idea what I’m talking about, but I’m trying to learn. Recently, I’ve gotten into a debate with my parents, who are staunch creationists; it’s been really fucking frustrating. I’d love a response to any of these points that you can help with. Thank you in advance.

**Claims from Creationists**

- The flagellum of certain bacteria is too complex to have evolved, as it functions like an outboard motor.

- The Cambrian explosion requires such a sudden, rapid of a growth in the population and number of species that it couldn’t have happened.

- It would be “nearly impossible” for amino acids to link together in exactly the right order to create life. According to Jay Wile, the chances of this occurring naturally are 1 in 10^152.

- DNA is too complex to have formed from evolution. *Any information on how DNA could have arisen would be great.*

**Creationists’ Arguments Against Evolution**

- There have been no “proven” transitional fossils (they don’t accept archaeopteryx or Lucy). Or else the fossil record does not hold up under scrutiny, and not enough fossils of transitional species are found.

- *This seems off-topic, but* can anyone share information on the accuracy and application of radioactive dating methods—such as carbon-14, rubidium-strontium, potassium-argon, and uranium-lead? I bring this up because I often see it argued in creationist materials that such dating methods are highly inaccurate, and this is one of the reasons they won’t accept the evidence in the fossil record.

**Arguments my Parents Make**

- I tried to explain to my mom how we’ve observed huge changes in species over brief periods of time—such as in dog breeding.

&gt;Well, that’s within a species! There’s no evidence of one species evolving into something else.

- So I made an argument like this: a species is a group of animals that can only breed within itself to produce sterile offspring. A species can, by mutation and selection, gradually change over time to become more distantly related to its ancestors. Therefore, it is possible for one species to evolve into a new species (a population which can only breed within itself).

&gt;THAT’S JUST SPECULATION

- She wants evidence of one species literally changing into another. **Does this indisputable evidence exist, and if so, can anyone provide it for me?** Otherwise, I’d greatly appreciate any counters to her absurdity lol, because I’m at my wit’s end. She also told me I was “changing definitions” by saying that microevolution and macroevolution are the same process over different time spans.

- I sent her [this article] (https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/evolution-and-natural-selection/a/lines-of-evidence-for-evolution). In response, she said we had to “back up” and she sent me [this] (https://creation.com/not-to-be-used-again-homologous-structures-and-the-presumption-of-originality-as-a-critical-value). She also sent me [this piece of shit] (http://www.mhrc.net/why.htm), but honestly I don’t even recommend that you waste time reading it.

- *Another off-topic question.* My parents are trying to say that the Universe had to have been designed because the second law of thermodynamics says that order cannot come from chaos. I tried to counter this by saying that the Universe is chaotic, and that gravity is the only order (of sorts) that we have. But they went “Aha!” and tried to corner me on that point.../facepalm/. How do I even argue this? Their only evidence for an “orderly Universe” is that everything orbits a greater mass, and that our solar system is “perfectly balanced” (bullfuckingshit), but I guess that’s enough for them.",17,52,1535550324,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b9exs/anyone_want_to_help_me_debate_creationists/
DebateEvolution,9b6207,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"""Genetic Entropy"" is BS: A Summary","The idea of “genetic entropy” is one of a very few “scientific” ideas to come from creationists. It’s the idea that humanity must be very young because harmful mutations are accumulating at a rate that will ultimately lead to our extinction, and so we, as a species, can’t be any older than a few thousand years. Therefore, creation. John Sanford proposed and tried to support this concept in his book “Genetic Entropy &amp; The Mystery of the Genome,” which is…wow it’s bad. 

Everything about the genetic entropy argument is wrong, including the term itself. But it comes up over and over and over, since it’s one of the few science-y-sounding creationist arguments out there, so join me as we quickly cover each reason why. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m going to do this in two parts. First we’ll have a bunch of quick points, and after, I’ll elaborate on the ones that merit a longer explanation. Each point will be labeled “P1”, “P2”, etc., as will each longer explanation. So if you want to find the long version, just control-f the P# for that point. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P1**: “Genetic entropy” is a made-up term invented by creationists to describe a concept that already existed: Error catastrophe. Even before it’s a vaguely scientific idea, the term “genetic entropy” is an attempt at branding, to make a process seem more dangerous or inevitable through changing the name. I’m going to use the term “error catastrophe” from here on when we’re talking about the actual population genetics phenomenon, and “genetic entropy” when talking about the silly creationist idea.

&amp;nbsp;

**P2**: Error catastrophe has never been observed or documented in nature or experimentally. In order to conclusively demonstrate error catastrophe, you must show these two things: That harmful mutations accumulate in a population *over generations*, and that these mutations cause a terminal decline in fitness, meaning that they cause the average reproductive output to fall below 1, meaning the population is shrinking, and will ultimately go extinct. 

This has never been demonstrated. There have been attempts to induce error catastrophe experimentally, and Sanford claims that H1N1 experienced error catastrophe during the 20th century, but all of these attempts have been unsuccessful and Sanford is wrong about H1N1 in every way possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P3**: The process through which genetic entropy supposedly occur is inherently contradictory. Either neutral mutations are not selected against and therefore accumulate, or harmful mutations are selected against, and therefore don’t accumulate. Mutations cannot simultaneously hurt fitness and not be selected against. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P4**: As deleterious mutations build up, the percentage of possible subsequent mutations that are harmful decreases, and the percentage of possible beneficial mutations increases. The simplest illustration is to look at a single site. Say a C mutates to a T and that this is harmful. Well now that harmful CT mutation is off the table, and a new beneficial TC mutation is possible. So over time, as harmful mutations accumulate, beneficial mutations become more likely. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P5**: (Somewhat related to P4) A higher mutation rate provides more chances to find beneficial mutations, so even though more harmful mutations will occur, they are more likely to be selected out by novel beneficial genotypes that are found and selected for. This is slightly different from P4, which was about the proportion of mutations; this is just raw numbers. More mutations means more beneficial mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P6**: Sanford is dishonest. His work surrounding “genetic entropy” is riddled with glaring inaccuracies that are either deliberate misrepresentations, or the result of such egregious ignorance that it qualifies as dishonesty. 

Two of the most glaring examples are his misrepresentation of a distribution of fitness effects produced by Motoo Kimura, and his portrayal of H1N1 fitness over time.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Below this point you’ll find more details for some of the above points.**

&amp;nbsp;

**P2**: Error catastrophe has never been observed, experimentally nor in nature. There have been a number of attempts at inducing error catastrophe experimentally, but none have been successful. Some work from [Crotty et al.]( http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6895.short) is notable in that they *claimed* to have induced error catastrophe, but actually only maybe documented lethal mutagenesis, a broader term that refers to any situation in which a large number of mutations cause death or extinction. Their single round of mutagenic treatment of infectious genomes necessarily could not involve mutation accumulation over generations, and so while mutations my have caused the fitness decline, it isn’t wasn’t through error catastrophe. It’s also possible the observed fitness costs were due to something else entirely, since the mutagen they used [has many effects]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483).

J.J. Bull and his team have also worked extensively on this question, and outline their work and the associated challenges [here](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541). In short, they were not able to demonstrate terminal fitness decline due to mutation accumulation over generations, and in one series of experiments [actually observed fitness *gains* during mutagenic treatment of bacteriophages]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879444/).

You’ll notice that all of that work involves bacteriophages and mutagenic treatment. What about humans? Well, phages are the ideal targets for lethal mutagenesis, especially RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages. These organisms have mutation and substitution rates [orders of magnitude higher than double-stranded DNA viruses and cellular organisms]( http://www.origem.info/FIC/pdf/Duffy%20et%20al%20Rates%20of%20Evol%20Change_Nat%20Rev%20Gen08.pdf) (pdf). They also have small, dense genome, meaning that there are very few intergenic regions, most of which contain regulatory elements, and even some of the reading frames are overlapping and offset, which means there are regions with no wobble sites. 

This means that deleterious mutations should be a higher percentage of the mutation spectrum compared to, say, the human genome. So mutations happening faster plus more likely to be harmful equals ideal targets for error catastrophe. 

In contrast, the human genome is only about 10% functional (&lt;2% exons, 1% regulatory, some RNA genes, a few percent structural and spacers; stuff with documented functions adds up to a bit south of 10%). It’s possible up to 15% or so has a selected function, but given what we know about the rest, any more than that is [very unlikely]( https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2018/03/whats-in-your-genome-pie-chart.html). So the percentage of possible mutations that are harmful is far lower in the human genome compared to the viral genomes. And we have lower mutation and substitution rates. 

All of that just means we’re very unlikely to experience error catastrophe, while the viruses are the ideal candidates. And if the viruses aren’t susceptible to it, then the human genome sure as hell isn’t. 

But what of H1N1? Isn’t that a documented case of error catastrophe. That’s what Sanford claims, after all.

Except yeah wow that [H1N1 paper]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23062055) is *terrible*. Like, it’s my favorite bad paper, because they manage to get *everything* wrong. Here’s a short list of the errors the authors commit:

They ignored neutral mutations. 

They claimed H1N1 went extinct. It didn’t. Strains cycle in frequency. It’s called strain replacement.

They conflated intra- and inter-host selection, and in doing so categorize a bunch of mutations as harmful when they were probably adaptive. 

They treated codon bias as a strong indicator of fitness. It isn’t. Translational selection (i.e. selection to match host codon preferences) [doesn’t seem to do much in RNA viruses]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564115/).

They ignored host-specific constraints based on immune response, specifically how mammals use CpG dinucleotides to recognize foreign DNA/RNA and trigger an immune response. In doing so, they categorized changes in codon bias as deleterious when they were almost certainly adaptive.

They conflated virulence (how sick a virus makes you) with fitness (viral reproductive success). Not the same thing. And sometimes *inversely* correlated. 

Related, in using virulence as a proxy for fitness, they ignored the major advances in medicine from 1918 to the 2000s, *including the introduction of antibiotics*, which is kind of a big deal, since back then and still today, most serious influenza cases and deaths are due to secondary pneumonia infections. 

So no, we’ve never documented an instance of error catastrophe. Not in the lab. Not in H1N1. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P3**: “Genetic entropy” *supposedly* works like this: Mutations that are only a little bit harmful (dubbed “very slightly deleterious mutations” or VSDMs) occur, and because they are only a teensy bit bad, they cannot be selected out of the population. So they accumulate, and at some point, they build up to the point where they *are* harmful, and at that point it’s too late; everybody is burdened by the harmful mutations, has low fitness, and the population ultimately goes extinct. 

Here are all of the options for how this doesn’t work.

One, you could have a bunch of neutral mutations. Neutral because they have no effect on reproductive output. That’s what neutral means. They accumulate, but there are no fitness effects. So the population doesn’t go extinct – no error catastrophe.

Or you could have a bunch of harmful mutations. Individually, each with have a small effect on fitness. Individuals who by chance have these mutations have lower fitness, meaning these mutations experience negative selection. Maybe they are selected out of the population. Maybe they persist at low frequency. Either way, the population doesn’t go extinct, since there are always more fit individuals (who don’t have any of the bad mutations) present to outcompete those who do. So no error catastrophe. 

Or, option three, everyone experiences a bunch of mutations all at once. All in one generation, every member of a population gets slammed with a bunch of harmful mutations, and fitness declines precipitously. The average reproductive output falls below 1, and the population goes extinct. *This is also not error catastrophe*. Error catastrophe requires mutations to accumulate *over generations*. This all happened in a single generation. It’s lethal mutagenesis, a broader process in which a bunch of mutations cause death or extinction, but it *isn’t* the more specific error catastrophe. 

But we can do a better job making the creationist case for them. Here’s the strongest version of this argument that creationists can make. It’s not that the mutations are neutral, having no fitness effect, and then at some threshold become harmful, and now cause a fitness decline population-wide. It’s that they are neutral alone, but together, they experience *epistasis*, which just means that two or more mutations interact to have an effect that is different from any of them alone. 

So you can’t select out individual mutations (since they’re neutral), which accumulate in every member of the population over many generations. But subsequent mutations interact (that’s the epistasis), reducing fitness across the board. 

*But that still doesn’t work*. It just pushed back the threshold for when selection happens. Instead of having some optimal baseline that can tolerate a bunch of mutations, we have a much more fragile baseline, wherein any one of a number of mutations causes a fitness decline. 

But as soon as that happens in an individual, those mutations are selected against (because they hurt fitness due to the epistatic effects). So like above, you’d need *everyone* to get hit all in a single generation. And a one-generation fitness decline isn’t error catastrophe. 

So even the *best* version of this argument fails.

&amp;nbsp; 

**P4** and **P5**: I’m going to cover these together, since they’re pretty similar and generally work the same way. 

Basically, when you have bunch of mutations, two things operate that make error catastrophe less likely than you would expect. 

First, the distribution of fitness effects changes as mutations occur. When a deleterious mutation occurs, at least one deleterious mutation (the one that just occurred) is removed from the universe of possible deleterious mutations, and at least one *beneficial* mutation is added (the back mutation). But there are also additional beneficial mutations that may be possible now, but weren’t before, due to epistasis with that new harmful mutation. These can recover the fitness cost of that mutation, or even work together with it to recover fitness *above* the initial baseline. These types of mutations are called *compensatory mutations*, and while Sanford discusses epistasis causing harmful mutations to stack, he does not adequately weigh the effects in the other direction, as I’ve described here. 

Related, when you have a ton of mutations, you’re just more likely to find the good ones. We actually have evidence that a number of organisms have been selected to maintain higher-than-expected mutations rates, probably due to the advantage this provides. My favorite example is a ssDNA bacteriophage called phiX174. It infects *E. coli*, but lacks the “check me” sequences that its host uses to correct errors in its own genome. By artificially inserting those sequences into the phage genome, it’s mutation rate can be substantially decreased. Available evidence says that selection maintains the higher mutation rate. We also see that during mutagenic treatment, [viruses can actually become more fit]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815918/), contrary to expectations. 

So as mutations occur, beneficial mutations become more likely, and more beneficial mutations will be found. Both processes undercut the notion of “genetic entropy”. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P6**: John Sanford is a liar. There’s really isn’t a diplomatic way to say it. He’s a dishonest hack who misrepresents ideas and data. I’ve covered this before, but I’ll do it again here, for completeness.

I’m only going to cover one particularly egregious example here, but see [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95wubb/defend_sanford/) for another I’m going to stick to the use of a distribution of mutation fitness effects from Motoo Kimura’s work, which Sanford modifies in “Genetic Entropy,” and uses to argue that beneficial mutations are too rare to undo the inevitable buildup of harmful mutations. 

Now first, Sanford claims to show a “corrected” distribution, since Kimura omitted beneficial mutations entirely from his. Except this “corrected” distribution is based on nothing. No data. No experiments. Nothing. It’s literally “I think this looks about right”. Ta-da! “Corrected”. Sure.

Second, Sanford justifies his distribution by claiming that Kimura omitted beneficial mutations because he knew they are so rare they don’t really matter anyway. He wrote:

&gt;In Kimura’s figure, he does not show any mutations to the right of zero – i.e. there are zero beneficial mutations shown. He obviously considered beneficial mutations so rare as to be outside of consideration.

Kimura’s rationale was the exact opposite of this. His distribution represents the parameters for a model demonstrating genetic drift (random changes in allele frequency). He wrote:

&gt;The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.

In other words, if you include beneficial mutations, they are selected for and take over the simulation, completely obscuring the role genetic drift plays. So because they occur too frequently and have too great an effect, they were omitted from consideration. 

Okay, let’s give Sanford the benefit of the doubt on the first go. Maybe, despite writing a book that leans heavily on Kimura’s work, and using one of Kimura’s figures, Sanford never actually *read* Kimura’s work, and honestly didn’t realize hat Kimura’s rationale was the exact opposite of what Sanford claims. Seems improbable, but let’s say it was an honest mistake. 

The above passage (and the broader context) were *specifically* [pointed out to Sanford[(https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/gen_entropy/), but he persisted in his claim that he was accurately representing Kimura’s work. He wrote:

&gt;Kimura himself, were he alive, would gladly attest to the fact that beneficial mutations are the rarest type

The interesting thing with that line is that it’s a slight hedge compared to the earlier statement. This indicates two things. First, that Sanford *knows* he’s wrong about Kimura’s rationale, and second, that he wants to continue to portray Kimura as agreeing with him, *even though he clearly knows better*.  

There’s more in the link at the top of this section, but this is sufficient to establish that Sanford is a liar. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s…I won’t say everything, because this is a deep well, but that’s a reasonable rundown of why nobody should take “genetic entropy” seriously. 

&amp;nbsp;

Creationists, if you want to beat the genetic entropy drum, you need to deal with each one of these points. (Okay maybe not P6, unless you want to defend Sanford.) So if and when you respond, specifically state which point you dispute and why. Be specific. Cite evidence.

DebateEvolution,9b575x,Race--Realist,,t2_v8j1d30,self.DebateEvolution,,Natural Selection is not an explanatory mechanism; it cannot explain speciation nor trait fixation,"NS is not, nor can it be as is currently formulated, a mechanism of speciation or trait fixation, as those who formulated the NS, the current Neo-Darwinian paradigm, propose:

When two traits are coextensive, how does NS distinguish the one that causes fitness from the trait that doesn’t (its linked free-rider)? It can’t because selection-for is an intensional notion.

The theory of natural selection states that organisms are selected for the relative fitness of their phenotypes in relation to their ecologies. Phenotypic traits are selected for their role in causing increases in fitness corresponding with the following principle:

If in a given ecology, organisms with T1 are more fit than organisms with T2, then, all else being equal, creatures with T1 will be selected and not creatures with T2. If both of these organisms are equally fit, then neither type of organism will be selected in preference to the other organism. But what if T1 and T2 are linked? Now suppose that T1 causes increased fitness and T2 does not. The traits are linked, so the correlation of T2 and fitness is the same as the correlation of T1 with fitness. Thus, all else being equal, if T1 is selected then so is T2. If T2 is selected then so is T1.

Darwin should have said that traits are selected which cause alterations in fitness in a given ecology, not that they’re correlated with alterations in fitness. But then Darwin would have needed to identify a mechanism that in a given ecology responds differently to phenotypic traits depending on whether or not they are causes of alterations of fitness of merely correlated with the causes of the alterations of fitness. In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of natural selection.

The theory of NS presumes a distinction between “selects” and “selects-for”, so for the theory to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2): (1) that NS has a mind/mental powers since intensionality is intentional, then intentional states have the ability to distinguish between coextensive traits; and (2) counter-factual supporting laws that phylogenetically link certain phylogenetic traits across different ecologies so that if you have one, you have the other. There is no agent of selection, (1) is discarded and there are no laws of selection so (2) is discarded so:

P1) For NS to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2).

P2) NS does not satisfy (1) or (2).

C) NS does not explain trait fixation.

Fodor's argument against NS is conceptual, thus empirical evidence is irrelevant to his argument. TNS does not explain trait fixation/speciation. At best worst, NS is false; at best, NS is a small driver of evolutionary change. But NS cannot be a mechanism since it cannot select between coextensive traits since NS is not minded (it's not an agent, it cannot intentionally choose between a fitness-enhancing trait and a linked free-rider), nor are there nomological laws that explain trait fixation. There need to be generalizeable laws, such as ""P1 phenotypes are more fit than P2 phenotypes in a given ecology"", or ""T1 causes fitness in ecology E but not T2"", or ""In ecology E, T1s are selected but not T2"" or ""Trait T in ecology E increases fitness"", or Fodor's ""All else being equal, the probability that a t1 wins a competition with a t2 in ecological situation E is p."" (What Darwin Got Wrong, pg 121) Laws of selection, meaning laws that govern the fitness of traits, need to be generalizeable across all ecologies and species; the law must determine which traits win which competitions in a given ecology.

Further touching on (1) and (2): NS needs to act on counterfactuals; but, as said in (1) and (2), it cannot act on counterfactuals because NS is not an agent (it cannot choose between two locally coextensive traits), nor are there laws of selection that are generalizable across all ecologies that explain trait fixation.

But, on the artificial selection point: Darwin was wrong to compare NS with animal breeders choosing traits: Animal breeders have minds; they can select-for and against traits (those terms are intensional); NS cannot choose between traits because it lacks a mind and there are no nomological laws that explain trait fixation.

I should touch on one more thing here: the claim from neo-Darwinists that species are ""perfectly fit"" for their ecologies on the basis of fitness-enhancing traits being selected-for their contribution to fitness in a given ecology is either a tautology or irrelevant to how traits evolve. Take this argument:

P1) Niches are individuated post hoc by reference to the phenotypes that live in said niche.

P2) If the organisms weren’t there, the niche would not be there either.

C) Therefore there is no fitness of phenotypes to lifestyles that explain said adaptation.

In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of ""natural selection"".

Also see Fodor's argument as articulated in What Darwin Got Wrong (pg 114):

1. *Selection-for is a causal process.*
2. ***Actual*** *causal relations aren’t sensitive to* ***counterfactual*** *states of affairs: if it* ***wasn’t*** *the case that A, then the fact that it’s being A* ***would have caused its being B*** *doesn’t explain its being the case that B.*
3. *But the distinction between traits that are selected-for and their free-riders turns on the truth (or falsity) of relevant counterfactuals.*
4. *So if T and T’ are coextensive, selection cannot distinguish the case in which T free-rides on T’ from the case that T’ free-rides on T.*
5. *So the claim that selection is the mechanism of evolution cannot be true.*",0,199,1535508837,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b575x/natural_selection_is_not_an_explanatory_mechanism/

&amp;#x200B;

# [Sarcasm]

&amp;#x200B;

In 1940, the eminent geneticist Richard Goldschmidt published the book \*The Material Basis of Evolution\*, in which he put forth the hypothesis that the gaps in the fossil record that existed then, and still exist to this day, are real, and have been breached by what he termed ""macromutations"" (large mutations), very rare but real events, generating ""hopeful monsters"". An example would be a therapod dinosaur laying eggs, from which fully-formed birds hatch.

&amp;#x200B;

All your criticisms of this hypothesis have been nothing more than **arguments from incredulity**. Are you saying that this is an *impossibility*? It is not impossible; it is only unlikely, and therefore very rare.

One aspect of genetic entropy is the realization that most mutations are very slightly deleterious, and very few mutations are beneficial. Another aspect is the realization that natural selection is confounded by features such as biological noise, haldane's dilemma and mueller's ratchet. Natural selection is unable to stop degeneration in the long run, let alone cause an upward trend of increasing integrated complexity in genomes.

DebateEvolution,9a4ned,GaryGaulin,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Scientifically Acceptable Non-DI Theory of ID in Science and Education, At Your Service.","This topic is to hopefully make it easy to make sense of what I started off explaining in this thread that became too fragmented and chaotic for me to write a proper response to:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/99s80n/creationism_is_not_a_useful_word_it_conflates/

To this good question I can say:

&gt; What do you think the significance of that research is?

You have to look at this from the perspective of cognitive science researchers who (to fully model complex neural behaviors) have to model cellular and the molecular level processes that are at least as complicated a system to figure out as our brain and body. Cognitive scientists don't have the luxury of talking about mutation and selection, they're ultimately responsible for a working computational model ultimately showing biological development from the origin(s) of life on up to us. What gets favored in a given environment over another is something that gets watched, after it's working and time to relax and admire the new creation(s). 

The stuff of life that fills the universe may likely seed a starter molecular trial and error learning system(s) that might right now be belching out of underwater vents and/or other places. But existing living things took their niche away by changing even the atmosphere, thus they cannot reestablish themselves on beaches and other possible now gone safe incubators needed to endure past that. No matter what the starting chemistry was, you're responsible for modeling that part too, while showing ""learning rate"" and other required indicators needed to monitor performance of something either intelligent, or when learning rate is zero is not intelligent.  

Having to study ""natural selection"" related theory on top of all the theory needed for modern cognitive science is something best avoided, anyway. With all said this premise for a theory becomes true. Our not needing Darwinian variables makes all after the comma very true as well: 

&gt; The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.

Where all in ""science"" is in proper balance those who were sincere about scientific development of a new theory that somehow gives the Darwinian theory in its place (by via cognitive science being where the latest science fun's at for origins theory development) already has one, through my explaining what to look for and easiest way to begin in neuroscience related forms. No protest necessary, already done. Proves that the power of science 

Otherwise the ID controversy festers, one of the bad things to happen to anyone who break the like commandment ""science"" has in place that proclaims ""Thou shalt not take any scientifically possible theory untentatively!""

This only requires your accepting that the theory I have long been explaining in other forums makes statements like ""Neither position is based on or supported by any evidence"" not always true. Otherwise there is no example to show what Judge Jones was expecting of the Discovery Institute, where he could truthfully say that if their students could graduate from high school knowing all that it gets into like digital electronics then he would be proud too.

Science has become a whole lot easier to navigate. Even the premise of the Theory of Intelligent Design has been put into scientific context. It's so powerful that for those like you who wanted to put the DI in their place it's the same thing as already ""beating them at their own game"" strong. There's actually no greater science fun for you than that. 

To be credible I have to make no exceptions and not forget the roots of much of my work, where I want all in the heart of creationism country to be proud of. I help show what's possible, what ""creationism"" in turn becomes from it is as always up to them. In their case Kathy is state school board legend with two term happy ending that inspired something of significance to science. To these ""creationists"" it has always been disturbing to see fear of at least trying to from that one sentence premise follow the evidence to wherever it leads. In that sense the theory is from creationist thought, where instead of being a science stopper there's a science starter, that did NOT come from the Discovery Institute it's from the citizenry of the state they tried to get ""a foothold"" to from there conquer the country through. The DI's being powerless against what instead came from them is a compliment so putting the DI in their place is likewise fine by them, part of the science fun.

There needed to be something that shows where the DI was lacking and fun times like the self-assembly demonstration becoming NSTA approved then credit having to go to the most despised of them all at the time ""creationist"" in the whole world, who just happened to have been a NSTA member. Otherwise the trouble the DI was getting some into would have been there would have been around to try making sense of a such a complicated issue. It's now all state education history with hero's that has a way of locally changing how creationists feel about themselves and others that changes creationism. 

By the time Ben Stein had his movie out creationists were mostly bored by the same old and did not turn out. Many also saw it as thinly veiled Darwinian theory was like siding with the devil, not theory where Darwinian variables like ""natural selection"" are never once found, which in science is as good as it gets for showing how well the ID theory from elsewhere stands on its own merit, in a way that's good for creationism too. 

As I often have to now mention: the most scientific thing I found to do is [lighten up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIYiGA_rIls&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx) and accept that the ID controversy has has very much changed on account of progress of a scientific theory that has great signifance in many areas of science, and science education. An expected [weird story behind it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OpBylwH9DU) is also another plus, in our favor.

The Non-DI theory is now before you, and all that, where as you can see it's built on a grade school level explanation of the scientific method and other vital to understand science basics that are good to know. The rest was easily enough explained in other forums where only a few quick replies about how this works in neural models was enough said, no issue. In this forum though some things needed answering, in at least that many words. I cannot think of what might possibly be left to debate, but that's what this forum is for, so there it is.

In studying the conjunctiva of mice, researchers were amazed to discover that a microbiome exists there, a place experts long thought was a sterile environment. They thought this because of the fact that the tears that wash the eyeball contain an enzyme called lysozyme, whose task it is to destroy bacteria by lysing, or chopping up, its cell wall by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds. Somehow, they don't yet know how, the microbiome's ""good"" bacteria are not affected by this lysozyme.

We know that in the gut flora, beneficial microbes compete with pathogenic microbes and keep them in check, a process called competitive exclusion. Something like this appears to be occurring in the conjunctiva's microbiome^(2). The researchers isolated a species of bacteria called *Corynebacterium mastitidis* (*C. mast*) and wondered whether it was a resident or invader of the microbiome. They tried combining *C. mast* with the conjunctiva's immune cells, and amazingly discovered that a signaling protein (cytokine) was produced! This same substance is produced by white blood cells called *lymphocytes* and *macrophages*, and is responsible for stimulating the production of other white cells, which in turn emit antimicrobial proteins into the tears. Somehow, though, the *C. mast* bacteria are not affected by the antimicrobial proteins that they signaled to be generated! Scientists ""still don't know what enables *C. mast* to successfully establish itself in the eye, whereas other similar bacteria fail to colonize.""^(3)

This is not the first, but merely the latest, example of complex interactions between a host and its microbiomes that defies evolutionary explanation.

DebateEvolution,97g5s9,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com: Arguments we think creationists should NOT use,"It's a common criticism from evolutionists that creationists don't adjust their arguments in the face of evidence. From my perspective, I'm going to say that's very true, at least for the most part. Creationists are using the same arguments for decades, and these arguments haven't changed much, despite [databases of counter arguments explaining why they're wrong.](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html)

As user u/Toaster_In_Bathtub says, it makes creationism look intellectually dishonest, when they don't seem to have any care for contradictory evidence.

From a purely methodical and logical perspective, there's only three honest things to do when presented with counter-arguments to your own arguments:

1. Accept the counter argument, and redact your claim.
2. Present a reason why the counter argument was wrong.
3. Adjust your argument in such a way that it doesn't contradict the counter argument.

Yet creationists rarely do that. They hold fast to their arguments, most of the time refusing to even address the counter arguments. On the occasions when they do address them, they'll usually dismiss them without properly dealing with them.

There is an article on Creation.com called [Arguments we think creationists should NOT use](https://creation.com/arguments-we-think-creationists-should-not-use). Creationists will, on occasion, use this article to show that creationists do redact false arguments, and thus aren't dishonest.

My opinion on this article, is it doesn't really show that at all. When reading through the list of arguments on that article, the first thing that jumps out is how safe they all are. No big arguments, no major points of content. Just little safe arguments, most of which I'd never heard from creationists before reading them in this article.

There are so many arguments they use that, at this point, are obviously wrong. Arguments that have either been refuted so thoroughly, or are based on such faulty premises, that there isn't even much ambiguity on the matter. For example:

* Mutations can't increase information. Shouldn't be used because creationists can't measure or usefully define information.

* Archeopteryx is fully bird. Obviously it has both bird and dinosaur features.

* Examples of quick burial are proof of the flood. Quick burials happen naturally, all the time.

* Irreducible complexity examples where we have potential pathways for.

There are a number of other arguments that should be redacted, but I won't list because they're more ambiguous.

So the question is, why do creationists refuse to drop arguments? I believe there are a number of reasons. First of all, creationists want to look out for other creationists. They don't want to say that other creationists are wrong. There's also the logistical nightmare of cleaning up after admitting an argument is wrong. Imagine having to remove half the articles they've published because they use arguments they've now redacted. Imagine how the authors of those articles would react. I believe most heavily religious people have issues dealing with doubt. That they have to constantly struggle to protect their beliefs from reality. And if they accept even a single argument is wrong, they may have to ask what else they're wrong about, and that could lead to a crisis of faith.

There are so many arguments, rebuttals, refutations, evidence, theories, and beliefs. I just don’t ever see anyone winning this debate when there is always something that can be said against and for both sides.

I mean, wouldn’t that diminish faith?

That could even change the tone we have towards  God.... almost as if it would rip the innocence of our child-like hearts...


As for Evolutionists.... 
I see there have been eye-witnesses, predictions that have come true, evidence to support claims... it’s the same thing for Creationists yet we’re called crazy for believing in a “book” but Evolutionists believe in many books. 


I believe in most cases, I have seen both sides making the audience feel dumb for believing in either side... both beliefs outside of them sound absurd! Yet with passion, we make them out to be quite real.

I think this is one of the first lies the creationist community feeds to its cult and people eat it up. The only difference here is time scales.

\&gt; Earlier interpretations on genetic similarity were based on a superficial and deceptive approach. When you look at the broader picture of genetic expression and interaction, the separation between say chimpanzees and humans becomes much more evident

So is genome sequencing superficial and deceptive? 

\&gt; Since chimpanzees and human may be about 96% similar, we suggest to the evolutionist to allow the chimpanzee about 96% of our human rights. 

Although I don't know much about genetics, I'm 110% sure the claim about *96% of our human rights* grossly oversimplified and BS. Does anyone know what these ""rights"" are? 

\&gt; Fortunately, we don't call them human. We don't allocate rights on the basis of genetic expression and that distance is significantly greater than 4% when gene expression and other interactions are taken into account

Correct me if I'm wrong, but we are ""human"" due to the different *sequence* of genes, *presence* of genes, and the number of *copies of genes* we share with chimps. Also, gene expressions and interactions isn't the cause of more genetic divergence. In fact, does this have any role in causing more genetic divergence? According to [talk.origins](https://talk.origins): *Insertion and deletion (indel) events account for another approximately 3 percent difference between chimp and human sequences, but each indel typically involves multiple nucleotides. The number of genetic changes from indels is a fraction of the number of single-nucleotide substitutions (roughly 5 million compared with roughly 35 million). So describing humans and chimpanzees as 98 to 99 percent identical is entirely appropriate (Chimpanzee Sequencing 2005).* ",3,3,1534296937,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/97e8bh/better_response_for_this_dishonest_creationist/

DebateEvolution,96rr0g,Metamorphone,"Former YEC, Geology student",,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com on out of order fossils,"I wanted to make this post as a clear example to everyone on how far off the mark these creationist articles are. Here's the link I'll be using, this one regarding so called ""out of order"" fossils: https://creation.com/fossils-out-of-order

The authors of the article make several claims, but the gist is that fossils they think are equivalent to Precambrian rabbits are abundant. They also link to work done by Carl Werner, which will be discussed below. But lets get into this. 

Their fist issue is that they think the conventional chronology is too plastic. For example, if we find evidence of some plant fossil in rocks 100 million years earlier than we thought they existed, we'll just adjust the chronology because the fossil record isn't perfect. They then claim that any fossil, no matter how out of place, can theoretically be incorporated and not falsify evolution. 

This isn't really the case. Fossil range extensions are indeed a valid thing, but what creationists don't get is that there are limits. For example, if you found the fossil of a flowering plant from the Cenozoic in the Silurian, that can't be a range extension; as the most primitive members identified as plants have not shown up, so no method of evolution can be incorporated to explain this. Likewise, if we find a dinosaur fossil before even the most primitive reptiles, that cannot be a range extension for the same reasons. They don't mention this limit that paleontologists work with, and instead straw man what they actually do. Not shocking. 

Next up they start making arguments about evolution's ability to predict fossils, and why it ""falls dramatically short."" These include statements Darwin made about fossilization, the stasis of fossil jellyfish, fossilized ink sacs, and the burial of an ichthyosaur giving birth. But do any of these actually mean much? No. While Darwin himself did say that ""no organism wholly soft can be preserved,"" the change of life over geologic time has nothing to do with mechanisms of fossilization. Evolution does not predict, contrary to the author's assertion, that soft body fossils cannot be found. That doesn't even make sense, given all we know about things like Lagerstätten deposits. 

Fossilized Jellyfish do show pretty good morphological similarity, but that doesn't really tell us a lot. Many jellyfish alive today show even more closeness to each other, yet still have different behavioral patterns, biochemistry, etc. The problem is fossilization only preserves morphology and not any of these other features, so we can't just say they're exactly the same. As for the fossilized ink, there are [good reasons](http://reasons.org/explore/publications/nrtb-e-zine/read/nrtb-e-zine/2012/08/01/do-fossilized-ink-sacs-discolor-the-case-for-an-old-earth) why it could survive so long. It also wasn't fresh ink they could just dab and write with. It was solidified and only became a sort of ""paint"" (not ink) when mixed with an ammonia solution. Hardly fresh. The ichthyosaur isn't shocking either. Geologists have known since the mid 1900's about turbidite deposits, basically underwater landslides that accompany earthquakes. These not only explain singular examples but also [ichthyosaur graveyards.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262603758_A_Lower_Cretaceous_ichthyosaur_graveyard_in_deep_marine_slope_channe_ldeposits_at_Torres_del_Paine_National_Park_Southern_Chile) This phenomenon is well known, and runs contrary to the authors hint that geologists will still claim these were buried slowly. 

Some other examples they throw up: 

&gt;Trilobites, which are allegedly 500 myo in the Cambrian strata, have eyes that are far too complex for their place in the fossil record. That is, they have no precursors to their appearance.

[We actually have a lot of information on trilobite precursors](http://www.trilobites.info/origins.htm)

&gt;Perhaps most astonishingly, pollen fossils—evidence of flowering plants—were found in the Precambrian strata. According to evolutionists, flowering plants first evolved 160 mya, but the Precambrian strata is older than 550 mya.

If they're referring to creationist work on this, [creationists themselves falsified it.](https://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/burdick_polen_kh.htm) If its to the ""Roraima Pollen Paradox"" claim, [thats also wrong,](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/responding-to-flood-geology/roraima) and was never replicated in future studies. 

&gt;Dinosaurs are supposed to have evolved into birds. But Confuciusornis was a true beaked bird that pre-dates the ‘feathered’ dinosaurs that it allegedly came from. It also has been found in the stomach of a dinosaur.

The authors don't recognize that evolution branches, it isn't linear. Birds evolved from dinosaurs, and *are* dinosaurs, but a Velociraptor didn't become a Macaw. 

&gt;A dog-like mammal fossil was found with remains of dinosaurs in its stomach—but no mammals large enough to prey on dinosaurs were supposed to exist alongside them.

The mammal was actually the size of a large cat, so not very big, and the dinosaur was only 5 five inches long. It was a relatively small mammal and an even smaller dinosaur. They completely misrepresented the animal's scales, and what it meant. 

&gt;A mammal hair was found in amber supposed 100 million years old. Once again, this is smack in the middle of the alleged ‘age of dinosaurs’ when no such mammals existed.

Conventional wisdom places the first mammals around 210 million years ago. We knew they existed around this time. The authors are just wrong. 

&gt;Living fossils, and Carl Werner 

[Oh boy..](http://dogmadebate.blogspot.com/2013/07/what-is-all-this-fuss-over-living.html). Werner is a joke. He speaks in extremely vague  terms and has literally said ""Some physicians in the past have helped other fields. Therefore even a Physicians uneducated opinion is on par with a trained expert."" That's just...wow. Just wow. 

&gt;Tiktaalik is predated by other footprints 

Irrelevant. Tiktaalik's position, and geologic environment, was predicted by evolution and paleontology. Not possible if Flood Geology was true. The footprints themselves aren't even fully established. There's a range of options and later reasearch...all of which YEC authors never report. [Even Wikipedia lists them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik)

&gt;Cambrian explosion 

And another [PRATT.](https://biologos.org/common-questions/scientific-evidence/cambrian-explosion) 

They close with this: 

&gt;In fact, the more fossils we find, the more random the picture becomes. 

Sure, when you leave out relevant data and ignore further research you can get that impression. But it's just not true though. Not when we look at the actual data and research done.

DebateEvolution,963ofv,Metamorphone,"Former YEC, Geology student",,self.DebateEvolution,,Regarding Flood sorting mechanisms,"I wanted to make a brief post for people to be able to use in the future whenever arguing with creationists about the fossil record and their attempts to explain it via the Flood. I figured this might save people some time instead of having to type it out themselves. I'll try to keep it brief. 

So creationists generally have three main sorting mechanisms for Flood geology that they like to use to explain fossils, and occasionally a fourth. These are Hydrologic Sorting, Ecological Zonation, Differential Escape, and TABs. I'll elaborate on them and their problems below. I'm pulling the definitions from here: https://creation.com/order-in-the-fossil-record

Hydrologic Sorting is the notion that ""the smaller, denser, and more spheroid organisms are, the quicker they will settle out of the Floodwaters into sediments."" Now this does make sense, it would happen in a Flood scenario I'm sure. But it doesn't explain most of the fossils we see. For example, when we look 

Differential escape is where ""the smarter, more endothermic, and greater mobility an organism has, the higher in the fossil record it will tend to be."" I'm not sure why they associate how endothermic something is with speed, surely things like velociraptors could outrun many warm blooded mammals. That aside this doesn't explain much at all. For instance, how did whales manage to outrun the floodwaters? Moreover how could whales outrun dinosaurs? Or likewise, why are birds and pterodactyls not found together? The list goes on. 

Ecological Zonation means ""that different life-forms in different strata reflect the serial destruction, transport and burial of ecological life-zones during the Flood."" [Here's a model of it.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wrXgOqe-sYQ/Un0ioHP98qI/AAAAAAAAAE8/y59F9XNEFzg/s1600/2136019258_e746f3a830_z.jpg) So you'd start by burying bottom dwelling sea creatures, then shore dwelling sea life and animals near the shore, then further inland and higher elevations the reptiles and dinosaurs, then higher up to the mammals and so on. The problems here are numerous. We should under this model expect to find deep sea reptiles, such as plesiosaurs, ichtyosaurs, and sea turtles buried much lower in the Flood sediments than land reptiles and amphibians such as Eryops, Lagosuchus or Herrerasaurus. Instead, we find the marine reptiles consistently higher in the column than these land animals. We should find whales and marine reptiles together, as they shared a similar environment, as we would with many fishes throughout the rock record. But we don't. And these are worldwide patterns so they can't be caused by geographical isolation, as if they were transported worldwide, ecological zones would not be preserved due to the violent waters transporting them across a planet. 

Finally we have the TAB mechanism. TAB standing for Tectonically Associate Bioprovidences. Basically a TAB consists of multiple ecologic zones sitting on a chunk of a tectonic plate, and each plate has a certain tendency for sinking relative to each other. So TABs containing Cambrain-Ordivician Fauna were always on plates that were likely to sink first, followed by others ones, and so on. Oh boy, where to begin...well for starters, this doesn't make much sense. There's no logical reason why plates with trilobites would ALWAYS have to be the ones to sink before the dinosaurs. It's literally explained with ""God just wanted those animals to sink first."" Like, that's it. Scientific AF, I know. But furthermore, this model is just...God it's *terribly* flawed. Geologist Kevin Henke lists the numerous issues with it [here.](http://blog.theleagueofreason.co.uk/reason/kevin-henke-tackles-john-woodmorappes-tab-flood-sorting-mechanism/) Tl;dr, Woodmorappe couldn't even get basic fossil orders right and made contradictory maps and charts when trying to make this model. He doesn't know what makes a good index fossil so his analysis is even worse off. He ignores the use of fossil assemblages. He provides no real evidence for his model, only presenting the fact that there's slightly more tectonically altered sediments lower down but ignoring the effects of erosion in this pattern AND ignoring that the ""lower segment"" he maps out is over 150 million years longer than the upper portion, so that's not unexpected. He was challenged to apply this to a real basin but never did. On and on and on. I can see why places like AiG and ICR never recognize this mechanism and why it never caught on. If you do a literature trail of their journals it didn't seem to impress anyone or make much headway, probably because how ad-hoc it is yet how little it realistically explains. Until something more credible is brought forward I suggest just discounting this entirely. It's so garbage and so rarely referenced it isn't worth the energy. 

Now a lot of the times creationists will say that these criticisms mean nothing because they deal with things individually, not combined. This isn't true. Lets take the example of marine reptiles and whales. They're completely separated in the fossil record, despite having shared similar environments. This is something neither ecological zonation, hydrologic sorting, or differential escape would produce; after all neither could flee to higher ground, they lived in the same environments, and they had a wide range in body size and shape. No matter how you combine these factors you aren't going to somehow get them to segregate. It just doesn't add up. This goes for many other fossil assemblages as well. 

Hope this is useful to someone. This is hardly an exhaustive list of the problems with these mechanisms. ",16,17,1533874154,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/963ofv/regarding_flood_sorting_mechanisms/

DebateEvolution,95wubb,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,Defend Sanford.,"I would like to for someone to defend John Sanford.

For those who aren't familiar, Sanford is a geneticist and young earth creationist. His creationist claim to fame is the concept of ""genetic entropy,"" which biologists call ""error catastrophe."" 

He wrote a book on this, aptly titled ""Genetic Entropy,"" and it's bad. Really bad. 

The science is bad enough, and you can read about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7sbiop/more_experimental_refutation_of_this_genetic/) if you are so inclined. 

But I want to look at Sanford's *conduct*, specifically the possibility that he is either extremely dishonest or woefully uninformed regarding the topics in his book. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, let's look at how Sanford misuses a figure by [Motoo Kimura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoo_Kimura). Kimura's contribution to evolutionary biology is [neutral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution) (and really, his should be a household name like Haldane or Gould). 

Sanford uses a figure from Kimura's work that shows the distribution of fitness effects of mutations, slightly modified. [Here is Sanford's figure](https://letterstocreationists.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kimura-diagram_w-benef.jpg?w=960&amp;h=731). 

As you can see, there are *almost* no beneficial mutations shown here. In Kimura's original version, there were literally no beneficial mutations, because he purposely omitted them. In his own words:

&gt;In this formulation, we disregard beneficial mutations, and restrict our consideration only to deleterious and neutral mutations.

This is because Kimura's work was on *neutral* evolution. He's making a point by not showing things that will be selected for. He's *not* saying such mutations don't happen. Just ""we're not going to show them here, because I want to focus on this other set of mutations.""

But about this figure, Sanford says:

&gt;In Kimura’s figure, he does not show any mutations to the right of zero – i.e. there are zero beneficial mutations shown. He obviously considered beneficial mutations so rare as to be outside of consideration.

There is no way to give an honest reading of Kimura's work and arrive at that conclusion. 

So we're left with the question of whether Sanford is misrepresenting Kimura's work, or hasn't read it, despite basing so much of his own work on this single distribution. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, let's look at some of the only actual data Sanford presents: The supposed extinction of H1N1 due to ""genetic entropy."" He has [a whole paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/) on this, and [I love how terrible it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7uldw6/rcreation_is_now_butthurt_that_the_747_junkyard/dtl6qzd/).

He makes the same argument in his book, but uses an additional figure: A graph showing the decline in H1N1 fitness during the 20th century. It's super simple: the y-axis is fitness, the x-axis is time. Easy. 

Except...you knew there was going to be an except...the original figure, from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9652423) ([pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.327.2581&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) doesn't show ""fitness"" on the y-axis, or even ""pathogenicity,"" which Sanford incorrectly conflates with fitness. It's ""%Excess P&amp;I Deaths Among Persons &lt;65 Years of Age."" In other words, it's the fraction of flu-attributed deaths among people less than 65 years old. 

Considering how specific a reference this is, and that Sanford went through the trouble of reproducing that figure, but changing the axis label, one has to wonder. Does he not realize there's a difference, or is he dishonestly manipulating the data? 

&amp;nbsp;

So, would anyone like to defend Sanford? And I mean specifically defend his use of Kimura's distribution and/or these influenza data. I don't care that he's a world-renowned geneticist. I don't care that he invented the gene gun. I don't care that he something something Smithsonian. I don't care how nice/humble/generous/whatever her is. I'm sure he's lovely. Don't. Care. Defend his conduct in these specific instances, if you can. ",38,56,1533824513,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95wubb/defend_sanford/
DebateEvolution,95qgr8,apophis-pegasus,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Would this be a sound arguement for evolution?,"I used this in a discussion over at r/Creation 



We know animals, even animals of the same species have individual differences.

We know that not all animals survive to reproduce in nature (or even in captivity).

We know that the ones that do tend to have some trait/s that helped them survive (ran a little faster, his a little better, etc)

We know that these traits are caused or influenced by hereditary- traits that can be passed down to offspring.

Therefore, groups of organisms (species, Clans, etc) will eventually change to have more advantageous traits than not over successive generations. These changes can be anything that has a hereditary base. Enough changes can even create drastically different looking and acting organisms than the ones before e.g. dogs, corn, etc.

Now:

We know shared genes means relatedness. The more genes you share, the more closely related you are. Thats how ancestry tests work, and paternity tests.

We know being related to someone means you share a common ancestor. You are related to your sibling by your parents, your parents by grandparents, etc. This works in every organism we see.

So with that in mind if you genetically test two different organisms and have them related to some degree e.g. a monkey and a cat, it will overwhelmingly mean they shared a common ancestor (as it has before), and we do know that over time a group of organisms can change over time in certain ways due to its environment, even in different ways to another group of organisms of the same species.

Ergo, it stands to reason, the monkey and cat had an ancestor species that changed in two different ways due to two different environments over enough generations to form a cat and a monkey.",10,3,1533765162,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95qgr8/would_this_be_a_sound_arguement_for_evolution/

OP /u/PaulPriceCMI visits the sub to introduce the following topic:

&gt; It seems the online world suffers badly from the 'Echo Chamber' effect, where people generally are only exposing themselves to sources of information that feed them what they expect and want to hear (self-insulation). **Particularly difficult for creationists is getting any evolutionists, or old earthers for that matter, to be willing to actually read what the other side is saying and deal with the evidence.** Does anyone have thoughts on ways to overcome this?

The thread sparked a discussion on what the difference is between educating the masses vs convincing scientists (and is still ongoing).

Most interesting snippet (imo) is shown below, I recommend reading the whole thread.

&amp;nbsp;

___

A:

&gt; I think you should start by convincing scientists. If you can convince biologists that evolution is not the best explanation for the evidence, the public would follow.

&gt; **This will be difficult because evolution *is* the best explanation.** If creationists are right, though, that would be the best way to convince the world.

OP:

&gt; That's a very elitist attitude, isn't it? Actually convincing the public is of infinite value since people are making spiritual decisions that effect eternity, not just their temporal lives, based on wrong ideas about origins being pushed by establishment sources. **The fact is that that 'big science' is never likely to admit they were wrong and creationists were right.**

A:

&gt; From a certain perspective, I suppose it might be. **If you can't convince experts in the field that you're right, however, why should the public be convinced?** In all cases that I can think of, public opinion follows expert opinion.

OP:

&gt; Well simply because **the truth is not dependent on the consensus of so-called 'experts'**, which is subject to change for many reasons having little or nothing to do with the strength of evidence. **The reasons people choose to believe what they do often have more to do with personal reasons and groupthink than they do the actual evidence.**

A:

&gt; That's fair, but there's no similar ideology driving acceptance of the theory of evolution, at least not to the same extent. Rather, it seems to me that **creationism is much more likely to be ideology-driven, with the proponents having strong religious reasons to find a certain conclusion.**

OP:

&gt; Evolution is a great example of groupthink in action. The majority of scientists don't actually work on evolution directly, but they **take it on faith because they're told it's the consensus view** and they don't feel qualified to challenge it. **There is more than sufficient evidence now to convince the scientists, but it is not doing so because they are not open to changing their minds.**",23,130,1533752343,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95ojv5/echo_chamber_rcreation_has_a_discussion_about/

It states that, regarding the origin of life, there are three popular explanations:

* Special Creation
* Extraterrestrial Origin
* Spontaneous Origin

Of these three, the authors claim that only the third, Spontaneous Origin, is ""*scientific*""--that is, it is the only one that can be tested and potentially disproved.

So far, it has never been tested, at least not successfully. Pasteur's **Law of Biogenesis** still rules the day. Life *always* springs from life. Not only have we not observed life spring into being spontaneously, we have not succeeded in creating life from lifeless chemicals at all, even by applying our best intelligent design to the task.

So, at this time, Spontaneous Origin fails the requirement of testability.

If you are a reader that agrees with the authors, could you offer a test for falsifiability?

I claim that Spontaneous Origin is wholly and patently unscientific.

DebateEvolution,947dk9,eternaldarkness22,,,self.DebateEvolution,,A debate about mutations,"I originally posted this in r/DebateAnAtheist, but they told me to post it here better, so here we go. 

 First, i hope i can have a decent debate without pointless downvotes or being made fun of or people responding before reading my whole post, thanks.

So i want to have a debate about evolution and mutations in particular. What triggers mutations ? Most people say they're random, but in evolution they're shown to never be random AT ALL.

For example, we have in these sources ( Robin J. Wotton, "" The Mechanical De-sign of insect Wings"", Scientific American, v.263, November 1990, p.120) .... (Pierre-Paul Grassé, Evolution of Living Or-ganisms, New York, Academic Press, 1977, p30). That dinosaurs evolved their wings by trying to catch flies and after a certain period, a mutation occurred and they evolved their wings to be able to survive.

Another examples is how Giraffes evolved their long necks to be able to reach tall trees and eat in order to survive.

Another example is the beetles of Madeira Island. Because they live in a stormy island, air always pushes their wings and throw them in the sea, when a mutation makes it without wings, it’s chance of survival is better.

Do you notice the common thing here ? Mutations happened for a REASON. In the first example they evolved their wings to be able to catch flies and survive, in the second their evolved their necks to be able to reach high trees and survive, in the third they completely deactivated some genes to be able to survive. That's completely against how mutations are random. It seems to me like it's a Japanese anime or something, when the protagonist face a problem, he tries to change the impossible through his willpower and summon the hidden powers inside him, which is laughable. Mutations are extremely rare, like 1 in 10 thousands. Also 99% of mutations without a doubt are harmful and destroying, like Cancer, Anemia, Alzheimer, diabetes, some other stuff like Progeria which makes kids’ faces like old men, dawn syndrome, people like the elephant man, Mediterranean fever, dwarfism, albinism and lots of other really bad diseases and syndromes. Mutations are mostly errors, just random errors. It happens during the natural processing of DNA copying, but the errors have very low chances to actually happen, because there’s a mechanism in the genes that fixes the errors that happen. There’s about 1 million error and 1 million fix in just 1 day. And despite that mechanism, some errors still happen sometimes. These are mutations, they’re harmful, disfiguring, destroying, weak. And they mess with the DNA to change what they change.

The genetic information which are being copied in the DNA are like the lines that are written by a typewriter over and over, the mutation is a typographical error happens during the copying process and result in distorted lines, they say that these distorted lines are the reason of all beauty in the world and nature nowadays. But disfigurement can’t explain anything, except one thing, DEATH.

So in order for a good mutation that helps any species to overcome a certain situation in the perfect time, is IMPOSSIBLE. We're talking here about a 0.0000001% chance or something. You can't take this mechanism and prove evolution with it because it's extremely unlikely to happen.

Actually it's impossible in most cases because mutations CAN'T add new info to the DNA, they can only mess with what's already exist. I know you'll say that duplication and copying of genetics can occur, but it's still isn't going to explain anything.

If i have a gene X with Y number of info and it was copied and now i have another gene x with y number of info. The same number of same info has increased, but there's no new DIFFERENT info added at all. and if it was duplicated and became XX, it'd a new gene with more of the same info, so nothing special. The same mutation that could have occurred in the original gene would occur in the copied or duplicated one and the same result would happen. I can have one of my genes duplicated and then mutated and i'll still not grow something new because mutations can't add anything new as it's not a magical wand. LUCA had 345 gene and humans have 20 thousands genes. No matter how many of LUCA's or any other species' genes duplicated or copied and then mutated, they'll never turn to be another species as the info and genes in different gene pools are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Mutations can't change this fact, you can't add what you don't have and you can't have info out of nowhere.

If you give me a wooden box, i can reform it in another form, but it'll still contain the same amount of wood, but i can't suddenly summon my magic wand and then abra kadabra the box to be painted in red without actually adding anything by myself.

tl;dr : Mutations are extremely rare, random and harmful in most cases, so in order for them to actually be responsible for the beauty we witness everyday in life, the chance would be too small that it's mathematically impossible.

P.S : There's another stupid theory here [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160629-giraffes-did-not-evolve-long-necks-to-reach-tall-trees](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160629-giraffes-did-not-evolve-long-necks-to-reach-tall-trees) that giraffes evolved long necks with stretching them, which is extremely stupid of course as you can't pass the info in your Somatic cells to your offspring, only the ones in your germ cells.

DebateEvolution,940ko9,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity “Research Paper” #6: “Climbing the Steiner Tree—Sources of Active Information in a Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Euclidean Steiner Tree Problem ”, in which Dembski complains about a genetic algorithm.","So here we go, “paper” #6 from BIO-Complexity ([pdf](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2012.1/BIO-C.2012.1)).

This paper is all about a genetic algorithm used to solve for a Steiner Tree. A bit of background before we get into it: A Steiner tree is a network of lines and nodes where they meet (interchanges in this paper) connecting pre-specified coordinate points via the shortest possible path. Back in 2006, the authors over at The Panda’s Thumb [issued a challenge](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/08/design-challeng-1.html) (read that, you’ll see some names familiar to r/debateevolution) that involved Steiner trees: Solve the problem with an algorithm, and also have people do math to solve it, then have creationists identify which answers where which. 

Of course, none of them could tell the designed (i.e. solved by people) solutions from the evolved (i.e. generated by the algorithm), so they (Dembski specifically) responding by arguing that the information to solve the problem was “front-loaded” into the algorithm. 

&amp;nbsp;

This charge takes two forms. The first is that the answer is specifically and explicitly present in the code. This was absurd on its face, so they fell back to the second form of the argument, that the structure of the code itself dictates that a specific results *must* occur. So even if the solution isn’t explicitly stated in the code, it is still “designed” when it is generated due to the programmer designing the code in such a way that a specific outcome is predetermined. 

This paper is an attempt to elaborate on that second form of the objection, specifically with regard to Dave Thomas’ algorithm (Thomas is the author of the Panda’s Thumb piece linked above).  

So let’s get into it. 

&amp;nbsp;

The specific challenge issued to Dembski et al. is to identify the specific part of code that provides the solution. In other words, specifically identify the “front-loading”. The authors identify two specific pieces. 

The first ensures that there are at least two interchanges in the network connecting the points. The second specifies that no mutations cause tne number of interchanges to go below two. 

The claim is that these two pieces of the code contain all of the information necessary to solve the problem. 

But that’s wrong, and the data *in this paper* show that that’s wrong, because they generate lots of different potential solutions, some better and many worse than others. 

All that these two components of the algorithm do is establish fitness parameters in addition to the overall “shorter path is more fit” selective pressure. It also contains the parameter that 1 or fewer interchanges is extremely low fitness. So you never see those potential solutions. *That’s it*. Really. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is a bunch of stuff in there about recombination, but it isn’t relevant. The purpose was to identify the parts of the code in which the solution to the problem is front-loaded. The two pieces identified as such do nothing of the sort, and the data generated *by the authors* show as much, in that they generate not one optimal solution, but many solutions of varying fitness. 

So this is a huge swing and a miss for the creationists. And you have to laugh, because it’s a response to a blog post from *six years earlier*, and in all that time, the creationists arguments didn’t improve at all.

DebateEvolution,92cvvr,BreaksFull,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,How does YEC proponents pack all of human history into 4000 years?,"YEC's tend to date Noah's flood as being in the early 2000's BC. They also insist that all of modern humanity is descended from Noah and his descendants. Are there even any attempts to explain how Noah's descendants would have had to basically sprint across the four corners of the earth, stopping every so often to found new civilizations and cities (what a fertility rate!) then develop a sophisticated sea-faring capacity to zip across the oceans to also inhabit the Americas, Australia, and the Pacific in general? While also speed-evolving into a plethora of various ethnicities?

It's all absolute nonsense of course. Even putting aside the insane logistics and population growth required to spread humanity to every corner of the earth in a matter of decades, you also have to hand wave away the complete lack of cultural artifacts in common, since it would stand to reason that a people that spread out so quickly from a common location would be broadly similar culturally even if God did Babel-ize their languages. 

Again, it's all nonsense. But do YECs ever try and address this?

DebateEvolution,92cg27,Alexander_Columbus,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Scientific illiteracy,"Yes. I am aware of the No Antagonism rule. 

No. This thread is not meant to antagonize people. 

What I want to discuss is the lack of knowledge the anti-evolution crowd has. Yes. There are folks here looking at and posting what they believe to be scientific sources. But what this so-called debate comes down to is people who properly understand the mechanics of evolution and those who have not taken the time to understand it. This has always struck me as disingenuous. If you're a young earth Creationist Christian and someone said to you, ""Well, I would NEVER be a Christian because of all those Romans that Jesus murdered."" Your first and very correct instinct would be to say ""What are you TALKING about!?!?"" Jesus never murdered Romans and anyone who says he did is betraying a deep illiteracy of Christianity. You wouldn't stand for that. It's inane. It's untrue and you shouldn't have to devote any time or effort ""defending"" this claim. And yet folks who understand Biology spend so much of their time explaining the basics against claims that effectively amount to the equivalent of ""Jesus murders romans"". 

Topic for debate: the anti-evolution crowd wouldn't be the anti-evolution crowd if they understand evolution properly. This isn't meant as a pejorative or to antagonize. Please don't take it as such.

This led to one of the most hostile evolution arguments I've ever had, not with a Creationist but with a fairly large ""pro-science"" account.

While I thought I had clearly articulated my argument and I tried multiple times to clarify my point and to resolve the disagreement this account just resorted to re-state the original claim again and again, called me ""ignorant"", a ""moron"", and a ""piece of shyte"" before finally blocking me. 

The closest to an ""argument"" I got from this person was that  WE SHARE AN ""APE-LIKE"" COMMON ANCESTOR"" with monkeys and that ""MONKEYS ARE A MODERN SPECIES - THEY DID NOT EVEN FUCKING EXIST WHEN OUR ANCESTORS SPLIT"". Both claims are clearly wrong.

/u/stcordova has asked a very relevant question that I think would be nice to discuss here as well.

Two things first:

* Since this is supposed to be a biology related subreddit, I want this discussion to be about evidence for creationism, **not** a discussion about religion. Please leave those to a minimum, thank you.

* This question was posed and discussed here several times beforehand, here are the relevant threads. Basically, the question on what we would count as evidence for creation directly correlates with evidence we already have on creationism (None). If there is none, the evidence that would count isn't there. Or not here *yet*.

DebateEvolution,8zmi88,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity ""research article"" #5: ""A Stylus-Generated Artificial Genome with Analogy to Minimal Bacterial Genomes."" This is not in any sense a research paper.","We're back with the fifth of BIO-Complexity's so-called ""research papers,"" and this one...isn't. 

It's ""A Stylus-Generated Arti cial Genome with Analogy to Minimal Bacterial Genomes"" ([pdf](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.3/BIO-C.2011.3)).

All this is is a description of how the authors used a progam called Stylus to create an artificial genome. That's it. They argue in the (very short) discussion that this has implications for evolutionary biology because in encoding a short bit of text in the artificial genome and genetic code, they demonstrate the complexity of a minimal genome. 

That's it. ""We built a thing."" Great. But this isn't, in any sense, ""research"". There's no question being asked, no hypothesis being tested, no data analysis. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do want to hone in on one paragraph in the discussion, because it gets in to *other questions*, questions that are not the topic of this paper, but interesting questions nonetheless. Here is that paragraph (bottom left of page 12):

&gt;Whatever the origin
of these low-level processes of genetic causation may have been,
their physical operation today depends only on the molecular
systems now implementing them. This of course makes the
study of molecular biology as we now see it entirely legitimate
and feasible as a discipline in itself, wholly uncoupled from
questions of origins. But the reverse is not at all true. Evolutionary
causation is intrinsically tied to the relationship between
genotype and phenotype, which depends on low-level genetic
causation. It follows that evolutionary explanations of the origin
of functional protein systems must subordinate themselves
to our understanding of how those systems operate. In other
words, the study of evolutionary causation cannot enjoy the
disciplinary autonomy that studies of genetic causation can.

Basically, the authors here argue that we can't separate evolutionary explanations from how *extant* genetic systems operate, implying that this is the case *even if they operated differently in the past*. Which is a bit of a problem: Some well-supported evolutionary explanations involve systems that are either no longer present in extant life or are much less prevalent than thought to be in the past. Replication via ribozymes, for example. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that's all I have to say about this one, which isn't much. Because there just isn't much here.

The first is: ""How can we trust dating methods if we know they are not 100% accurate?"" I told him that there was a certain margin of error in dating methods, and he pounced on this and said that if we can't know with absolute certainty how old something is exactly, then we can't trust it at all. I then responded that I would rather believe something and be wrong by a 1% error than to be wrong by 99%, and he simply said that it doesn't matter because I'm still wrong either way.

The second is: ""How can dating methods tell us how old the Earth is if it was formed gradually?"" If the Earth was formed by accretion, bombardment from asteroids, etc. how can someone say it was 4.5 billion years old if that process took so much time in itself?

The third is: ""Who was the first human?""

I asked him why it was such a big problem if we can't say exactly who the first human was and he said that if we don't know how humans got here, then the whole ""theory"" falls apart.

**[Original thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8xqaw1/cross_species_transfer_of_genes_has_driven/)**

**[Original article titled ""Cross species transfer of genes has driven evolution""](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-species-genes-driven-evolution.html)**


___

TL;DR of the article:



&gt; Far from just being the product of our parents, University of Adelaide scientists have shown that widespread transfer of genes between species has radically changed the genomes of today's mammals, and been an important driver of evolution.

&gt; In the world's largest study of so-called ""jumping genes"", the researchers have traced two particular jumping genes across 759 species of plants, animals and fungi. These jumping genes are actually small pieces of DNA that can copy themselves throughout a genome and are known as transposable elements.

&gt; They have found that cross-species transfers, even between plants and animals, have occurred frequently throughout evolution.

&gt; ""Jumping genes, properly called retrotransposons, copy and paste themselves around genomes, and in genomes of other species. How they do this is not yet known although insects like ticks or mosquitoes or possibly viruses may be involved—it's still a big puzzle,"" says project leader Professor David Adelson, Director of the University of Adelaide's Bioinformatics Hub.

&gt; ""This process is called horizontal transfer, differing from the normal parent-offspring transfer, and it's had an enormous impact on mammalian evolution.""


That is from the article. Will there be *actual* criticism of the article, the paper or the findings? No. Will there be trashy claims with no real substance behind it? You bet:

___


&gt; Having proven common descent totally untenable, let us now consider Darwin's original theory that we did not actually descend from a common ancestor, but that we have been sharing genes with our cousins.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In any other ""science"" a discovery with this much widespread effect would demand the entire rewrite of our understanding of that field. Cosmologist go back to the drawing board for far less. Only in evolutionary biology do the facts never call for a rethink of the status quo just so stories.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Fascinating. A discovery which should falsify the idea of common descent is considered to have ""driven evolution."" Just another example of the many-headed hydra that is evolutionary theory.

When asked ""How should gene transfer ""falsify"" common descent?"" The answer by /u/nomenmeum is:

&gt; **It is the presence of genes that cannot be accounted for by common descent that falsifies the idea of common descent. Gene transfer is the ad hoc attempt to save the idea.**

Agree or disagree with that last statement of /u/nomenmeum? I feel like he has talked about horizontal gene transfer in this sub already but I might be wrong.

Anyways I'm sadly off to work but I absolutely *had* to post this beforehand because I already sensed from the beginning that the thread will be most likely filled with claims and a circlejerk rather than criticisms of substance. And behold it is already becoming true.

I hate to argue on the side of the creationists. But I think if everything was created, they could easily have been created with these bone structures.

Now there is one form of this argument that I may find convincing. If it can be shown that a species would be better off with a certain bone structure, but instead has the common one, you could then say that if they were created, the species would likely have the more perfect bone structure, but if they evolved, than the bone structure would have passed on.

A Mosquito even breeds at a much much higher clip than mammals do, not to mention they tend to pick up and transport a lot of blood from various organisms, increasing the potential for horizontal gene transfer from other species. 

And before you say that mosquitoes, for some reason, didn't ""need"" to evolve, what about all the gazillions of neutral mutations that should've occurred over the past 100+ million years?

I eventually figured we agreed and were just talking past each other, but he linked the discussion here so I thought it would be good if you guys could clear this up for me. I'm going to use an analogy about robots to explain the problem I'm having, if I'm wrong, thanks in advance.

I have blueprints for a robot, these blueprints are drawn out on a page on my desk. I will follow these blueprints to build this robot, the robot then, once it is built, will build another robot. It does this because of the way it was built according to my blueprint. The second robot then, will build a third robot. The third robot and the second robot then demolish and rebuild the first robot, each taking out exactly half the parts and each rebuilding half the parts. That new robot, made by 2 &amp; 3, in turn builds a fourth robot who then builds a table. Was my initial blueprint to build a robot, or a table? I don't have a blueprint for a table, I have a blueprint for a blueprint... for eventually a table. If I start changing the initial blueprint, the table is probably going to severely decline in quality, if not disappear. And you could understand why someone would be impressed by that complexity, because we would need a lot more than 5 steps for the formation of humans.

[Here's the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8uwjam/william_lane_craig_is_currently_exploring_the/e1jsj7e/) 

I'm going to go through this line by line, because &lt;Italian chef kiss&gt;.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They used to say that genes determined traits.,.thats wrong.

I...uh...what? What else explains traits like...I don't know...eye color? Sickle cell disease? On and on and on. Now sure, we know more than we did a century ago, but genes very much determine traits, though often not exclusively. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;they claimed that there was no inheritance of acquired characteristics- wrong.

This is the common misunderstanding of genomic imprinting via epigenetic mechanisms as Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits. But that's not how it works. 

Lamarck was ""Parent acquires trait A, offspring has trait A.""

Imprinting is ""Conditions for parent lead to offspring having trait A."" So for example, embryonic development in a low-calorie environment can possibly contribute to more efficient lipid synthesis. But the parents don't adapt to low calories by having more efficient lipid synthesis and then pass that trait to their offspring. The offspring have different gene expression patterns due to earlier conditions. 

They're not the same thing at all. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed that there was no breaking of Weismann’s barrier - wrong.

I'm an evolutionary biologist and I had to look up what this is. It's from 1892 and involves concepts like ""germ plasma"". That explains why I'd never heard of it. Since the late 1880s, we've learned quite a bit. Like horizontal gene transfer. Surprise? Apparently. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They denied that adaptive mutations can be triggered by the environment - wrong.

No, that's actually correct. Adaptive mutations, specifically adaptive mutations, are not triggered by the environment. Some organisms have mechanisms that increase the rate of mutation or recombination in response to environmental stress, but they can't pick just the adaptive mutations. They just have more of them, so they're more likely to find an adaptive mutation. 


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They denied genes/traits can jump species laterally - wrong.

Transformation was first demonstrated by Frederick Griffith in 1928. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said all adaptive changes in nature happen by random mutation plus selection - wrong.

Plus recombination and gene flow, and regulatory changes if you're only counting changes within coding sequences in the original statement. And sometimes you don't need selection; a trait will persist due to drift and become beneficial later on. That's probably the most recent addition to this suite of mechanisms, and that's from the 60s.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed 98 percent of the genome was junk - wrong.

And this was when? 98% of the genome is non-coding. It's not a secret nor a surprise that a bunch of the non-coding stuff is functional. Jacob and Monod did their Lac operon stuff in the late 50s and early 60s, so by the time we got to sequencing the human genome, non-coding regulatory sequences were well documented. It's 85-90% nonfunctional, most of which is repetitive sequences derived from mobile genetic elements. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed that genes were selfish - wrong.

Kin selection, which has been demonstrated (my favorite example is ground squirrel alarm calling), basically validates the selfish gene perspective for some circumstances. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said dna is the only container of information - wrong.

What?

The first virus isolated was an RNA virus. The first genome sequenced was an RNA genome. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said dna could not change during the lifetime of the individual - wrong.

You mean...we thought mutations couldn't happen? Really? You sure about that?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I could keep going. There are tons of them.

By all means, keep going. This is fun. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; This is a group of clowns masquerading as scientists. They are nothing more than propagandists who work within a window of lies.

DebateEvolution,8u1ngc,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity ""research article"" #4: ""The Evolutionary Accessibility of New Enzyme Functions: A Case Study from the Biotin Pathway"". Or put another way, ""Let's Ignore Actual Instances of the Thing We Claim Can't Happen Actually Happening.""","We're back with number 4 in our series on the so-called ""peer reviewed"" intelligent design ""research"". This time we have a paper from Ann Gauger and Douglas Axe, who, for those keeping score, have each authored one of the other papers we've discussed, and as we'll see, will continue to pump out this kind of stuff. 

&amp;nbsp;

Today's paper is called ""The Evolutionary Accessibility of New Enzyme Functions: A Case Study from the Biotin Pathway"" ([pdf here](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.1/BIO-C.2011.1)). In this paper, Gauger and Axe describe two structurally similar but functionally distinct enzymes, and show that several, perhaps as many as seven, specific mutations are required for one to turn into the other. 

They conclude that ""this result and others like it challenge the conventional practice of inferring from similarity alone that transitions to new functions occurred by Darwinian evolution.""

Sure. Totally.

&amp;nbsp;

As you might expect, there are some problems here. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, something I've harped on before is creationists thinking, or seeming to think, that evolution has a target. That's what this experiment tests: Go from A to B. They purport to be evaluating the ability of evolutionary processes to generate novel functions, but only evaluate the pathway to a single, known function. 

Evolution doesn't work like that. It works by generating lots of diversity and seeing what works. 

if Gauger and Axe actually wanted to test that, they'd have introduced lots of random mutations and evaluated the results for *any* new biochemical activity, not the specific activity of the target enzyme. But then of course they use these results to argue that innovation *as a whole* is prohibitively unlikely. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, going from extant state A to extant state B isn't how evolution works over long timescales, which is what we're talking about here. It's common ancestor of A and B diverging into both of them in divergent lineages. So a better way to approach this question would have been to start with the consensus sequence for the MRCA between the two enzymes in question and go from there to generate the target sequences. That still has issues (see above), but it at least more accurately represents how evolutionary histories work than what they actually did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Third, we have actual, recent instances of changes that require this degree of complexity. 

One experimental example is a novel form of extreme resistance to the antibiotic cefotaxime due to no fewer than five mutations to the enzyme beta-lactamase. See [Weinreich et al. 2006.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16601193)

And of course my favorite, HIV-1 group M VPU, which acquired a completely new function compared to ancestral SIVcpz VPU, requiring at least four and as many as seven amino acid substitutions *without selection for intermediate states*, and all happening around (or since) the time HIV-1 crossed into humans about a century ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that's not all! No, the fourth, and biggest, problem here is that they ignore work that demonstrates the appearance of novel innovations on scales far beyond what this paper is concerned with. We've generated completely novel enzymes de novo experimentally via in vitro evolution. That's starting from random sequences, not even an enzyme family, template sequence, or known target to start with. 

And yet there they are, doing exactly what these authors claim is so unlikely we should question the validity of evolutionary processes as a whole. 

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, so that's the fourth ""paper"" from this ""journal"". Another swing and miss. 

&amp;nbsp;

BTW, creationists, I know you can see this. You spend a whole of time complaining about how we're so rude and don't want to argue about the actual science. Y'all don't seem to say about any of these threads. Feel free to chime in whenever.

Creationists/ID proponents say they were the products of a creative Designer who designed those creatures while considering the environments they lived in. (That's why leaf insects look like leaves, complete with veins and all.)

Saying ""evolution did it"", implies that the evolutionary mechanism somehow has a sense of aesthetics. It would mean evolution was ""intelligent"""" enough to be aware of the colors and textures of leaves and orchids, before matching the colors and texture of certain insects. 

But since evolution does not involve conscious intelligence, evolution posits that natural camouflage and some animals ability to blend into their surroundings ""just happened"" via evolution.

My problem is that there seems to be this view that evolution should also be considered a ''fact"". To me this is wrong. A fact is merely a observation. A theory is an explanation that ties together various facts and is then able to predict the outcome of future discoveries and other observations. Evolution does this to the point where it's not reasonable to doubt its explanatory power. However, it is NOT a fact. Fossil evidence are facts.  DNA genome testing are facts. Evolution is the theory to unite these and other observations in biology to the point where we have no doubt the explanation is true.

However, evolution by itself is not a fact, because it's not an ""observation"" I don't think it should be called that and I feel like calling it a fact undermines what evolution actually is, an explanation for all the observed facts that is quite consistent and tenable.

&gt; As stated by others, carbon date it first. If you get carbon above the background threshold, it isn't a million years old. They didn't do it because, like every other fossil being dated lately, it would have shown that it wasn't that old.

DebateEvolution,8rjubc,goccat5,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Why couldn’t the human beings and other living organisms have all originated from other simple primates?,"---------------------------------------------

Why couldn’t the human beings and other living organisms have all originated from other simple primates?
There are two illogicalities here:

------------------------------------------------
First: There is not one single evidence proving a major evolutionary development! By evolutionary development we mean; the transition of one species into another form of species. Scientists have never been able to verify or spot a single evidence on a transition from species to another and all of these are just mere speculations. So, how can an atheist choose to believe in a speculative evidence and deny our religion-based solid evidence?

--------------------------------------------------

Second: According to the “minimum gene set concept” no living organism, no matter how primary, can go below 200 genes. Nature Magazine stated in their issue dated 6-January-2006 that we could never go below the boarder of 397 genes. Energy production alone requires at least 6 genes, and if one single gene is missing the cell will not be able to provide any energy. Likewise each and every basic function requires a minimum number of genes. Scientists have found that mycoplasma is the most accurate living organism on earth; it has 468 genes and each one of these genes contains complex proteins that could be within the range of 1000 to 10000 amino acids.
Hence, if you have 3 billion specialized pieces of information – these pieces of information are imbedded inside the nucleus of each of your cells – to produce precise vital functions or even 11,000 pieces information; then you are facing a giant treasure of specialized information that has suddenly materialized.
Atheist fantasized that there were beings that emerged from a count of zero genes, but the theory of minimum gene set came to thwart this fantasy.
Obviously, all living organisms have emerged so functionally complex from the very first moment!

This is the article:[https://iconsofevolution.com/why\-darwinism\-is\-false/](https://iconsofevolution.com/why-darwinism-is-false/) it is from iconsofevolution.com:  


  
In *Why Evolution Is True*, Coyne claims that primary speciation was observed in an experiment reported in 1998. Curiously, Coyne did not mention it in the 2004 book he co\-authored with Orr, but his 2009 account of it is worth quoting in full:

“We can even see the origin of a new, ecologically diverse bacterial species, all within a single laboratory flask. Paul Rainey and his colleagues at Oxford University placed a strain of the bacteria *Pseudomonas fluorescens* in a small vessel containing nutrient broth, and simply watched it. (It’s surprising but true that such a vessel actually contains diverse environments. Oxygen concentration, for example, is highest on the top and lowest on the bottom.) Within ten days—no more than a few hundred generations—the ancestral free\-floating ‘smooth’ bacterium had evolved into two additional forms occupying different parts of the beaker. One, called ‘wrinkly spreader,’ formed a mat on top of the broth. The other, called ‘fuzzy spreader,’ formed a carpet on the bottom. The smooth ancestral type persisted in the liquid environment in the middle. Each of the two new forms was genetically different from the ancestor, having evolved through mutation and natural selection to reproduce best in their respective environments. Here, then, is not only evolution but speciation occurring in the lab: the ancestral form produced, and coexisted with, two ecologically different descendants, and in bacteria such forms are considered distinct species. Over a very short time, natural selection in *Pseudomonas* yielded a small\-scale ‘adaptive radiation,’ the equivalent of how animals or plants form species when they encounter new environments on an oceanic island.”46

But Coyne omits the fact that when the ecologically different forms were placed back into the same environment, they “suffered a rapid loss of diversity,” according to Rainey. In bacteria, an ecologically distinct population (called an “ecotype”) may constitute a separate species, but only if the distinction is permanent. As evolutionary microbiologist Frederick Cohan wrote in 2002, species in bacteria “are ecologically distinct from one another; and they are irreversibly separate.”47 The rapid reversal of ecological distinctions when the bacterial populations in Rainey’s experiment were put back into the same environment refutes Coyne’s claim that the experiment demonstrated the origin of a new species.",10,15,1528937976,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qxpax/creationist_attempts_to_debunk_observed/

Humans have about \~200,000 ERVs of which \~199,600 are shared in the exact same position with chimps. With evolution this is easily explained, the chimp and human share a common ancestor so all of their common ERVs have been passed down from that ancestor. However, with creation they couldn't have inherited these from the same animal because in creationism they don't share a common ancestor. So, each common ERV must have independantly inserted into the exact same position in both species. Let's find the chance of that happening.

There are approximately 3,000,000 places an ERV can insert into the human genome. That gives us the following chance of an ERV inserting into any given location.

1/3,000,000

By squaring 3,000,000, we get the following for the probability of two ERVs inserting into the exact same position in two different populations.

1/9,000,000,000,000

But humans and chimpanzees dont share just 1 ERV, they share 199,600, so by raising 9,000,000,000,000 to the power of 199,600 we get the probability of all 199,600 ERVs inserting into the same position in two populations.

1/6.3809316x10\^2,585,666

We do have to multiply by the 2,000,000 total ERVs.

1/3.1904658x10\^2,585,661

As we can see the probability that humans and chimpanzees are related, purely based on their shared ERVs is absolutely massive.

I am not and expert and may have made an error in my calculations. But I'm am quite certain that if I made an error, the real probability that humans and chimps are related is still quite huge.",23,30,1528857380,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qoxm1/endogenous_retroviruses_ervs_provide_a_strong/

So here we are for the 3rd of BIO-Complexities 15 (!) so-called research articles. But like the previous works, this one is nothing more than a response to and critique of someone else's work, rather than something genuinely new. 

&amp;nbsp;

The argument Douglas Axe makes in this piece is that even with neutral intermediates, accumulating all of the changes it would take to get a novel, complex (i.e. requiring 2 or more mutations) trait via a duplicated gene that changes via single-base substitutions would take too long. Specifically, anything requiring more than 6 mutations would take an unrealistically long time via neutral processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unsurprisingly, he relies on a number of...questionable...underlying premises to reach this conclusion. 

&amp;nbsp;

Problem 1:

&gt;Cells reproduce asexually by binary fission

Red flag. BIG red flag. BIG GIANT RED FLAG. 

We're talking about how rapidly different mutations can appear together in a single lineage. Like, how fast is it *possible*. And we going to use these findings to draw conclusions for evolution *writ large*. But we're going to omit *a major way new genotypes form*? No no no. 

Recombination, via sexual recombination or some form of horizontal gene transfer, is how you get new genotypes fast. [Take a look at this figure.](https://imgur.com/mKMf42s) 

In the bottom panel, each new mutation was appear within the lineage in which the previous has already occurred. 

But in the top, there is recombination, meaning the two mutations appear together much earlier.

Axe relies on the bottom for his calculations. Real life looks like the top, *even if it reproduces asexually*.

That alone invalidates Axe's findings, such as they are. 

&amp;nbsp;

But wait! There's more. 

Problem 2:

&gt;Genome size is stabilized by a balance between neutral duplications and neutral deletions.

Really? This is a *terrible* assumption. Genome compactness generally decreases with complexity, and most eukaryotic genomes are full of non-functional, often-repetitive sequences, indicating that there is *not* balance between neutral duplications and deletions; the duplications are much faster. These neutral regions are in turn important sources of genetic novelty, allowing lineages to explore many variants of a sequence simultaneously. 

Axe argues that the energetic cost of maintaining a bunch of neutral sequences is high enough that selection would favor a constant genome size, but this would only be true in practice if there were no other traits experiencing stronger selection. And that’s giving him a pass on that initial claim, which is questionable.

Now again, this paper is ostensibly about bacteria, but the findings are used to draw conclusions about evolution *as a whole*, which means we need to consider organisms beyond prokaryotes. The infamous Behe and Snoke (2004) did the same trick, with the same pitfall. 

&amp;nbsp;

One more.

Problem 3: 

If the population is larger than the number of sites in the genome, the argument he makes at the bottom of page 1 onto the top of page 2 falls apart. Especially true if duplication puts many copies of the gene of interest into each genome. Now the population size is not representative of the number of “tries” to “find” each mutation. Axe’s calculations ignore this, even though he purports to be looking at the evolution of paralogous genes, i.e. genes that arose via gene duplication. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s number 3 from BIO-Complexity. Another example of math that doesn’t reflect the real world being used to argue the real world doesn’t work. 

If there was a “three strikes” policy for bad research, BIO-Complexity would have been out of business by the end of 2010. ",17,14,1528746300,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qcdm8/biocomplexity_research_article_3_the_limits_of/

**[Link to thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8p5loa/does_it_ever_feel_disheartening/)**


Thread starts off batshit insane from the get go, including some incredibly bold claims that just have to be discussed.

___

OP:

&gt; Does it ever feel pointless, or do you ever feel pressured to think your skepticism of the mainstream view is ridiculous? I'm struggling with that right now. From friends to family [...], everyone is constantly calling Creation lunacy, and saying that anyone who believes it shouldn't have any position if power at all. It sometimes feels like I should just give in and accept the mainstream, even though I know that's wrong. It's just really hurtful to be so ostracized from people I enjoy in my beliefs, and knowing that they might hate me if they knew. Does anyone ever feel the same?

How society deals with creationism (and science denialism in general) is a hot topic right now. From flat earthers to anti-vaxxers to global warming deniers, I think we can all agree that some form of anti-intellectualism is thriving. How we can combat that is a question of politics, education and sociology. Meaning that it's not just up to scientists to actively ""solve"" this problem. Lots of people from all kinds of sectors have to help out.

So in that regard, OP opens up a valid question, no doubt about that. How do people with fringe opinions react to being ostracized? Probably not by abandoning their fringe opinion, at least not as a direct response. It just doesn't work that way.

My only opinion here is that we as scientists have to be *real* about the facts first, and everything else comes second. What does this mean? Be respectful if you can, but that doesn't mean we have to give creationism any validity. It doesn't deserve any. Just respectfully explain that it is *pseudoscience*, everything else would bee too lenient.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, let's get to the comment section.

___










First guy basically holds a sermon and tells OP to just do what he loves and keep praying:

&gt; Hang in there, read the Bible, believe what you read, listen to good sermons and surround yourself with people who love the truth.

Sounds cute, but imho if you want to combat scientific facts, you do so by combating it scientifically, something creationists fail to do on a ~~daily~~  ~~weekly~~  ~~monthly~~  yearly basis.

Giving OP feel-good messages is exactly what I expected. Then obviously some people have to answer with bible quotes about oppression etc:

&gt; ""Then he said to the disciples, ""Anyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God, who sent me.""


Are we finished with the biblical references? Nope:

&gt; History has many instances of people being ridiculed for standing up for what's right... For starters: Jesus.

I'm personally fine with these feel-good comments. Just don't act as if you're arguing this topic on an eye-to-eye level with scientists. You aren't. You're preaching.

&amp;nbsp;


Then we come to the part were creationists try to make this an issue of creationism/atheism and having no faith, which is of course ridiculous:

&gt; What theistic evolutionists fail to realise is that evolution is incompatible with morality. Many Atheists acknowledge that without God, morals are completely arbitrary, and the honest ones will admit that this is why they like it. There is an agenda that goes with evolution to be free of accountability to a Creator.

Somebody else says exactly the same:


&gt; The Bible never said that it was going to be easy. It does say that you will be persecuted. The main struggle is people having to accept the authority of God.


Again, the same:

&gt; Just remember that those who hate the idea of the existence of God have an overwhelming motive to ridicule and dismiss the views of anyone who argues that there is evidence for creation. For them materialistic neo Darwinism must be true, there is no other game in town that can rescue them from God. [...] The world will always hate those who believe, that's something that we sign up for the day we come to faith.


When he is asked ""How do you explain theistic evolutionists?"" he says:

&gt; People who haven't done a whole lot of research and/or don't want to get in fights.

Yes, that is a *real* answer. Theistic evolutionists apparently don't really exist. Even when they are biologists.



&amp;nbsp;


**Yikes, is anything of substance coming?** As of yet, no. Here are the comments that at least try to make an argument of some sort:

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Having a different view than the mainstream is never easy in anything. The more we learn about science and the more we learn about genetics, the more information we have.

The good old narrative of ""the more we learn, the more we're drifting away from evolution!! I swear bigly, this time for real!""


&gt; I was recently thinking the same thing as you, with the recent post in here about 90% of animals having a genetic eve ~10000 years ago gave me a surge of hope.

Some nice misunderstanding of a paper sprinkled into the mix. Not only is that a simplified, false summary of the paper, but it's also not 10k but 200k. How very careful.












Somebody else figures out that evolution is being pushed because Big Evolution owns everything:

&gt; That's peer pressure. And yes, everyone who doesn't go with the herd gets that. Especially on this topic. Scientists and 'scientists' are held in high esteem, their supporters are in the government, media, education and give out funding. Going against the words of that many bigwigs amounts to societal heresy.

Wow really makes u think. All big evolution scientists are in universities and teaching in school and educating themselves and are held in high regard and take all the nobel prizes and publish all papers and do science and discover new stuff. WTF why is my local pastor not getting funds to build his ark??



Another guy manages to be self-aware:

&gt; There are some ideas that are so bad that if you land on them, you're critical thinking, intellectual honesty, and problem solving are all brought into question. Many people consider creationism to be one of those items.

Agreed.

But this comment takes the cake:

&gt; One last thing. A friend of mine works for a Government department and processes lots of health stats in his job, including fertility stats and the monitoring of populations. **He built a model that showed that the current world's population is indicative of what we should expect if we were all descended from the eight people on the Ark, and confirms the Biblical timeline.**

No he didn't. Lmao. Also I would really like to see what he did. Please tell us more, /u/DadLoCo.

Or rather, let's do this for each blog post published by the not-at-all-peer-reviewed creationist web magazine BIO-Complexity. That's more accurate. 

This is the in-house publication from Discovery Institute, and began publishing in 2010. Since then, they have published a whopping *15* pieces under the heading of ""research article"".

So let's see what the best and brightest ~~creationists~~ ~~cdesign proponentsists~~ design proponents have to offer. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first piece they published was the topic of the thread linked above. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8ofk62/lets_address_this_paper/e036xt3/) for my thoughts. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we'll talk about number two here: [""A Vivisection of the ev Computer Organism:
Identifying Sources of Active Information""](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2010.3/BIO-C.2010.3) (pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

The argument made in this paper is that evolutionary algorithms ""frontload"" information, so when they generate something new, it isn't actually demonstrating evolutionary processes resulting in novel information or complexity.

The authors investigated a specific program, ev, to illustrate their objections, but they are often applied elsewhere in other contexts. 

I'll note that I'm not a computer scientist, so some of this is beyond my area of expertise. So I'll focus on the evolutionary aspects rather than wade into the nitty gritty of the computational aspects. 

So let's see what the purported problems are with this program, shall we?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The perceptron structure is predisposed to generating strings of ones sprinkled by zeros or strings of zeros sprinkled by ones. Since the binding site target is mostly zeros with a few ones, there is a greater predisposition to generate the target than if it were, for example,
a set of ones and zeros produced by the flipping of
a fair coin. 

Not all types of mutations are equally likely. Treating all mutations, and therefore all potential sequences, as equally likely does not reflect biological reality.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;When some offspring are correctly announced as more fit than others, external knowledge is being applied to the search and active information is introduced. As with the child’s game, we are being told with respect to the solution whether we are getting “colder” or “warmer”. 

That's...how natural selection works? Mutations introduce variation that is either better or worse (or often about the same). Can't fault the evolutionary algorithm for operating the same way. It's kind of the point. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Two queries contain more information than one. Repeated queries can contribute active information.

I'm not *quite* sure what the objection is here, but I think it's one of two things. One is that these algorithms should not evaluate the same ""mutation"" or ""sequence"" more than once, which is silly since convergent and parallel evolution are things that happen, so the same things pop up repeatedly, and that's well documented. The second interpretation is this structure means it can be many generations before something useful appears, and that's unrealistic. But rampant junk DNA shows that this isn't a valid objection. Stuff hangs out, even if, for example, it costs energy to maintain. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This process discards mutations with low fitness and propagates those with high fitness. When the mutation rate is small, this process resembles a simple Markov birth process that converges to the target. 

This is how selection works. The problem is the assumption that there is a built-in, predetermined target. The correct way to say this is the term ""fitness peak"". Iterative rounds of selection and mutation lead to a fitness peak. It's only a target if you know what it is beforehand and discard anything that moves you further from it. This objection amounts to ""this program simulates natural selection!""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As seen in Figure 3, the degree of mutation for ev must be tuned to a band of workable values. 

The plain english translation for this is ""if the mutation rate is too high, it doesn't work"". 

No. Shit. That's why every DNA based organism has lots of error checking and correcting mechanisms, and the only things that can use RNA are tiny viruses. 

&amp;nbsp;

So. 

The objections to this particularly evolutionary algorithm are that it models selection and mutation. And the parameters are more or less representative of how these processes work and are constrained in nature. 

Scandalous, right?

Around 3 months ago, I posted [this picture](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7wc3n0/to_creationists_who_dont_believe_that_there_are/) to /r/Creation with the question:

&gt; ""To creationists who don't believe that there are any transitional forms between ape and man and that man was created in it current form, **how do fossils like this one fit into your worldview? Where do these creatures belong in your timeline?**""

I posted a picture of an Australopithecus sediba.

For evolutionists and antrophologists, the story is clear. It's creature that lived around 2 millions of years ago and is supposedly a human ancestor. This was us 2 million years ago and every scientists with knowledge about biology should consistently come up with the same answer.

Keyword: consistency.

So I wondered, what about creationists who deny that there even exist human ancestors like this one? Or that there are no transitions? Will they be able to be consistent with their denial? Are creationists in agreement or are they just confused?

So without going that much into detail, the thread sparked lots of discussion and I noted down every response I got from YEC creationists about what this creature is. For every YEC, I tried to hunt down their opinion about what this creature is.

Remember, evolutionists aren't in disagreement. It's a *Sediba*.

Here it goes, with usernames redacted and answers shortened or modified to be shorter:

&gt; Australopithecus sediba is actually a Australopithecus africanus.

&gt; Bones of a still undiscovered ape species, but not a human one.

&gt; It's just an African monkey.

&gt; It's a human. There is significant variation in humans and animals.

&gt; Disease and poor nutrition and genetic mutation can significantly effect development. It might be a disfigured human.

&gt; It could be a human or a variety of ape.

&gt; It could also be just an ape.

&gt; Ape, not human, therefore created on day six before Adam.

&gt; It's a member of another class of great ape that probably went extinct shortly after the flood.

u/NesterGoesBowling said ""Except this doesn’t pan out in practice.

What they found instead was that cells \(bacteria in this case\) would shed the weak\-side activity significantly more often than they would preserve it, typically because weakly performing functions usually demand too much of an energy burden \(less efficient, therefore less fit\). Natural selection ends up working against you in this scenario.

Is it possible that evolution is being driven by some other underlying mechanism, quite possibly at the quantum level, as an expression of the universe in some way? Or in some other way such as how lateral and horizontal gene transfer occur?

It seems quite plausible that the evolutionary process is occurring.

It seems quite *impossible* that life spontaneously generated from amino acids and lightning bolts.

It also seems quite *impossible* that natural selection of materialistically incurred raw error alone is enough to build full genomes. May we assume genomes are akin to operating systems: we wouldn't assume an operating system could be built by generating random code and selecting bits along the way.

I will keep this one shorter this time. No need to repeat myself. In what is either a trolling attempt, or perhaps the saddest display of intellectual ignorance and deafness ever, the same small group of people that I called out in [my previous post 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8n2uiu/rcreation_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_again/) decided to spend the next day searching for similar topics and they came about this article:

Title: All sperm whales had a Mitochondrial Eve “tens of thousands of years ago”

Submitted by: /u/NesterGoesBowling

**Article abstract:**

&gt; Researchers recently found a “remarkable lack of diversity” among sperm whale populations. They were able to trace the mitochondrial DNA of more than 1,000 sperm whales back to a single female tens of thousands of years ago. They’re calling this individual “Eve.”

&gt; Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the maternal side and is useful for studying long-term patterns because it evolves slowly compared to other genetic markers.

&gt; “Sperm whales have been in the fossil record for some 20 million years, so the obvious question is how one maternal lineage could be so successful that it sweeps through the global population and no other lineages survive?

___

To repeat, what were the topics I talked about [in my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8n2uiu/rcreation_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_again/) about this same topic just 24 hours prior? A short summary:

1. The MRCA of mitochondrial DNA is not the descendant of the whole species, we only trace the mitochondrial diversity to a single female. Mitochondrial DNA = ~0.03% of the whole genome. No species has a common ancestor between themselves.

2. No, mitochondrial rates do not lead back to a human mitochondrial Eve around 6000 years ago.

So far so good? Let's see if we can find any regurgitated arguments in the new thread that haven't changed one bit... 

&amp;nbsp;

*^^^Yep, ^^^we ^^^will.*

/u/NesterGoesBowling:

&gt; Another check box in the Creationist prediction column.

&gt; Yet DNA analysis of more than 1,000 whales shows a common mother “tens of thousands of years ago.” (Again, to be fair, we’ll note that this isn’t proof of creation as it could be a population bottleneck, but the latter is much less plausible given the extremely short timeframe).

Again, still being completely oblivious about what a mitochondrial MRCA is. Yet he was one of the guys that was mentioned last time. Did he even read any of the responses?

And holy shit, somebody from there actually recognizes the problem (praise Jesus).

/u/ADualLuigiSimulator:

&gt; &gt;You’re claiming neo-Darwinism predicts all sperm whales share a common ancestor a few thousand years ago?

&gt; I thought the article mentions a whale mitochondrial eve, which is the matrilinear most recent common ancestor, not the common ancestor of whales

&gt; Modern whales never died out and have existed for around 20 million years:

&gt;&gt;""Sperm whales have been in the fossil record for some 20 million years [...]""

Some abstracts of responses to that:

/u/NesterGoesBowling:


&gt; Unless this sperm whale was the only sperm whale alive at the time, in which case the above two individuals are the same.

True that, but *if you understood that this isn't the case because the article doesn't claim that, you wouldn't repeat that dozens of times* at nauseam.

/u/NesterGoesBowling:

Ahh yes, some radiometric dating denial sprinkled on top of this discussion. Isn't it great that it isn't flawed then?

Moving on to some other comments:

/u/Dzugavili:

&gt; However, creationism fails to predict the rest of the genome: you have a mitochondrial eve, not the common source for all whale genetics.

&gt; Mitochondrial DNA doesn't recombine -- this leads to such situations where lines go extinct. However, nothing about this suggests mtEve was the lone female in her society.

Correct. Then again this is our own mod, so go figure, lol.

Now how long does it take until the discussion almost inevitably goes to Nathaniel Jaenson for no apparent reason? You're correct, not long:

&gt; You can call it throwing if you want, just sharing but clearly you’ve been over this. I don’t buy the “refutation” tho - that group of folks are dishonest, just plain mean, and intentionally misleading.

&gt; Somwhere else in the thread he also says:

&gt; I’m curious about the topic though I’m not a molecular biologist. But I don’t trust a lot of the conclusions out there because so often the materialistic bias pervades the reasoning (i.e., Common Descent must have occurred so any evidence or theories that suggest otherwise must be ruled out a priori).

And the obvious follow-up question (that he directly got) then is:

**Article: Sweeping gene survey reveals new facets of evolution**

**TL;DR:** There's different ways to analyze the genomes of different species to understand their evolutionary history (for example phylogenetic relationships).


For one, you can understand their phylogenetic history by comparing their 'nuclear' genome, or you compare their 'mitochondrial' genome.

There's several advantages to the second choice. Mitochondrial genes are highly conserved, so building (for example) phylogenetic relationships using gene trees works very well. It's similar to using ribosomal RNA for phylogenetic analysis, **except** you can utilize an awesome property of mitochondrial DNA that I will explain in the next paragraph. TL;DR: mtDNA of a species can give us some limited insight into the age of a population.


Mitochondrial DNA has another very interesting property. For one, mitochondrial DNA is only passed down by one of the parents. Because of it's a one-way inheritance, mitochondrial eve has the curious property of *potentially* being lost to its offspring, but completely separate to the rest of the genome that does get passed on. This fact means that mitochondrial DNA, unlike chromosomal DNA, actually has dead ends. In another way, it's like looking at a mitochondrial bottleneck within a population that is not experiencing a genetic bottleneck. In simple terms, mitochondrial DNA has a traceable most recent common ancestor, while chromosomal DNA doesn't. This is the case for every single sexually dismorphic species. Over time, the mitochondrial ""dead ends"" will accumulate, and the matrilineal (mitochondrial) most recent common ancestor will shift. This means that the position of mitochondrial eve shifts over time and is never one exact individual. It also means that mitochondrial eve has a very special meaning as the **mitochondrial** most recent common ancestor, but it's not a common ancestor of a species.

# [Mitochondrial Eve illustrated (important)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg/1217px-MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg.png)

[Full Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)

So in the article, they basically did this kind of analysis to come to a couple of conclusions. Analyzing around 100'000 animal species, they mostly emerged in the last couple of hundred thousand years. Note that this is *not* new or very surprising stuff. Here's some comments from the article itself:

&gt; ""The simplest interpretation is that life is always evolving,"" said Stoeckle.

Correct, ""new species emerging"" is a loaded term. It does not mean that the species *started* hundred thousands of years ago, it just means that the genome of the species in it's current form is only distinguishable as such for a range of time. Ya know, because they change over time... Kind of the whole point really.

&gt; ""It is more likely that—at all times in evolution—the animals alive at that point arose relatively recently.""

Simple but obvious point. Of course species that live now emerged recently. As long as you can specify ""recently"" this is as obvious as stating that guests in a restaurant that arrived later are probably less full than the guests that arrived earlier.

&gt; In this view, a species only lasts a certain amount of time before it either evolves into something new or goes extinct.

Correcto. This kind of cuts into the first quote. The more time passes, the more a species becomes unrecognizable to it's prior form.

Okay. So far so good. Article ends, ready for the comments in /r/Creation? What do you think? High quality? Thoughtful? Insightftul? Let's see.

/u/NesterGoesBowling

The idea here is that of all the species studied, each have a “Mitochondrial Eve” that lived about (supposedly) 200,000 years ago. To be fair, this could indicate animals that stepped off the ark, or animals that were created, or, as evolutionists prefer, just population “bottlenecks” for example in a mass extinction event like a plague etc., it might be that all survivors happened to share a great great grandmother etc.

Sorry, but this individual fell into the trap in which ...

* **[many](https://np.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/4n5xhk/creationist_confuses_mitochondrial_eve_with/)**

* **[creationists](https://np.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/58w08t/creationist_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_and/)**

... have fallen into.

Mitochondrial eve is not a common ancestor of a species *by definition*. It is, as I tried to explain, only the most recent common ancestor of mitochondrial DNA, which is merely a fraction of our whole genome. The rest of the genome doesn't (and can't) have a common ancestor because humans evolved in a continuous line of descendants.

&gt; Given how the dates of about 200,000 years are calculated based on expected mutation rates (and how similar dates of the “Mitochondrial Eve” of humans can be argued to support a 6,000 year timeframe)

Ah yes, this bullcrap again. This has been debunked several times over and at this point it's just stubbornness:

* [mtEve Was Not 6000 Years Ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7xnjgh/mteve_was_not_6000_years_ago/)

* [Creationist Claim: ""mtEve dates to 6000 years ago."" This is completely wrong.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6cn27r/creationist_claim_mteve_dates_to_6000_years_ago/)

&gt; it’s nice to see Creationist predictions being validated as science progresses (common ancestors thousands of years ago not millions)

I'm sorry to disappoint you buddy.

&gt; I’m sure this comment will get attacked as usual

Yup, you are getting a response. Except it's not going to be an attack, but a gentle reminder how real science works. Wrong information *needs* backlash.

&gt; but hey, the evidence is pointing away from the predictions of the dogma of neo-Darwinism, so you’d expect backlash from those who want to keep their faith in Materialism.

No evidence is ""pointing away"" here. What happened, and which is the case for 99% of these regurgitated discussions, is that creationists feel compelled to have an opinion about *everything* they see, even when they know nothing about it.

/u/allenwjones:

&gt; So basically life isn't millions of years old, all came about at the same time, and has distinct genetic boundaries?

&gt; There's something almost Biblical about this.. 🤔

Yeah, nope. I'm not even sure how anyone got this from the article. Life is not millions of years old? What? Where did that come from? All came about the same time? The article doesn't say that either. Distinct genetic boundaries? For phylogenetically separated animals? Sure thing, but I'm not sure this individual understands what this means.

DebateEvolution,8mkbs3,natehanby,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution implies that people should have four children or more or zero and that two-child families are a bad idea.,"Here is my logic:

Random mutations are usually deleterious.

The only way—with technology that is safe and widely available—of removing deleterious mutations from the gene pool is natural selection or some other kind of selection such as artificial selection or sexual selection.

The amount of selection that can be applied to a population is a function of typical family size. 

Examples: If you have a family with 8 children, and 2 of the 8 go on to reproduce, and the others don’t, then you have potentially 75% selection.  With 4 children, if 2 go on to reproduce, you have potentially 50% selection. With 2 children, they both need to reproduce or you aren’t breeding at replacement rate—so there’s no potential selection at all. If your family line follows this culture indefinitely--two child families--then there is no process by which deleterious mutations would ever be removed if you are breeding at replacement rate. 

If the deleterious mutation rate in hominids is 1.6 per diploid genome per generation, which it is according to [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/16915), then a simple computer model I have made shows that the amount of selection must be approximately 50% simply to remove deleterious mutations as fast as they arise naturally. Which implies that typical family size should be 4, dead minimum. Of course, there are benefits to more selection beyond the bare minimum. My model suggest that quality of life will be substantially higher for our future descendants if we follow a culture of having roughly 8 children per family, with 75% of people not having children. Also, due to uncertainties in the model, it is possible that having an average family size of 4 children is not viable long term either, although in this case it would probably take many thousands of years before it would manifest as a problem.  

My rough model estimates that a culture of 2 or 3 child families will result in a deterioration of our genes such that the child mortality rate will double in approximately 300 years as compared with a standard of 8 child families and high selection pressure. In approximately two thousand years, the 2 or 3 child family culture will not be viable at all, and family size must increase to beyond 3 children per family to make up for all the people dying or failing to reproduce due to genetic disease. Of course these numbers are very rough because the model by its nature must make a lot of arbitrary assumptions, and it is difficult to predict how much medical care will be available to the typical person in the far future, so it's difficult to pin down exactly how long it will take for a culture of 2 to 3 child families to become problematic. I wrote the model in Transact SQL--if anyone wants to see my scripts to look over them, let me know. Although if you can't read SQL it's just going to be gibberish...

From studying zoology, it is very hard if not impossible find an animal that does not follow this rule. Nearly all animals average 6 offspring or more during their lifetime if they are able to reproduce. The ones who go lower than this (6 offspring per individual) are mostly endangered species, like mountain gorillas. And as for the lower limit of 4, the only exception I could find is humans in industrialized countries in the past 50 years or so. There seems to be a fundamental genetic limit to the viability of K-Type reproductive strategies—and I believe that we are currently below this fundamental limit, and I believe this will cause us genetic problems in the future within historical timescales.

DebateEvolution,8mhnj5,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Quotes from creationists no. 5,"This episode of Quotes of Creationists is about Mike Behe. The one who propagates intelligent design and who came up with the concept of Irreducible Complexity - the idea that a some complex systems are composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.

YECs love Behe for this contribution to ""debunking evilution"".

Following their habitual custom of cherry picking, they pay no attention to the fact that Behe accepts common descent, including that humans descended from other primates, although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species. He also accepts the scientific consensus on the age of the Earth and the age of the Universe. So a few quotes of what Behe wrote himself:

&gt; For the record, I have no reason to doubt that the universe is the billions of years old that physicists say it is. Further, I find the idea of common descent (that all organisms share a common ancestor) fairly convincing, and have no particular reason to doubt it. I greatly respect the work of my colleagues who study the development and behavior of organisms within an evolutionary framework, and I think that evolutionary biologists have contributed enormously to our understanding of the world. Although Darwin's mechanism – natural selection working on variation – might explain many things, however, I do not believe it explains molecular life. I also do not think it surprising that the new science of the very small might change the way we view the less small.

*Darwin's Black Box, pp 5–6.*

&gt; For example, both humans and chimps have a broken copy of a gene that in other mammals helps make vitamin C. ... It's hard to imagine how there could be stronger evidence for common ancestry of chimps and humans. ... Despite some remaining puzzles, there's no reason to doubt that Darwin had this point right, that all creatures on earth are biological relatives.

*The Edge of Evolution, pp. 71–72.*

So Behe thinks that all species, including humans, share a common ancestry. He only thinks that the evolutionary process leading to new species, cannot be fully explained by Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms alone but also by god tinkering on the molecular level bits of complex pieces. 

Of which he hasn't a speck of evidence and only *assumed* by invoking irreducible complexity, which doesn't provide evidence for special creation but only shoots a hole in evolution theory - also a *yet* to be discovered, until now unknown mechanism could well explain very complex systems - and the whole idea of irreducible complexity has been shot in pieces as well.",16,17,1527426747,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8mhnj5/quotes_from_creationists_no_5/
DebateEvolution,8mbcji,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Response to ""Oops, our estimation was off by a BILLION years"" Thread","So [here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8l0keb/oops_our_estimation_was_off_by_a_billion_years/), via r/creation. Thank you to /u/xhf for highlighting an interesting paper, albeit one that significantly overstates the significance of its results. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before we go into the paper, a bit of background. We're talking about when the oxygenation of the atmosphere occurred, which has been dated to about 3 billion years ago (bya). Atmospheric oxygen is due to the splitting of water during photosynthesis by a protein complex called photosystem II, or PSII. It takes the protons and electrons in the form of hydrogen, ultimately generating O2 as a byproduct. There is another photosystem, photosystem I (PSI) that operates in a similar way, but doesn't generate O2. 

&amp;nbsp;

So in this paper, the authors performed coalescence analysis, which involves molecular clock analysis, on the PSI and PSII genes, to determine how long ago they split from each other, and they found that it was a really long time ago, maybe 4 bya. This is much earlier than expected, since oxygenic photosynthesis didn't appear until much later. 

So far so good. 

&amp;nbsp;

The authors get out over their skis when the say, therefore, oxygenic photosynthesis, and therefore atmospheric oxygenation, appeared much much earlier than we thought. 

Not only does the coalescence analysis not show that this is the case, but there are other, independent indicators of the timing of atmospheric oxygenation. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, why don't these findings support the broader conclusion? Because they show that the genes responsible for *what are now* PSI and PSII diverged about 4 bya, they cannot say that the ancestral PSII complex produced oxygen *at the time of the divergence*. They can *only* say when the split occurred. Which is interesting in itself, but not indicative of when atmospheric oxygenation occurred. 

Second, we have other ways to date oxygenation, because it had to work a specific way. THe organism that first produced oxygenic living in the oceans, because everything lived in oceans at the time. So the first thing that happens when O2 is released is it reacts with other things in the water, like iron. The iron oxides fall out of solution and accumulate on the ocean floor, resulting in banded iron formations.

Then the O2 dissolves in the ocean water. Once the oceans are saturated, *then* it begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. So by dating the banded iron, we put a hard ceiling on atmospheric oxygenation. It could have been a bit more recent, but it could not have been earlier. Period. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event#Timing) for a more detailed explanation.  

So that's what this paper does and does not show, and why.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, a quick word on the creationist take. The main response is that a billion years is an enormous error, so we can't trust any secular measure of the age of earth, life, etc. 

By way of analogy, the pro-science side says Mt. Everest is the highest point on earth. The creation side says it's Death Valley. Now we have a paper that claims it's actually K2, and OH MY GOD HOW CAN YOU TRUST ANY MEASURE OF HEIGHT. Silliness. 

The other thing is that this paper relies on coalescence analysis, which is a totally valid thing to do. Creationists seem to think that's the case...sometimes. When it makes us question when photosynthesis appeared, coalescence analysis is valid. When it shows that humanity is several hundred thousand years old, no no, can't trust that. Too many old-earth assumptions. But when those same data are manipulated into showing humanity is only six thousand years old it's good again. 

So maybe someone can clarify for me whether or not coalescence analysis is legit. That'd be great. 

Anyway, there's your rundown of an interesting but oversold study. As you were. ",23,108,1527353030,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8mbcji/response_to_oops_our_estimation_was_off_by_a/

If you are an evolutionist, then you are a naturalist^(1), and thus deny that any supernatural agent is or has been at work in our universe. I, on the other hand, am a supernaturalist.

One consequence of my supernaturalist presuppositions is that our God, who is the epitome of rationality, is thus the source of all rationality that exists in His creation. I believe that you and I both are only capable of rational thought because our thinking ability was endowed upon us by our rational Creator. But alas, that wonderful fact is compromised by our sinful and irrational rebellion against our Creator, with the result that we all too often think irrational thoughts and thus arrive at irrational conclusions.

You, on the other hand, claim that the thoughts of both you and me are fashioned by evolution, which is controlled by two processes: mutation and natural selection. Mutation is obviously a completely irrational process, since it is merely random, blind, undirected, purposeless modifications to DNA, the instructions that direct the construction and maintenance of the organism they inhabit. But it is equally true that natural selection is totally irrational; its goal^(2), as it were, is survival, not truth or rationality.

If you think that natural selection is somehow rational, consider the way you evolutionists explain the fact that most people believe in a ""higher power"" (i.e., god). You would say, as I have often heard other evolutionists say, that the false belief in a higher power somehow enhanced the overall survivability of the humans that believed it. Thus, natural selection enhances survivability, not rationality or truth.

But, dear evolutionist, beware: that explanation cuts both ways! According to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, your beliefs are also entirely directed by these same processes of random mutation acted upon by irrational natural selection. You believe in evolution for no more noble reason than that such a belief somehow enhances your survivability. Your mind dupes you into thinking that your thoughts are rational when in fact, according to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, you are thoroughly irrational, just like the believers in God that you discount.

No, all rational thought, thought that seeks and discovers truth independent of irrational natural influences, must have a rational cause. That cause cannot come from within the natural sphere, because that sphere is devoid of purpose, direction, or goal of any kind, including the search for truth.

But do not dismay, you are capable of rational thought! Happily, you are in error when you deny the existence of a superintending supernatural agent. However, in order to salvage rationality, you must acknowledge the existence of the supernatural agent that ultimately causes it. When you do this, you must introduce the possibility that this same agent is responsible for aspects of nature that resist naturalistic explanations: life's origin, the existence of information and dizzying complexity in the very basement footings of life, incredible fine tuning of the universal constants, unexplainable overdesign, the existence if fresh undegraded flesh in fossils supposedly a hundred million years old, carbon-14 in diamonds supposedly just as old, functional coherence that defies gradualistic explanation, gratuitous beauty, etc., etc.

###Summary

To summarize: your naturalistic presuppositions necessarily lead you to conclude that you are just as thoroughly irrational as your supernaturalist opponents. On the other hand, my supernaturalist presuppositions allow for both of us to think rationally, as we are both the creations of a rational supernatural designer.

^(1) You may ""believe in God"", but you do not allow that God to have any effective impact on the universe we inhabit (i.e., you are a deist). If you are a theist, then it is foolish of you to assume that God does not affect His creation, as methodological naturalism presupposes.

^(2) Natural selection is not actually goal-directed at all, but it does have the effect of enhancing survivability.

I have an issue at the way ABIOGENESIS is presented in college textbooks (BIO 101) .. typically there are many chapters on ""evolution"" and then maybe a blurb about ABIOGENESIS &lt;inferring&gt; that it stands the same weight in terms of scientific evidence and being generally accepted. It's misleading to teach a whole generation of students that abiogensis is remotely on par with the theory of evolution..

my argument is that abiogensis is actually a very weak ""theory"" and there is little evidence that a chemical process exists to turn inorganic componds into a living organism.. in layman's terms.. if it's a ""100 step process"".. current science has been able to figure out various steps like synthesize rna or create proteins essentially steps 5-7 and 24-32 or whatever but setting up a lab that will go from 0-100 is pure fantasy at this point.. and then the process of course had to have taken place in a natural setting . clearly we have all the available compounds but they can't do it.. and then a news story comes out that scientists have been able to do one of the building blocks and we are xpected to assume that the whole process is even possible.

will science ever be able to synthsize life? we have to consider the possibility that any attempt is just alchemy.. science will never turn lead into gold.

DebateEvolution,8iy4mc,CTR0,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Hello Everybody. I'm CTR0, One of Your New Resident Moderators. I'm Here to Discuss my Role and Raise a Discussion on Some Improvements I'd Like to See.","Hello everybody.

As the title says, I'm /u/CTR0, one of the new moderators selected from the recent moderator recruitment thread. I tend to hold the majority viewpoint held in this subreddit: that the Theory of Evolution is the best supported explanation for the diversity of species, and that abiogenesis (namely the RNA-World hypothesis) is the best supported explanation for the origin of life.

I am 22 years old, and my professional CV includes a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; being a lab manager and co-lead researcher for a 20 person joint-effort synthetic biology laboratory; and, where I'm currently at, a post-baccalaureate fellowship in a genetics laboratory.

My moderation history dates back to middle school, where I played way to many video games. Namely, I jumped between several Minecraft servers up through high school in positions ranging from regular old moderator to server admin. Currently, my moderation duties include /r/Science, where I am a comment moderator (I'm one of those guys that deletes fun over there), and now here.

My lab tends to keep me pretty busy, but if you're inclined, my hobbies include playing the guitar, hiking, D&amp;D, Magic TCG, programing (python), and online gaming. I want to get into running, and my passions in conducting science extend into science advocacy and outreach.

My role here is also one of a comment moderator. I'm here to approve comments that shouldn't have been automatically removed, take down spam, etc. I intend to largely refrain from actively taking down non-spam comments (a significant portion of non-regulars violate these, but they are needed to keep discussions active), but anything that's purely antagonizing (IE personal attacks, ""You're just a fucking idiot, go read a science book,"" or ""You only reject god because you want to sin/be a bad person,"" largely things subjected to rule one while also not furthering the discussion of whatever the specific topic is) and does not contribute to continued discussion will be removed. In rare cases, I may comment on discussions violating other rules, but will leave final decisions to more senior mods.

Simply speaking, I would like this subreddit to remain an open and inviting place to discuss (with at least minor civility) evolution related subjects, both for and against. As part of this, there are two additions to the subreddit that I would like to see. *As a new moderator, I'm obviously not in a position to change subreddit policy. These changes are not planned for the near future, but I feel like this post would also be a good place to have a discussion on these subjects.*

* **The encouragement or enforcement of using NP links when linking to external subreddits.** While members of this subreddit don't actively say ""Go downvote this,"" often we provoke discussion by linking to opposing viewpoints in other subreddits (most commonly /r/Creation). Often, these linked threads will have positive votes before being linked from here, and negative votes after being linked from here, which I find to be [borderline vote brigading](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or), and I feel like it contributes poorly to the sub's reputation. It looks like, at least in the case of /r/Creation, they have used CSS to disable voting, but there are ways around that. A common one, Reddit Enhancement Suite, encourages people not to engage in discussion if they visit a NP link. Out of the respect for autonomy of other subreddits, I think that we should encourage or enforce the usage of these when linking to external subreddits. This could be through a community effort (say something when you see it), through automod (the automod could comment reminders automatically), or through a hardline stance of removing non-NP link containing comments and posts. Personally, I feel like the removal of link-only-posts and an automated reminder comment on text-posts and comments would be the best approach to this.

* **CSS Styling** Old reddit is bland. New reddit is generic. I'd like to see this subreddit get a unique look. This one is definitely more open ended, and I'd love to hear ideas in the comments. I don't know how to code reddit CSS, but there are communities out there to help and I'm open to learning (that's what /r/CTRs_Playground is for, actually).

With that, let me know if you have any questions about myself, how I intend to operate, or comments and discussion on NP links and CSS for the subreddit.",16,38,1526151543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8iy4mc/hello_everybody_im_ctr0_one_of_your_new_resident/

DebateEvolution,8idxqp,OlympicRunner,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"If the most important part of Evolution is random, how is the process not random?","According to the modern theory, new traits appear in organisms through random mutations. The best trait that benefits survival/reproduction of organisms are then selected to thrive relative to the rest. How is this not random?

Take for example a lottery example. You have a 1 in a million chance of winning the lottery. The winner is chosen who has the correct digits. Is the whole process of the lottery then not a random process? Remember that evolution does not know what the ""correct"" digits are. It is not working toward an end goal.

In the same way, natural selection may select the best trait AFTER it arrives by chance, but can do nothing to help that trait develop. State differently, natural selection helps survival of the fittest, but can do nothing to ensure the arrival of the fittest.

The development of new traits and differences that are beneficial to the organism are at the core of evolution. And as we know, evolution is unguided. 

Therefore I ask again, is evolution a random process?",0,86,1525949145,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8idxqp/if_the_most_important_part_of_evolution_is_random/
DebateEvolution,8iae8q,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Quote from creationism no. 4,"The one who has the dubious distinction to make his appearance this time on my list of creationist quotes is Henry Morris, who wrote:

&gt; The mean reason for insisting on the universal Flood as a fact of history and as the primary vehicle for geological interpretation is that God's Word plainly teaches it! No geological difficulties, real or imagined, can de allowed to take precedence over the clear statements and necessary inferences of the Scripture.

This leads to curious scenes on the stage where creationists put on their plays. Especially when some of them get exposed to the world of reality of geological data and observations. How those fare Glenn Morton can tell, who once found himself in this position. Let Morton [do the talk himself](http://www.oldearth.org/whyileft.htm) and I would like to include his testimony rather integrally, with some minor, unimportant texts left out to really get the picture:

&gt; For years I struggled to understand how the geologic data I worked with everyday could be fit into a Biblical perspective. Being a physics major in college I had no geology courses. &lt;...&gt; After six months of looking, I finally found work as a geophysicist working for a seismic company. Within a year, I was processing seismic data for Atlantic Richfield.

This was where I first became exposed to the problems geology presented to the idea of a global flood.  I would see extremely thick (30,000 feet) sedimentary layers. One could follow these beds from the surface down to those depths where they were covered by vast thicknesses of sediment. I would see buried mountains which had experienced thousands of feet of erosion, which required time. Yet the sediments in those mountains had to have been deposited by the flood, if it was true. I would see faults that were active early but not late and faults that were active late but not early. I would see karsts and sinkholes (limestone erosion) which occurred during the middle of the sedimentary column (supposedly during the middle of the flood) yet the flood waters would have been saturated in limestone and incapable of dissolving lime. It became clear that more time was needed than the global flood would allow. &lt;*broken links left out*&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; One also finds [erosional canyons buried in the earth](http://www.oldearth.org/Deltain3d1.gif). These canyons would require time to excavate, just like the time it takes to erode the Grand Canyon. 
&gt; 
&gt; I worked hard over the next few years to solve these problems. I published 20+ items in the Creation Research Society Quarterly. I would listen to ICR, have discussions with people like Slusher, Gish, Austin, Barnes and also discuss things with some of their graduates that I had hired.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to get closer to the data and know it better, with the hope of finding a solution, I changed subdivisions of my work in 1980. I left seismic processing and went into seismic interpretation where I would have to deal with more geologic data. My horror at what I was seeing only increased. There was a major problem; the data I was seeing at work, was not agreeing with what I had been taught as a Christian. Doubts about what I was writing and teaching began to grow. Unfortunately, my fellow young earth creationists were not willing to listen to the problems. No one could give me a model which allowed me to unite into one cloth what I believed on Sunday and what I was forced to believe by the data Monday through Friday. I was living the life of a double-minded man--believing two things.
&gt; 
&gt; By 1986, the growing doubts about the ability of the widely accepted creationist viewpoints to explain the geologic data led to a nearly 10 year withdrawal from publication. My last  young-earth paper was entitled Geologic Challenges to a Young-earth, which I presented as the first paper in the First International Conference on Creationism. It was not well received. Young-earth creationists don't like being told they are wrong. The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!
&gt; 
&gt; John Morris came to the stage to challenge me. He claimed to have been in the oil industry.  I asked him what oil company he had worked for.  I am going to let an account of this published in the Skeptical Inquirer in late 86 or early 87.  It was written by Robert Schadewald.  He writes,
&gt; 
&gt; ""John Morris went to the microphone and identified himself as a petroleum geologist. He questioned Morton's claim that pollen grains are found in salt formations, and accused Morton of sounding like an anticreationist, raising more problems  than his critics could respond to in the time available. He then said that the ICR staff is working on these problems all the time.  He told Morton to quit raising problems and start solving them. Morton chopped him off at the ankles.  Two questions, said Morton: 'What oil company did you work for?'  Well, uh, actually Morris never worked for an oil company, but he once taught petroleum engineering at the University of Oklahoma.  Second, How old is the Earth?' 'If the earth is more than 10,000 years old then Scripture has no meaning.'  Morton then said that he had hired several graduates of Christian Heritage College, and that all of them suffered severe crises of faith. The were utterly unprepared to face the geologic facts every petroleum geologist deals with on a daily basis.  Morton neglected to add that ICR is much better known for ignoring or denying problems than dealing with them."" 
&gt; 
&gt; It appeared that the more I questions I raised, the more they questioned my theological purity. When telling one friend of my difficulties with young-earth creationism and geology, he told me that I had obviously been brain-washed by my geology professors. When I told him that I had never taken a geology course, he then said I must be saying this in order to hold my job. Never would he consider that I might really believe the data. Since then this type of treatment has become expected from young-earthers. I have been called nearly everything under the sun but they don't deal with the data I present to them. Here is a list of what young-earthers have called me in response to my data: 'an apostate,' (Humphreys), 'a heretic' (Jim Bell - although he later apologised like the gentleman he is), ""absurd"", ""naive"", ""compromising"", ""abysmally ignorant"", ""sloppy"", ""reckless disregard"", ""extremely inaccurate"", ""misleading"", ""tomfoolery"" and ""intentionally deceitful"" (John Woodmorappe), 'like your father, Satan' (Carl R. Froede--I am proud to have this one because Jesus was once said to have been of satan also), 'your loyality and commitment to Jesus Christ is shaky or just not truly genuine' (John Baumgardner in a Merry Christmas card), ""[I] have secretly entertained suspicions of a Trojan horse roaming behind the lines..."" Royal Truman, 'a compromiser' (Henry Morris).

And there we have our henry Morris Again. Morton ends his testimony with:

&gt; But eventually, by 1994 I was through with young-earth creationISM. Nothing that young-earth creationists had taught me about geology turned out to be true. I took a poll of my ICR graduate friends who have worked in the oil industry.  I asked them one question.
&gt; 
&gt; ""From your oil industry experience, did any fact that you were taught at ICR, which challenged current geological thinking, turn out in the long run to be true? ,""
&gt; 
&gt; That is a very simple question.  One man, Steve Robertson, who worked for Shell grew real silent on the phone, sighed and softly said 'No!'  A very close friend that I had hired at Arco, after hearing the question, exclaimed, ""Wait a minute. There has to be one!""  But he could not name one.  I can not name one.  No one else could either.  One man I could not reach, to ask that question, had a crisis of faith about two years after coming into the oil industry.  I do not know what his spiritual state is now but he was in bad shape the last time I talked to him. 

This a rather disturbing testimony I must say.",12,15,1525907897,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8iae8q/quote_from_creationism_no_4/
DebateEvolution,8i36ij,Metamorphone,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Fusain still sinks the Flood,"Over at /r/Creation /u/Br56u7 posted this explanation from Tas Walker on why ""Flood Deposits contain abundant charcoal:

&gt;Charcoal forms from woody material that experiences elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Conditions during the Flood would have been suitable for forming charcoal. Coal measures frequently include deposits of volcanic ash, and this would have elevated the temperatures. Coal itself is formed from vegetative material that has been exposed to elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst, such as volcanic ash, and in the absence of oxygen. It is a chemical reaction and has been studied in the laboratory. As you say, charcoal would not be from the pre-Flood world, but there are many examples where it is formed post-flood.

There is so much wrong with this. First off fusain (fossil charcoal) has been experimentally demonstrated to be identical to charcoal made by **wildfires.** To quote [AA Scott:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929) 

&gt;In all physical aspects fusain is identical with wood charcoal...Charcoal cannot be distinguished from fusain microscopically.

The experiments referenced used charcoal made in a lab to demosntrate charring as a mechanism. However the fusain physically resembles wildfire charcoal. Walker is proposing some sort of underground mechanism that would work to make charcoal like we make it artificially. This doesnt explain its physical resemblance to wildfire derived charcoal, nor does it make sense. Charring requires removal of water, and this is not possible underground it waterlogged flood sediments. But then there's this part:

&gt;Conditions during the Flood would have been suitable for forming charcoal. Coal measures frequently include deposits of volcanic ash, and this would have elevated the temperatures.

This does not work, not only due to the whole fact that flood sediments would be waterlogged and not allow charring, but because lava and ash are not found associated in many huge fusain deposits. Some are, but many are not, which means Walker's mechanism does not explain the evidence. In fact, fusain is found in all sorts of deposits, Scott stating:

&gt;Charcoal is found in a very wide range of facies, from peats (Cohen et al., 1987; Rollins et al., 1993) 1997) to lake sediments (Millspaugh and Whitlock., 1995), alluvial fan deposits (Meyer et al., 1992), fluvial and floodplain deposits and marine sediments.

Also, take [this paper by Nichols and Jones.]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1992.tb02129.x) They found evidence of a truly massive charcoal deposit. Using a bare-bones minimum estimate, in which they deliberately underestimated the volume of charcoal, they still concluded that to produce such charcoal, a wildfire **bigger than modern day Ireland must have occurred**, and this estimate is likely too small by two orders of magnitude **at the least.** They found NO associated ash or lava in any deposit, leading them to conclude it was ignited by lightning. It is not possible the evidence of it just vanished. This carboniferous deposit alone falsifies Flood geology. 

Tl;dr: Walkers explanation does not work. It doesnt make sense physically, and lacks evidentiary support in very problomatic deposits (I wonder why 🤔). Neither does Sniper Lightning, BEDS which contradict ecological zonation, or the other crap I've heard slung at this issue.

DebateEvolution,8i2luu,preferpaleo,,,self.DebateEvolution,,14 Challenges to Evolution,"Hey guys, I responded to a person's post on instagram in which there was an image of skeleton, with the caption, ""Still waiting for 1 example of macroevolution."" I proceeded to show him some observed speciation events and the conversation went on from there.
I mentioned to him that he could ask me any questions he wanted. He proceeded to direct message me a series of slides (some of which are old and bad creationist arguments) with 14 challenges to evolutionanry theory by an istagram account ""jackavalone."" However due to personal events that have recently gone on in my life, I have not had time to properly respond to these 14 challenges. It has been almost a month since he has sent me these messages and so I decided to make this post and ask for your responses to them. They will probably be better than I could have answered with.

1. ""Evolutionists usually talk about small differences in creatures, but the claim of evolutionary theory is enormous- the invention of every form of life that exists or ever ever existed on Earth without using any intelligent guidance. The small differences are called, 'microevolution' but that is not evolution it is variation. Every creature has litmits to how much it can change or adapt- limits to its variation. Disease bacteria has mutations constantly and become resistant to drugs, but they always remain bacteria. 'Macro-evolution,' big change, is what the theory of evolution is about.


2. To get past the limits of variation mutations are supposed to provide information to build new organs. But all known mutations result in the loss of information. There are cases where such loss has selective advantage in certain situations, and disadvantages in other situations. Certainly, no new structure is invented. A short-circuit in a computer is like a muation in DNA, and no-one would expect to upgrade their computer that way.

3. Every structure and function in and function in a creature takes more than one change to 'invent.' It must be in the body-plan of the developing embryo, must differentiatiate stem cells into the proper tyype, must be able to receive nutrients, do waste removal and repair, must have nerves and muscles or other devices linked to a control center, and must integrate with the other elements of the biological system. If all these changes in the DNA do not happen randomly at the same time, it is impossible for a new, working organ to be made.

4. There should be many more transitional creatures in the fossil record than distinct species, many times more. But there are none- not even Archaeopteryx.

5. If life did not begin by chemicals coming togerther, there could be no evolution. Specialists have been working for 60 years on how this might have happened, and all they can produce ""naturally"" (without laboratory equipment and techniques to isolate and concentrate chemicals) are some of the many nucleotides and amino acids. They cannot make cell walls, RNA, DNA, ribosomes, organelles, cytoplasm, or cilia of even a cell or bacterium in a natural environment. After 60 years they have nothing to show but speculation and eternal hope. It is hard to prove a negavtivem but these origin-of-life specialists have come close. What we learn from their work is that life cannot arise on its own from chemicals and thus there could never be evolution.

6. Evolutionists make charts showing supposed ancestral lines of descent. They call these 'trees of life.' The problem is, different genes make different 'trees of life,' and there are tens of thousands of different genes.

7. Evolutionists are oten forced to invoke the ""parallel or convergent evolution"" fudge wheneber the same new organ appears on unrelated creatures in the fossil record. It is not an explanation, it is an excuse.

8. In every taxanomic group studied so far, around 10 to 30% of the genes are so-called 'orphan genes' becasue they are unlike genes in any other species. They are not modifications of genes from supposed ancestors; they must have formed spontaneoulsy, 'de novo'. That was formerly assumed to be impossible, and for good reason. It is essentially an admission that the foundation of evolution theory, descent with modification, is falsified. The only way to describe the existence of these genes is miraculous.

9. The Second Law of Thermodynamics requires all natural processes to become more disordered over time. It prevents the invention of new organs by mutations, becuase without a constrcution system already in place, things naturally fall apart- they don't get more complex.

10. The Law of Biogenesis (life only comes from life) has never been seen to have been violated. But evolutionists believe it must habe happneed, and maybe more than once!

11. DNA is made of only right handed versions of nucleotides, while protiens are made of only left-handed versions of amino acids. Yet any random chemical reaction that produced nucleotides or amino acids would make an equal mix of left and right-handed versions of each. Even if the thousands of nucleotides or amino acids needed to form individual DNA or protein molecules were able to combine from this mix, they would be a jumble of left and right-handed versions that could not function at all. This is the problem of chirality for evolution theory.

12. The minium number of genes needed for an organism to survive is probably 200 to 300. Most bacteria have 1000 to 4000 genes. And there are at least 17 basic things necessary for a cell to function, which must be wokring or it cannont live.

THis is the minimum LEVEL of COMPLEXITY that must be met for a cell to exist:

Replication
Recombination, and
Repair
Transcription Cell cycle control,
Mitosis, and
Melosis Defense mechanisms Cell wall/membrane
biogenesis
Signal transduction mechanisms intracellular trafficing
and secretion
translation
Post- translational modification,
Protein turnover,
Chaperones Energy prodcution and conversion
Carbohydrate transport and metabolism
Amino acid transport and metabolis
Nucleotide transport and metablims
Coenzyme transport and metabolism
Lipid transport and metabolism
Inorganic ion transport and metabolism 
Secondary metabolite biosunthesis, transport, and catabolism

13. Evolutionsts have to beieve that each protien, pure chance laoid out long strings of amino acids that fold themselves into the exact shapes needed to interact with other specialized proteins and, wjere needed, get help from chaperone proteins which themselves appeared by chance The necessary porteins cannot be invented one at a time. Either they are all there, ready to work together or nothing happens and they disintegrate. Yet even if it could design proteins, mutation-natural selection would only work on one ata time, sporadically, over many years

14. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) build and operate all living things. There are gene regulatory networks for everyhting that happens, and some networks control other networks in a chain of command. The interactions within these netwroks are so complex that attempts at mapping them quickly degenerate into mazes of interactions. Random mutations cannot produce any complexity, and this super-extreme complexity is in ebery living thing. Bottom line: Macro-evolution is physically impossible. It cannot happen; it has never happened. It is up to evolutionists, the ones making the claim, to prove otherwise.

So here the 14 challenges (sorry for any typos, I had to type every single one). I will send the guy a link to this, so that he can see the responses.

&gt;He noted that they were ""unearthed by a competent geologist, Ragazzoni ... and examined by a competent anatomist, Sergi."" Still he could not accept their Pliocene age.

""Now, if they really belonged to the stratum in which they were found,"" wrote Macalister (1921, p. 1854, ""this would imply an extraordinarily long standstill for evolution. It is much more likely that there is something amiss with the observations."" Macalister (1921, p. 185) also said: ""the acceptance of a Pliocene date for the Castenedolo skeletons would create so many insoluble problems that we can hardly hesitate in choosing between the alternatives of adopting or rejecting their authenticity."" Here once more we find a scientist's preconceived ideas about evolutionary influencing him to reject skeletal evidence that would otherwise be considered of good quality.

DebateEvolution,8hb4c0,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,The Castenedolo fossils,"So it's about time that we provide /u/Cucked_Liberal a taste of his own medicine.

&gt; Castenedolo fossil

Now let's apply the criteria /u/Cucked_Liberal and Cremo issue to scientific work, **SHALL WE**, /u/Cucked_Liberal? 

&gt; When you can only go by verbal testimony, then the accuracy of it is based on reasoning of the testimony and the trustworthiness of its expounders.

All VERBAL testimony in Cremo's book about the Castenedolo fossils. Next.

&gt; And the trustworthiness of scientific papers is vitiated by a financial incentive. 

The Castenedolo fossils were found and examined by professional paleontologists like Ragazzoni.

&gt; Even if you have some physical trace left behind, there is no way to know that it's referring to the event described in the document, because those traces can be caused by something else. 

The Castenedolo fossils are the physical trace of the old age human fossils appear to have in Cremo's eyes this appearance can be caused by something else.

&gt; It's very easy to make claims like that. Scientific papers are only claims, and no proof.

Cremo's book section on the Castenedolo fossils are claims and no proof. He got them from Ragazzoni. Ragazzoni's scientific reports are claims and no proof.

&gt; Not always possible to investigate. The fossil is actually removed from the dig site and taken back to the lab for testing. Hence, it's all witness testimony and the entire field of paleontology and archaeology is reduced to baseless claims. ""I found this fossil in this strata."" 

Not always possible to investigate. Ragazonni took away the fossil from the Castenedolo site **and even threw it away** (Ragazzoni, 1880. p. 121), to ""his own regret"". Hence, it's all witness testimony and the entire work of Ragazonni and Cremo is reduced to baseless claims: ""I found this on the Catenedolo site"".

&gt; And pictures and videos can be misleading and there are rooms for mistake. Lighting, bad camera angle, blurring, someone standing in front, etc. 

Ragazonni made several drawings from the Castenedolo fossils. This can be misleading: the harsh winter weather he was reporting when retrieving the fossil must have plagued him.

The section about Castenedolo fossils in Cremo's book contains two figure: no. 6.4, depicting one of the skulls found at the sire and no. 6.3, a section of the Colle de Vento, near Castenedolo, drawn by Sergi. 

Pictures and videos can be misleading and there are rooms for mistake. Especially I think these ones are phony and full of false interpretations. This also applies to *all* pictures in Cremo's book. Not by purpose but just because people like Sergi and Ragazzoni can make mistakes.

&gt; In fact, this field has the most amount of hoaxes because it's so easy to fabricate data. 

So it does for Ragazonni who worked in that field.

&gt; How do I know scientists who observed speciation are telling the truth? Or that they found a fossil in some strata?

How do I know that Ragazonni found his Castenedolo fossil in Middle Pliocene strata?

&gt; That's a claim the dig site is still there. No proof it actually is. Its also possible it can be destroyed. 

I think the Castenedolo site is not there any more. It's probably destroyed. No proof it actually is.

&gt; But there is no proof that the fossil came from that strata. It has been documented that scientists have delusions, hallucinate, make contradictory claims, hide data, etc.

But there is no proof that the Catenedolo fossils came from that strata. It has been documented that scientists like Ragazzoni have delusions, hallucinate, make contradictory claims, hide data, etc. etc.

&gt; People make mistakes all the time. Several studies show most papers published are junk science. 

So the ones by Ragazzoni, DON'T YOU THINK. He must have made an error, something like ""Oops I wanted to write late Pleistocene but accidentally wrote Middle Pliocene.""

&gt; Not enough information it came from the strata. Also it does not provide as much knowledge as finding the fossil in-situ. 

Not enough information it came from the Middle Pliocene strata. Also Ragazzoni not Cremo do not provide as much knowledge as finding the fossil in-situ.

&gt; Do scientists cite other scientists' papers? If so, then they go by verbal testimony. 

Does Cremo cite scientists' papers? If so (HE DOES GALORE) he goes by verbal testimony.

&gt; There is zero chance I know some scientist found some fossil in some strata. Zero chance I know some scientist observed speciation in the wild, etc.

Including Ragazzoni, isn't it, who was a paleontologist. And found a fossil on the Castenedolo site.

What really bothers me, is AGAIN the *profound* dishonesty that characterizes EACH creationist.

Please answer the following questions &amp; provide the materials I’ve asked for.  I’m sure I’m not just speaking for myself when I’m getting frustrated by your lack of evidence for your claims.

1. You’ve stated that you believe that all creation occurred at once.  Correct me if I’m wrong but you know this from eternal scripture that is correct due to an [extremely long proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8fspjf/how_does_the_fossil_record_support_evolutionary/dycqxu0/) that we haven’t heard of in the west.  Where can we read this proof for ourselves and why haven’t western philosophers heard of a proof that would upset our worldview? Without providing this evidence your entire case is baseless.

2. Please provide the sources in Cremo’s book Forbidden Archeology that you’ve continuously referenced without sharing.  Furthermore provide the passages were he give an explanation for refuting more recent publications in archeology, including disputing Denisova’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8g74bb/outliers_gods_and_abiogenesis/dyero85/).

3. You’ve recently been claiming that [‘science is a fraud’](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8gwpix/scientists_historians_scriptures/dyfvggx/).  I don’t think anyone here has claimed science is perfect.  Everyone will tell you that it is influenced by bias, dishonesty, inept grad students, and the list goes on.  Humans are flawed. Therefore I’d welcome you to suggest a better method of studying the world around us.  Please do not claim scripture is the answer unless you’ve provided a sufficient answer for my 
first question. 

The body of knowledge that has supported the model of evolution is over 200 years old.  Yet the model has withstood everything thrown against it. As we’ve increased our knowledge base and ability to dive deeper into biology, geology, biogeography, stratigraphy, palaeontology just to name a few of the field based disciplines the theory has only strengthened. To claim that the last 200+ years of science has been entirely fraudulent is, well, for lack of a better simile, akin to saying the earth is flat.

I haven’t been keeping up with all of the ongoing conversations, so I’m sure I’ve missed some important questions, but I think it’s time you start defending your model rather than attacking the foundations of science.

DebateEvolution,8gwpix,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Scientists &gt; Historians &gt; Scriptures,"This is specifically to address the claims made by /u/cucked_liberal, ragarding the accuracy of scriptures, historical documents, and scientific papers. Specifically, he states the following:

&gt; So do your scientific papers, they only make claims. Here we go again, do you simply not understand?

&gt; Verbal testimony can be proof, because people are known to say true things. For example, what the weatherman says is accepted as true, what historians say is accepted as true. If I'm in a forest and a forest ranger says there is a fire going on, then it's evidence there is a fire.

&gt; Whether a verbal testimony can be considered evidence or not depends on the trustworthiness of the individual making the statement. And there are several ways to establish the trustworthiness of someone. For example, if someone says someone says somethings which are confirmed later on, then trust in him increases. Other ways are integrity, honesty, desire for truth, being considerate of others, having good/humane qualities, etc. All increase the trust in someone.

&gt; If verbal testimony wasn't proof, then you wouldn't be referring to papers in which scientists claim to observe things or claim to do experiments as proof. That is just hypocritical.

The fact is, not all verbal and written testimony is equal. As the title of this thread suggests, scientific papers are generally more valid than historical records, which are more valid than scriptures.

To borrow a term from Cucked, there are a number of ways we can determine a written accounts trustworthiness. The following would make a piece more trustworthy:

1. The author presents solid reasoning for their conclusions. Lots of detailed analysis, weighing multiple possible conclusions to determine the best ones.

2. The findings can be repeated.

3. The evidence is available for others to examine.

4. The author did not have motivation to lie. For example, a subordinate for a cruel king or dictator would be likely to embellish the claims of his superior.

5. Multiple sources can confirm the findings. This is especially important if the multiple sources were unlikely to have colluded, or influenced each other's bias. For example, if ancient Greek records were able to confirm what ancient Egyptian records claimed.

6. There are significant consequences for the author to have been lying, or making erroneous conclusions or assumptions. For example, a scientist would have their reputation tarnished if they did not follow proper scientific conduct.

7. The evidence is corroborated by not just different sources, but different fields. For example, confirming historical records with archaeological finds. Confirming genetic hierarchies with the fossil record.

Now when you look at scientific papers, all of the above are usually true. Historical records are likely to have most of them true, but not always.

Make no mistake, historical records are not always reliable. There is huge debate over even fairly recent events. For example, we have historical records that Napoleon died of stomach cancer. But, there is also evidence to suggest that he could have been poisoned. There is further discrepancy as to whether the poisoning was deliberate, or just accidental exposure. As it stands, the only real consensus on the matter is ""we don't know"". That's why I say scientists are generally more reliable than historical records.

Likewise, there are a number of things that would make an account less trustworthy:

1. Extraordinary claims without matching evidence. Eg. Claims of supernatural events.

2. Claims that the author would have no way of knowing or verifying themselves. It's unlikely that anyone from two millennia ago would have had any knowledge about the creation of the universe.

3. The author has motivation to lie. They make a living, or reputation in particular circles, from telling people these lies.

4. The evidence is not available to examine.

5. Multiple sources are likely to have colluded or influenced each other. Eg. writers of different installments of religious texts were biased to confirm the previous installments.

Now when you look at how religious scriptures compare, they are obviously the least trustworthy. They make extraordinary claims. They do not have reasoning for their conclusions, you're just meant to have faith that they're right. Their target audience is unwilling or unable to verify or investigate their claims. There's no process of ensuring accuracy, and indeed most of its believers don't care about accuracy.

That is why verbal testimony alone is not proof, and trusting a scientific paper or historical document is nothing like trusting a scripture.",26,230,1525409409,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8gwpix/scientists_historians_scriptures/

DebateEvolution,8f5u8o,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,Observation,Quote from creationism no. 3,"It's time for my next quotes by creationists.

This time I visited the website of creation.com.

So let's have [the mission statement of creation.com](https://creation.com/what-we-believe) by translating it to plain English:

&gt; The final guide to the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself.

Translation: the bible is true because the bible says so and any critics from outside of the bible can be dismissed without further ado.

&gt; The account of origins presented in Genesis is a simple but factual presentation of actual events and therefore provides a reliable framework for scientific research into the question of the origin and history of life, mankind, the Earth and the universe.

and:

&gt; The various original life forms (kinds), including mankind, were made by direct creative acts of God.

and:

&gt; The great Flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and effect.

and to be sure:

&gt; Scripture teaches a recent origin for man and the whole creation.

&gt; The days in Genesis do not correspond to geologic ages, but are six [6] consecutive twenty-four [24] hour days of Creation.

&gt; The Noachian Flood was a significant geological event and much (but not all) fossiliferous sediment originated at that time.

But what happens when you make observations that contradict these *dogmas*? Well:

&gt; Facts are always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information. By definition, therefore, no interpretation of facts in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record.

In plain English: how much observations you have contradicting Genesis, it does not matter.

This is anti-science *at its finest*. It diametrically opposes the scientific attitude and methodology.

Remember there is no link between man and ancient apes it’s a complete fairytale and lie! We have apes then we have homo erectus which is man! Longer version &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Debate continues over the australopithecines, but close examination of the dentition and jaws, the position of the foramen magnum, the upper body bones, the rib-cage and waist, the arm, hand and phalanges, the pelvis, hip and thigh, the legs, knees and feet, and the ankle joint not only shows that they were not bipedal, but that they were ancestors of today’s great apes, the chimpanzees and gorillas. The habilines likewise have been difficult for the palaeoanthropologists to classify as a uniform group, because the evidence clearly shows that they were variants of the australopithecines and not a separate taxon within the genus Homo. Only evolutionary bias has hindered them from concluding that apes and humans are unrelated and were created separately. Homo erectus is the species name assigned to human fossils that evolutionists claim are transitional forms between australopithecines (apes) and modern humans. To date, more than 280 fossil individuals have been found that are identified with this group. The species name means “erect or upright man” and was the name first put forth by Ernst Mayr to unify the classification of Asian fossils.
&gt; Creationists generally agree that all supposed ape-men fossils are, in fact, either ape or fully human. Species names within the taxonomic genus homo are viewed as fabricated classes invented to support evolutionary theory, and should be regarded as mere instruments of propaganda.

Yeast are unicellular. 

So each individual cell has to do *everything*. Any gene that isn't involved in something important wouldn't be preserved.

1) that the ancestral system had *only* those parts

2) that the ancestral system had the same function

3) that the ancestral system worked the same way

4) that the pathway to the present system *must have* involved selection at each step. 

All of the above conditions are required for an irreducible complexity argument to work, and none are supported.

DebateEvolution,8eojmj,TheBlackCat13,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The naturally-occurring Oklo nuclear reactors -- Implications for radioactive decay rates,"Although not strictly about evolution, this is relevant to radiometric dating, so I would like to see creationists rebuttal to the phenomena.

The [Oklo nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor) were a group of naturally-occurring light water fission reactors that formed in what is now Gabon, Africa about 1.7 billion years ago.  The reactors were able to form because back then the proportion of the less stable uranium 235 was higher in the past, meaning that there was enough U 235 in the natural uranium to support a self-sustaining chain reaction, which is not the case today.  That is why we need to “enrich” uranium today, we need to increase the proportion of U235.  Combine that with groundwater that slowed down the neutrons enough and a lack of neutron-absorbing materials, and self-sustaining chain reactions resulted.

Light water fission reactors are the most common type of fission reactor used by people, so they have been studied in excruciating detail.  We know enough minute details about how these reactors work that from the remains of the reactor we can tell how long they operated at a time, how long between each time, and how long they ran total.  

The key issue is that these reactions are extremely sensitive to small changes in the rate and energy of radioactive decay.  Even a small change to either would cause the reactor to behave differently than modern reactors in ways that would be immediately obvious.  Further, an increase in the rate of decay at any point since the reactor stopped running would have caused it to start up again.  

So from this, we can tell that the rate of decay of uranium at least has not changed significantly in the last 1.7 billion years.  This is important because Uranium decay is one of the most important dating techniques for dating very old samples.

Further, it has implications for radioactive decay rates of other elements.  The rate of radioactive decay is related to the rate of neutron capture by various elements, with this rate having different implications for different elements.  By looking at the isotope signature in the reactors, we can tell that none of these other types of decay have changed since the reactor operated, either.",22,11,1524608735,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8eojmj/the_naturallyoccurring_oklo_nuclear_reactors/

The comment above was about the only thing he had to say about this stupefying list of falsifications of a 6000 years old earth. YET he managed to state that:

&gt; Sir, you have already been debunked. Sit down and learn how to rhetoric. 

More of his:

&gt; First, we do not know if the rates of decay were the same. We don't know anything about the past beyond the last verified human observation.

The usual distortion of the scientific method and why we must keep creationists out of the classrooms (*and* /u/evolution). 

I can't replay all of his weird statements but this one I cannot let slip through:

&gt; Coal was instantaneously created when the universe came into being. There was also a certain amount of radioactive decay already present at the creation of the universe. The Grand Canyon was created by the Great Flood. The fossils were deposited by the Global Flood. 

So I challenged him:

1. your evidence that coal was formed during the onset of the universe.

2. your evidence please that the universe was created.

3. your evidence that radioactivity was present at the onset of the universe.

4. your evidence that the GC was created by the flood.

5. especially your evidence how a flood can produce the particular geological stratification observed in the GC as I pointed you out to THREE times now.

6. also especially your evidence how a flood can produce the biostratification as observed world wide and evidently also in the GC. 

7. your explanation please how a flood could produce sandstone formations with remnants of dunes, cross beddings and no marine fossils.

8. your explanation how coal layers, when formed during the onset of the universe as you stated, end up *in the middle and sandwiched* between other layers?

9. your evidence of a world wide flood happening in the first place.

10. your evidence of a 6000 years old earth (or universe).

But don't expect him to answer these questions, because:

DebateEvolution,8dkg4u,chokfull,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Design does not imply a designer.,"Hey guys, I was told this would be an appropriate sub for this topic. It's something I've received a *lot* of controversy about, including people calling me stupid or dishonest for presenting my argument. This is probably my last attempt to validate this idea, but if the mods feel like this is inappropriate for this sub, let me know and I'll post it elsewhere. Some of the most common responses I have gotten tell me to post this argument in a more science-heavy subreddit like this one.

#Quick Summary

I apologize for the long post. This argument has become very in-depth. All of the smaller sections at the bottom are just responses to common arguments I've been presented with. For a quick summary: 

Design has many definitions, some of which imply intelligence, some of which do not. Our bodies clearly have function and structure. A reasonable person might describe this as ""design"". It fits well within the technical definitions, and this understanding is supported by some key biologists, although whether or not such language should be used, and when, remains controversial.


#Main Argument

It's a very common argument for theists to present that the universe shows elements of design, and design implies a designer, therefore creationism is a sensible belief. However, I posit that **design does not imply an intelligent designer**. This argument is entirely about semantics, of course, but it has many implications in our understanding of what evolution *is*, and it is a component of a separate argument that I made in an [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/8bn4lm/besides_the_standard_triomni_god_i_think_the/?st=jg1oyg0h&amp;sh=3295b362). This was a very controversial stance that I took, and so I felt that it deserved its own post. 

Now, in common usage, this is often the intent behind the word. This is why the watchmaker's analogy is so enticing. However, if we look at some of the definitions of the word and related words, we see:

**Design:** purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object; a pattern; an underlying scheme that governs functioning, developing, or unfolding; the arrangement of elements or details in a product or work of art

**Purpose:** the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists

**Function:** an activity or purpose natural to or intended for a person or thing

**Reason:** a cause for an action or event

**Scheme:** a systematic or organized configuration

None of these words *necessitate* intelligence. Particularly, ""purpose"" only requires a reason, and reason is a very general term that can be broken down to ""cause"". The human eye clearly has a function, and by extension it clearly has a purpose (purpose and function are synonyms), and therefore a design. Now, of course, for the human body as a whole, the only ""purpose"" for its design is to survive and reproduce. This purpose is not put in place by an intelligent form, but it clearly exists.

In fact, if you disagree with me about ""purpose"", there are further definitions of ""design"" that are even looser. A design can simply refer to a pattern (a synonym for design). An underlying scheme that governs functioning. The arrangement of elements in a product. None of these require intelligence, and can easily be produced by nature. *Design is a very general term that can apply to many concepts*.




Below is an excerpt from [Kenneth Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._Miller)'s *Deconstructing Design: A Strategy for Defending Science*, page 3. For a quick tl;dr, Professor Miller's main argument is that the term ""design"" has a very strong appeal, and the scientific community should embrace it rather than rejecting it. The concept of design has many advantages in helping us understand what evolution really is, and ""it does not require the scientific specialist to solve the evolutionary origins of every conceivable structure, pathway, or organ."" Miller's stance is more focused on the rhetoric behind the argument than mine is, but my main purpose here is to show that this concept has scientific backing. Miller is a prominent person in the creation vs evolution debate, and has acted as an expert witness in the [Dover Panda Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District).

&gt;*One of the keys to the public success of the ID movement
has been the tacit agreement the scientific community
has given to the creationist argument that “design
requires a designer.” Because, to most laypeople, the
form and function of everything from the human body to
a muscle cell amount to “design,” the scientist seems
forced to argue that there is no design in nature and that
the exquisite architecture of life is some sort of illusion.
This approach fails as common-sense argument, but more
importantly, it fails as science. There is indeed a “design”
to living systems—but it is not the top-down design that
would be produced by an architect or craftsman; it is a
bottom-up design that is the result of evolution.*

&gt;*We should begin our deconstruction of the design argument
by pointing out the obvious—that living systems do
show a correlation between structure and function that a
reasonable person might indeed call “design.” The structural
biologist David DeRosier (1998) acknowledged this
point exactly when he reviewed the organization of the
bacterial flagellar motor, stating that “… more so than
other motors, the flagellum resembles a machine de -
signed by a human.” The question, of course, is whether
this resemblance implies the sort of intelligent agent that
the advocates of ID would suggest. It does not, as Bruce
Alberts has pointed out (Alberts 1998). Among the questions
he would have scientists ask about “protein ma -
chines,” Alberts wrote, was “to what extent has the design
of present-day protein machines been constrained by the
long evolutionary pathway through which the function
evolved, rather than being optimally engineered for the
function at hand?” I believe that Alberts was on to something.
As his words suggest, biological complexity can
indeed show “design,” but a design revealed and constrained
by the process of evolution itself.*

&gt;*In his book, Your Inner Fish, paleontologist Neil
Shubin addressed the issue of biological design at the
physiological level by bringing evidence together from
fossils, developmental biology, and molecular genetics
(Shubin 2008). There is indeed a design to the body, as
Shubin demonstrated, a design reflecting the evolutionary
history of our species. Our skeletal structure results from
a modification of the fish body plan; our muscles are laid
out in segments that reflect the blocks of tissue associated
with each segment of the vertebrate body, and even the
complex and confusing pathways of cranial nerves can be
explained by comparison with our evolutionary relatives.*

&gt;*Even proteins can fairly be said to possess a design, yet
once again, that design makes sense only in evolutionary
terms. This fact was brilliantly exploited in a study that
used evolutionary relationships between present-day
organisms to reconstruct the actual gene for an ancestral
corticoid receptor existing some 450 million years ago
(Ortlund et al. 2007). Using the comparative structures of
two different receptor proteins, one that binds glucocorticoid
and another specific for mineralocorticoid, they
reconstructed the ancestral receptor from which both are
derived. The comparative study not only proved the value
of exploiting the evolutionary design of protein structures,
but also provided new insights into the mutational
pathways by which gene duplication generates new biochemical
systems with novel functions.*

&gt;*In short, the scientific community can make the case
for evolution by accepting the concept of design and then
demonstrating that the design of living things is an evolutionary
one. One element of the power of this approach is
that it clearly rises above the appeal to ignorance inherent
in ID. Another equally important aspect is that it does not
require the scientific specialist to solve the evolutionary
origins of every conceivable structure, pathway, or organ.
By demonstrating that well-understood cases display
clear evidence of their evolutionary ancestry, the point is
made and it is made convincingly.*






Design has many meanings. Design can be a verb or a noun, it can refer to a process or a result, it can be utilitarian or decorative, and it can refer to intelligent design and natural design. These definitions have distinct purposes, but it is important to recognize the similarities and differences among them. Design is a very broad and powerful term, and it goes against reason and against common language to combat it.


**Here are some responses to common counter-arguments I've gotten a number of times:**


#Use in common language

I've been told that this isn't the common meaning of design. However, this understanding has plenty of use in common language. A cursory reading of articles, papers, and such on this topic reveals a use of design in this manner. Many refer to the theory of evolution, when presented in opposition to creationism, as ""Design Without Designer"". One might also refer to the ""design"" in a peacocks' tail, or in a pattern of ice. 

As a matter of fact, when I present this idea to any of my friends or family members, they agree with me very readily. It seems to me that the stark opposition I face is only present in atheist-heavy communities where the idea of ""design"" has a strong negative connotation.

#Intelligence or planning

Do not be misled by the common use of the concept of design; I am not making a claim to any intelligence, consciousness, or planning behind evolution. The purpose behind my argument is to show that design does not necessarily equate to intelligence. Evolution acts randomly. Mutations happen by chance. Design *does* often imply a designer, but in this case the only ""designer"" is random natural selection (and other factors that drive evolution).

Some have argued that design and purpose imply motivation and intent. Intent more commonly implies intelligence, but it can be used as a synonym for purpose, and so can technically apply here, too. In fact, intent can be found in the very definition of ""function"", as mentioned earlier. Motivation, however, strictly refers to the reason behind someone's actions, and so *requires* intelligence.

There is no ""planning"" required for design. Normal intelligent design makes use of plans, and so is a ""top-down"" approach. However, the design I am speaking of here uses a ""bottom up"" approach.

Please also be aware that, if you intend to prove that design requires intelligence, you must prove that *all* definitions of design require intelligence. If one definition does not require intelligence, then it is perfectly valid to used design in a context that excludes intelligence. ""Design"" has many definitions, and I am aware that some of them specifically refer to intelligent design, since that is a common usage.

#Selection in evolution

Some comments have accused me of misunderstanding evolution, and attempting to attribute a sort of planning or purpose that does not really exist.

I very strongly believe I am not misunderstanding how evolution works. I know the order of operations. I do not believe that selection is the only factor that drives evolution. There is no end goal in place. There is no grand plan. I am simply attempting to apply this word to account for the complexity and clearly functional capabilities of species. Species do not simply fall together by chance - chance is involved, but there's a process to it.

I hope I can help resolve this issue by my references to Ken Miller. Mr. Miller is known for opposing creationism and intelligent design via evidence for evolution, and has published papers and given talks on this very subject. At the very least, this might help show that this isn't just some layman's misunderstanding of how evolution works, but rather the concept has legitimate scientific backing (although admittedly it remains somewhat controversial, as discussed below.)



#Devaluing purpose and design

Some have argued that if my argument is true, then water flowing downriver has purpose and design.

I do not think this is entirely untrue either. Water can carve a design into a landscape. Crystalline structures have design. There is a *reason* for both of these. However, they are less purposeful, and less designed. One thing can have more design than another. A computer has more design than a pen. Random rocks and water patterns have less purpose and design than a fully formed multicellular organism. 

#Teleology in biology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology_in_biology

Someone linked me this article as though it were proof that I was wrong. This was one of the best arguments I received, but this article only shows that the use of such language is controversial because it can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g. intelligent design). While this may be problematic if the usage is let out of hand, I do not believe this shows me to be technically incorrect.

From the article:

&gt;Firstly, the concept of adaptation is itself controversial, as it can be taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin argued, that biologists agree with Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss in his 1759 satire Candide that this is ""the best of all possible worlds"", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions.

This is a misconception that is not evidenced by the concept of design. Design can be flawed, and very often is. A watch can be made incorrectly. Evolution is design by trial and error, which is a very flawed and inefficient method (although the only one available thanks to the lack of intelligence). Design doesn't imply perfection or optimization.


&gt;Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of natural theology, that the natural world gives evidence of the conscious design and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray.

See my arguments about intelligence. While there is a link, my entire argument is that the concept of design can be separated from intelligence.


And the rest is similar. So, the language may present certain obstacles, and certain misunderstandings may arise when not properly explained. I might be in favor of avoiding teleological language in the classroom, perhaps. However, my main argument for atheism is a reversal of the [argument from design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy) for theism, and so I find the language both technically accurate and necessary. 

#What's the point?

Some people asked me what the purpose of this argument even is. Well, if it has no value, why bother refuting it? It *is* entirely about semantics. I admit that from the start. However, I have a separate argument that utilizes this concept, so it has value to me. When I posted the argument, I received a great number of rebuttals focused around this point exactly, so I felt it was worth defending.

It also affects how these ideas are communicated. Plenty of people take a look at the world around them, and see that it has design. If they believe that, and believe that design requires a designer, they're more likely to believe in God. Language affects our perception of the world. Rhetoric affects reality. 

#You're just wrong

If you think that my definition is incorrect, that's fine. However, please remember that *I, and many other people, including biologists with a great understanding of evolution, accept this definition of ""design"".* Therefore, it's important to remember that if I, or anyone else, uses this word, they might be using a looser version of it that does not imply intelligence. Since I now better understand that this definition is controversial, I will take care to specify this understanding if it becomes important to a philosophical debate in the future.

If anyone has some alternate terminology that they feel better suits this phenomenon, I would be very open to replacing ""design"" with a new term in my argument. For now, however, I will simply clarify my intent by saying ""Natural Design"".

Ray Comfort, a crackpot who thought he had proof for creation by showing how a banana perfectly fits our hands, ""see how god created the banana to fit our hands?"", once was asked ""if evolution isn't true, how do you explain things like the blind spot in the human eye?"". His response:

&gt; I don’t have a blind spot in my eye. Both of them see very well and I am thankful for the 137million light sensitive cells that make sight possible. Do you have a blind spot in your eye? If you do, I suggest that you see an optician and see if he can either fix it, or get you another eye.

Then of course we have Ken Ham. When asked ""If God created the world 6,000 years ago or so, why are stars millions of light years away?"" he answered:

&gt; What a question! Yes, we know from the dates God gives us in the Bible that He did create the whole universe about 6,000 years ago. When we hear the term light-year, we need to realize it is not a measure of time but a measure of distance, telling us how far away something is. Distant stars and galaxies might be millions of light-years away, but that doesn’t mean that it took millions of years for the light to get here, it just means it is really far away!

The problem is there was no-one among creationists who rectified this. Another problem is that when 99% of creationists hear this blatant nonsense, they start to wave hands and shout ""Hallelujah"".

DebateEvolution,8ax1w1,Metamorphone,YEC turned Agnostic Evolutionist ,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,21 Reasons Noah's Flood didn't happen,"A little while ago, Geologist Laurence Collins posted an article titled [""Twenty-one Reasons Noah’s Worldwide Flood Never Happened.""](http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/Nr38Reasons.pdf) Great read.

On [AiGNews,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=l9fqMAFABD8) YEC Andrew Snelling tried to tear these arguments down. His efforts were not great. That's what I'll show here. So let's dig in.

We start with reason 1, by Snelling saying rocks can harden in a day. He’s conflating cementation with lithification, which is dishonest from a geologic perspective. A chemical cement could harden the layer but that isn’t the same as lithifying it into rock…like, at all. Lithification takes time, much more than they have. 

Tim Helble, an Old Earth Creationist and hydrologist who works in studying YEC claims, told me this in an email a while ago on this very topic, which shows why *lithification* is not possible for the YEC timeframe. 

&gt; For Hoover Dam, if the concrete had been poured into a single huge dam-sized mold, it would have developed huge cracks and taken 125 years to cure - we still wouldn't be able to use it today and when it finally cured, the dam would be useless!  Now try to scale up to a formation that is hundreds of feet thick and covers tens of thousands of square miles like the Redwall Limestone -- it would still be a lime mush 4350 years later.  Also, the lithification process releases heat which could only be dissipated over an enormous length of time -- *If it were possible for the earth's sedimentary layers to harden in only a few thousand years, the heat released would be enough to melt the planet.*  Therefore, Roth's argument that the dissolution cavities in the Redwall were filled in with Watahomigi rock is implausible from the start.

Next for 2, Snelling says salt deposits can form from hydrothermal mechanisms underwater, not just by evaporation. True, but there are abundant deposits [showing no evidence of hydrothermal or volcanic activity.](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/hot-water) So hydrothermal activity can not be called upon for many evaporites and the problem still stands. 

Then for 3, Snelling claims the Zion Park dunes, aka Navajo Sandstone, have angles consistent with water deposition, not desert. This is incorrect. Water deposited sand wave cross-bedding rarely exceed 10 degrees, far from the 25 degrees claimed by the young earth theorists.  Eolian sand waves cross-bedding varies from 11 to 34 degrees, with an average of 25-28 degrees. The ICR [identifies](https://www.icr.org/article/marketing-navajo-sandstone) them as 20-30 degrees. Desert angles, not water angles. 

When it comes to 4, 5, 6. Snelling says the mudcracks, raindrop imprints, etc., do not resemble modern ones. This is [false.](https://imgur.com/gallery/AOkIP) 

 Fun fact, the YECs  he’s citing didn’t even analyze real raindrops. I have a WIP slideshow from Helble, refuting Whitmore’s claims about the Coconino Sandstone. I won’t share it without his OK since it isn’t done, but the uh, “raindrop imprints?” *Scorpion tracks.* You can see the tail drag marks. Really, really embarrassing. He also shows real raindrop imprints compared to modern ones, and yeah, they’re identical. 
Snelling also throws out Michael Oard’s BEDS hypothesis. [It doesn’t work,](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/oard-2011) so that’s in the garbage. 

Also lol at the healthy dose of “Were you there?™” 

On to 7 and 8. More “They’re assuming present is key to the past.” No, and if you follow the references, Collins lays out very well why so many coccoliths would not be able to survive. Instead of addressing this, or the radiolarians, he just throws out a story of a fossilized fish with another fish in it’s gut. Until he gives us the geologic context of the specific subformation it was found, this is useless. Snelling also conflates separate formations as if they’re the same. 

Also, dinosaurs and birds together with marine creatures? Yeah, no. These are [rare](https://ageofrocks.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/oceans-of-kansas-unexpected-fossils-and-young-earth-creationism/) when compared to the marine fossils and are more consistent with dead creatures being out washed than a global flood. No issue there. But boy oh boy does Snelling get mad over this. Cute. 

Next, 9. Apparently the countless coring tests done year after year don’t count, because until every rock is checked, we can’t say no pollen exists in the Grand Canyon rock layers. That’s just not true. Also, Snelling conflates rough layering a flood might produce with the ability to sort pollen by very tiny differences in shape and protrusions. That isn’t realistic, and it’s dishonest as hell. 

His final excuse, Ecological Zonation, doesn’t work. Pollen gets spread by wind, it would cover the pre-flood world, mix into the oceans, etc. It should be found in these layers, buried with the ecological zones they landed in. This isn’t hard. 

Then we have 10. He claims the jumbled crinoids being broken up supports a flood. No, it supports them dying and breaking apart before burial. He doesn’t address the problem of numbers. 

Onto 11. Snelling doesn’t address this at all, just mixes it with 10 as if it were the same problem. 

My favorite, 12. Snelling claims Volcanoes at the start of the flood could trigger wildfires, and this is what formed charcoal. They then laugh as if this is an easy solution. A no-brainer. 

It isn’t. Unfortunately for Snelling, [most fusain deposits show no evidence of volcanic activity.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929) There are exceptions, sure, but most lack nearby magmas or volcanic ash mixed within, which is least we should expect to find. It in fact seems like lighting was the cause of most wildfires, which makes sense, as it is today. So, until Snelling has evidence that there was widespread vulcanism, [which somehow left no trace of itself, even in fires bigger than all of Ireland,](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1992.tb02129.x) the objection is baseless. Huge wildfire deposits are still a falsification of a worldwide flood. And lets not forget that even if some mechanism for ignition was evident, it would not be able to cover such a wide area without being squelched by rain, sea mist, tsunamis, etc. Wildfires today can be stopped by large thunderstorms? Biblical rains? Not a chance one would survive to that size.

Then we have 13. All he does is say ""The methods are flawed™""

Lol, citation needed. I’m not taking the word of someone who doesn’t care how the methods even work, [just wants pretty numbers.](http://questioninganswersingenesis.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-does-andrew-snelling-use-rate-team.html)

For 14, 15, 16, they claim these are based on assuming the erosion rates were constant. This is disingenuous. 14 is based on evidence in the rocks, not from the modern river. 15 is about magma cooling, in a Precambrian formation. Magical flood doesn’t help here. To cool this magma they have to postulate god sucked the heat out miraculously. That’s an unscientific assertion, made last ditch, with no evidence. Nice. 16 is based on evidence from observing what rapid flash flooding does to the granite yearly. It still, with rough flash floods so full of sand they work like sandpaper, takes too long. This isn’t a naturally slow process, its that *rapid processes are still too slow for YECism* 

But nah, ramble about Uniformitarianism and don’t address the evidence. And unlike Snellings rambling defenses, Snelling is the one who didn’t do the homework. Collins did. 

Number 17 was not addressed. 

For 18, they claim they can’t see the evidence for themselves. Maybe they should read further down where pictorial evidence is given. Of course they don’t tell their listeners, who won’t bother to read the paper. 

With 19, they say Koreans showed a model of the ark could survive. 

From what I can gather, assuming I have the right study, this just isn’t the case. [The actual modeled flood conditions would be harmful.](http://www.oldearth.org/argument/N221_creation_science.htm) [More info on the study here](https://discourse.biologos.org/t/the-ark-was-a-simple-box-shape/36173/10). It just doesn’t work. 

Onto 20. ""The fountains of the deep would cause the earthquakes."" This is the one argument I’ll grant, fountains of such sort would cause some earthquakes I would think. But I don’t think Collins is entirely wrong; the claim that a tsunami formed the Great Unconformity is still without scientific support. For instance, YECs mark layers with fossil stromatolites as “preflood”, formed before the flood but after creation week. How come, then, these rocks which do showcase fossilization, have no advanced life? After all, complex life existed around then in the YEC model. Death existed, fossils were clearly being made. To claim that not one shark tooth, whale bone, clam shell, etc. managed to get fossilized, or that we’ve missed it despite countless digging efforts and how long YECs have for shells to die and be buried, is ludicrous. Other excellent details are in the book “Grand Canyon: Monument to an Ancient Earth.” 

And finally, the final reason. They just go on ranting about point 20, and don’t address things like the Surprise Canyon Formation. Go figure. That's a nail in the coffin for [Flood Geology](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7i8j1j/the_surprise_canyon_formation_a_notsolittle/)


So…this is their top mind at work. I’m not impressed. As Snelling so accurately put, “People see what they want to see.” There is no clearer example of bias blinding someone to the evidence than in Snelling’s own defenses here. He is a perfect example of [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XHGAB)

&gt; Creation isn't a theory. The fact that God created the universe is not a theory, it's true. However, some of the details are not specifically nailed down in Scripture. Some issues such as creation, a global flood, and a young age for the earth are determined by Scripture, so they are not theories. My understanding from Scripture is that the universe is in the order of 6,000 years old. Once that has been determined by Scripture, it is a starting point that we build theories upon. It is within those boundaries that we can construct new theories.

Evolutionists went on to develop the theory of evolution simply for the sake of explaining earths life forms in a way that does not involve God.

The claim that there are ""mountains of evidence"" in support of evolution is patently false. They are in reality mountains of convoluted material produced in favor of evolution. Much of it is based on misinterpreted fossil and DNA evidence and attempts to retrofit evolution into things. The so called ""proofs"" for evolution are just conjecture (""how it have happened"" scenarios) and speculation. 

Its no coincidence that evolution is embraced by virtually all atheists, and that many prominent atheists are passionate about *evangelising* evolution. If atheism is merely a lack of belief in God, then its strange that atheists defend/promote evolution with the same zeal as a religious apologist.

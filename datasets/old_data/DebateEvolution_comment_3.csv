t1_ffiumeb,GaryGaulin,"&gt;All your experiments showed was that it may be possible to form RNA. It didn’t show how information in RNA and DNA could form.

Self-replicating molecules that evolved over time [Gerald Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Joyce) is famous for having been the first to develop do not have a random distribution of nucleotides in their sequences. Over time it's what you are calling nonrandom ""information"" that fills a tiny test environment. 

The links led to thousands more containing repeatable chemistry experiments to generate recognizable ""information"" patterns found in modern cells where there has since been billions of years worth of refinement of the most useful sequences to through replication amplify until it fills an entire planet, including living things that live deep in the warm mantle. 

Molecular structure of active sites of cell enzymes have rock/mineral equivalents with the same catalytic action. It's nice to have cell sized portable versions of rocks many times their size, but there is nothing wrong with staying close to home where useful active sites are well provided by the surface of the minerals they grow into.

The real problem I see is from not wanting to think about things that became known by the year 2020. Conspiracy theories and misinformation made it easy for some to completely ignore what is happening in reality, where there is now a lot of studying and molecular pathway based explaining to do before being able to responsibly describe to the general public.

I bolded some of the important things that should have been flashing like a strobe light at you:

t3_etledc,ThurneysenHavets,"&gt;That would involve showing how, given a realistic (or even an unrealistic, like those above) set of assumptions, deleterious mutations actually do accumulate constantly in a genome.

I have a question. Something I've wondered about for some time:

You're making this argument in general theoretical terms, implying that it would apply regardless of the relevant biological parametres. As in, genetic entropy is inherently a contradiction in terms and therefore cannot ever happen.

Well, suppose you imagine a hypothetical human population, where we artificially raise the mutation rate by increments and observe the consequences. Such that it gradually increases from 100 per person per generation to 200, to 300, to 400 etc.

Are you arguing this population would, every time we ramped up the mutation rate, just settle on a new mutation-selection equilibrium? Ad infinitum? Or would the elevated mutation rate eventually cause a problem, and what would the nature of that problem be?",1579989862

t1_ff14hje,JohnBerea,"&gt; the empirical work doesn't seem to accord with it:  ""Of the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.""

At this time we don't know the exact function of &gt; 98% of nucleotides in the genome.  Even if we did, the function is [highly redundant](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6131.long), ""such that double or triple disruptions are required for a phenotypic consequence.""

My [Junk DNA article](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna) makes the case that enough of our DNA is functional that we likely receive dozens of deleterious mutations per generation, based on several overlapping evidences of function, even though we usually don't know what specific functions a nucleotide contributes to.

&gt; Do you think there's significant empirical evidence that genomes are generally deteriorating?

I think the process is so slow in large complex animals like us that it's hard to measure.  I have this blurb saved in my notes, but I haven't yet had time to dig through the research behind it:

1.  ""the results suggest that humans are carrying around larger numbers of deleterious mutations than they did a few thousand years ago. But this doesn’t mean that humans now are more susceptible to disease, says Akey.
Rather, it suggests that most diseases are caused by more than one variant, and that diseases could operate through different genetic pathways and mechanisms in different people.""

If we were to group HIV differently, we would have seen some go “extinct”. If the criteria which sorted various genomes  into a “strain” were narrow  enough, at some point due to mutations that met those criteria. I know that might not be self-evident, so I’ll make an absurdist example to demonstrate it. Imagine that a “strain” was defined having a singular and exact genome as the criteria for set inclusion. Only in the case that  mutation from that genome was deleterious would one anticipate that exact genome lasting more than few generations. Any possibility of positive or neutral mutations would mean that the original genome would very quickly becoming increasingly less represented among an ever-increasing number of other (presumably similarly defined) virus genomes. 

Now of course, HIV strains aren’t defined that way. There is considerable genetic variation within a strain. The particular boundaries of what genomes are included in a strain have been rationally developed, but are in some sense still arbitrary. They have been defined as having particular attributes in genotype or etiology, and are defined broadly enough to be useful (having a strain per genome is pointless) for categorization, but narrow enough to allow useful description.

t3_etledc,MRH2,"Thanks for defining your terms and for this post.

&gt; Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we also remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

&gt; So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.   
after 2: 12/2/16.   
after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)   
One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial.

I want to figure out what you're saying here. 
Let's assume that at that mutated site, A is the original base. With 1 beneficial and two deleterious, lets say that beneficial is A-&gt;T and deleterious is A--&gt;G and A-&gt;C. 

So with one deleterious mutation, A-&gt;C happens. We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (beneficial relative to C),     
C-&gt;T (very beneficial relative to C), and     
C-&gt;G (from one bad thing to a different bad thing)

&gt; So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. 

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 2/1/0

Initially we postulated 1 b and 2d at this site. Now we have 2b and one n. **BUT** the problem is how you are defining things. You're saying that it's beneficial relative to where it is now.  If we look at the original genome and see what it is, we get a different situation:

A bad mutation has happened (A-&gt;C).  We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (neutral relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;T (beneficial relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;G (deleterious relative to the original genome)

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 1/1/1

I have trouble with you defining C-&gt;A as beneficial and C-&gt;G as neutral.  I suspect that if you follow it through using this way of looking at it, you'll end up with quite different results (maybe you or someone could crank this out. I had to actually use 4 specific bases in order to follow what's going on). And these results should provide a better match to observations of harmful mutations building up in populations (assuming that this is what we see).",1579957232

This is a problem for two reasons: 

First, if, as they claim, the pre-'09 strains went extinct in '09, then it's completely inappropriate the just add all the mutations together - the '09 pandemic should represent a completely new lineage. 

Second, we know that the '09 pandemic was a reassorted (i.e. recombinant) strain, so most of those differences weren't due to single-base point mutations - they were due to recombination between different strains.

4. Not relevant. Because, mutations occur - good and bad. The bad ones that do lead to death don’t get passed on and the rest just keep on spreading those alleles.

There was no non-sequitur because when you start with one gene and a mutated form arises now you have two forms and if two new one arise from those now you have for such that a single population having a single version of a gene now has at least for so that diversity is the result. The alternative would be identical clones because of mutation so that every organism was identical so that no diversity existed. This variety is the necessary diversity for natural selection because without it a single environment would kill all of them at once or it wouldn’t have any purifying effect at all. To select you need variety to choose from. These work hand in hand.",1579952241

And going back to the paper myself, the answer is YES, that's exactly what they do. *That's* what figure 2 shows. They're counting cumulative mutations in H1N1 from 1917 *to 2012* across this supposed extinction.

There is no compelling evidence that even the adaptability of e.coli is from 'mutation'.  That is hypothesized. The more likely explanation is the INHERENT ability of bacteria to adapt, by the unique ability of making slight changes to it's enzyme secretion.  Mutations, as a force on EVERY organism,  are deleterious.  They do NOT increase complexity or add functions.  To ascribe to 'mutation!' this ability of ecoli is spurious, at best.  It is an interesting theory, but it is not clearly established that mutation was the mechanism for adaptation, in this specific case.  That is assumed.

Then, to seize upon this study as 'proof of common ancestry!', is a greater leap of faith (and logic).  There is no transitional form being 'created', even after 66,000 generations.  A fruit fly study went to millions of generations, with still no transitional forms being created, under forced laboratory conditions.

Varying enzyme secretion is an inherent trait..  it is not, scientifically,  an example of mutation.   That is a theory, and not a compelling one, imo.

But even if it could be shown that deleterious mutations of genes can occasionally 'help' a bacteria to adapt, which this study does not, it is a leap of faith to conclude 'common ancestry!', via mutation.

t1_ff85yt0,CHzilla117,"&gt;The thread title was about genetics as evidence for evolution so thats why your invoking fossils is out of order and you should be making your case on genetics anyways.

You said that the conclusion of Africa being the place of humanity's 
origin was ""wild"". While genetic evidence alone is more than sufficient, such accusations still warrant mentioning some of the evidence.

&gt;As i said variation is relative to need, at least as a option

That would first need to be demonstrated, and yet it never has. And the thing is, many populations of animals with low diversity would greatly benefit from such a mechanism if it existed, and yet they don't. Tests have shown again and again that diversity in a species do not happen you the way you wish it did.

And then fact that most of the diversity in question is non-coding parts and that, as repeatedly stated, the pattern is for what the original human population would look like is ridiculously specific and Africa fits it to a T.

&gt;its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive.

Take a small portion of a larger population of deer and put them in a new environment were they now have limited gene flow with the original population. These deer will only have a portion of the original population's diversity. Now, after the new population has grown did it again. This new population will have even less. Do it again and again and this is exactly what the pattern of human diversity is like. And seeing as how extensive study no other process does the same, calling it suggestive would be an understatement even ignoring the vast amount of fossil evidence..

&gt;Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity to others.

That was nothing to do with diversity. Traits like skin pigment are under selective pressure, and so are of little use Put fair skinned people under conditions and keep them isolated and slowly those with mutations for darker skin will become more common. And that is why such traits are not considered when who is descended from who. It is the parts of the genome that do not code for anything that are.

All you have shown is that you seem lack understanding of what genetic diversity, which is what is being debated about, even is in the first place.

&gt;Finally nothing has shown genetic change comes only, or at all, by mutations. they just presume that because they have no other idea of a mechanism to change dna.

Not ideas, observations. Seeing as how mutation is defined as ""the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, that is the definition. Mutations being a result of only random process or deliberate modification by humans using advanced technology has been repeatably tested, not just assumed and asserted as truth like you do.

&gt; peoples bodyplan differences since the flood is the great obvious evidence. its impossible where we needed some change that only a few offspring got it from mutations and only they created new populations. God would not allow that.

This is a good example of confusing the claim for evidence, which is ultimately all you have done here. You assume a YEC timeline because of what you perceive the Bible to say, and take that as evidence. But the Bible would only be a claim, not evidence. And all you have done is ignore all actual evidence and make things up and claim them as fact.

And Bible isn't even the claim, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, which you quiet tellingly have ignored, in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/emxcfo/whats_the_creationist_explanation_for_these_human/ff2cblf/).

Lol, your boi Sanford is actually looking at swine flu fam.   
Sanford uses A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) as one of two reference genomes for his paper. These sequences were taken from the Christman et al. 2011 paper (erroneously referred to as Kedwaii et al. in Sanford's paper).  H1N1pdm reference strain A/California/04/2009 was classified as genotype  \[C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A\], with a lineage assigned sequentially to each of the eight genomic segments. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus arose from a reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, namely, a North American H1N2 and a Eurasian H1N1, each of which themselves arose from reassortments (Fig. 2) ([Garten et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0100), [Gibbs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0110), [Smith et al., 2009a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0275), [Smith et al., 2009b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0280), [Trifonov et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0315)). The North American swine virus was itself formed by at least two  previous reassortments in swine, contributing six segments: PB2, PB1,  PA, HA, NP, and NS. 

  
The quote from Sanford:

"" We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1  outbreak of 2009–2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. ""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an a**pparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.**""  

""Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, **and then again apparently in 2009;** and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

I'll repost some of the information you find necessary to ignore:

------------------------------------------------------

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

True to the reduced capacity for honesty in creationist circles, /u/PaulDouglasPrice flagrantly disregards 30 instances of the word ""extinct"" in relationship to H1N1 and unabashedly lies about it:   


  

""We document multiple **extinction** events, including the previously known **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.""

""These **extinctions** appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations.""

""Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957, when the human strain went **extinct**.""

""Apart from the 1917 pandemic, H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic, and human H1N1 essentially went **extinct** from 1957–1977.""

""Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual **extinction** of the viral strain.""

""Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (“lethal mutagenesis”) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain **extinction** \[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B25)\-[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B30)\].""

""Others have noted the temporal **extinction** of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""This discontinuity reflects the **extinction** of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s, followed by the re-introduction of the strain in 1976, presumably from a researcher’s freezer.""

""Notice that after re-introduction in 1976, the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the **extinction** occurred in the 1950s.""

""These fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 **extinction**.""

""However, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic (the porcine lineage had no **extinction** event, and hence no pause in mutation accumulation).""

""Human H1N1, the remnant of the 1918 lineage, appears to have gone **extinct** a second time.""

""Before its apparent **extinction** in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations (mostly point mutations), including 320 non-synonymous mutations, compared to the 1918 genotype.""

""This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time, perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as **extinction** approaches.""

""This is only possible if almost **all human influenza** lineages rapidly go **extinct**.""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the **extinction** of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second **extinction** event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. Strain **extinction** has often occurred when new strains appeared, including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3-like strains in 1917, H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957, and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""Our other evidences include: a) the **extinction** of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent **extinction** of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

""Finally, the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline, attenuation, **extinction** of most circulating strains, and even more frequent sub-lineage **extinction** events.""

""These facts, combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain **extinction**, all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.""

""Thus, the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual **extinction**.""

""Based on our mutation count analysis, there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone **extinct**, apparently twice.""

""The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago, and there has been universal **extinction** of all earlier human influenza strains.""

""Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went **extinct** in 1957, but was reintroduced in 1976, apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s.""

t1_ffgw1do,PaulDouglasPrice,"I'll explain this to you very clearly. They are referring to the specific strain they call the ""human version"" of H1N1, which is frequently called Spanish Flu. It came about in 1917 and went extinct first in the 1950s. It was re-released from containment in the 1970s and then went extinct a second time in 2009. However, in the 1950s the human strain jumped into swine before it went extinct. That swine version made a jump back to humans in 2009, and the mutational load shows a linear progression going all the way back to 1917. So even though the Spanish Flu jumped to pigs and reassorted, it kept accumulating mutations nonetheless. And this is why the 2009 swine flu was very weak compared to many fears. It was already highly attenuated when it jumped back to humans.

t1_ffgtyi8,arcturisvenn,"The word ""information"" is difficult to define without context, and you're playing with that ambiguity to try to make this argument.

In the general sense, information is just what we call it when a something could conceivably exist in multiple states, but that uncertainty has been resolved and it exists in only one of those states. Imagine three rocks in a line on the beach (A, B, and C). Picking a starting point and moving down the line, the order could be any of six sequences: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, or CBA. But even though there are six possible arrangements, the rocks exist in only one of the six. Let's say its BCA. That is information. The existence of information is in no way contingent on an intelligent agent.

You're blurring that with the idea of idea of encoding and decoding information. Systems can take information and encode it into a storage medium. You have already provided two examples: synaptic connections in the brain and cave paintings. Another obvious example is written language. Later on we decode that storage medium to get the information back. You see a tiger, you write ""I saw a tiger"" in a letter and mail it to  me, I read the letter and I know that you saw a tiger. We encoded and decoded information. Even here, there is no basis to assert that says a system needs to be intelligent to encode or decode information. Most life lacks any cognitive ability whatsoever, and they still manage to receive, store, transmit, and respond to information.

You're giving examples of ""encoding information"" but passing them off as if they were ""producing information"". It really doesn't matter which one we look at, except for clarity sake.

Indeed very small *individual* mutations may escape selective pressure. But sooner or later, *many* of them will inevitably surpass the threshold of selective pressure. And then they will be weeded out by selection.

And the funny thing here is that creationists, unknowingly and naively, actually bring in arguments that endorse this: they say that genetic entropy will occur, degrading the genome. But degrading the genome implies that fitness will inevitably decrease. So, to bolster that, Price came up a week ago with many examples of what he thinks happens in humans (all kinds of genetic conditions and the like). But as soon these happen and while such conditions ARE affecting fitness, as extensively explaned by Price himself, selection WILL kick in. *Unless* we prevent natural selection to act by medical intervention. IF deteriration of the human genome happens it's most likely due to unabling natural selection by humans themselves.

t1_ffbcxuo,Denisova,"&gt; There is no evidence humans ever had tails. its all a error probility curves.

Of course there is no evidence for that because humans do not have tails. and it's not about error probability curves or whatever fancy words you invoke to look like savvy, it's just because humans do not have tails.

Also the great apes do not have tails. Losing the tail happened in the common ancestor of the hominids. And we do have evidence of that, in embryonic gestation and in our genes.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF). The embryonic tail is composed of several complex tissues besides the developing vertebrae, including a secondary neural tube (spinal cord), a notochord, mesenchyme, and tail gut. These anatomic feats are typical and defining of the vertebrate tail. By the eighth week of gestation, the sixth to twelfth vertebrae have disappeared via cell death, and the fifth and fourth tail vertebrae are still being reduced. Likewise, the associated tail tissues also undergo cell death and regress. The remnant of vertebrae that remain shrink and fuse and eventually form the coccyx.

Moreover, we still have all the tail genes also found in animals that still wag a tail. In fact, the genes that control the development of tails in mice and other vertebrates have been identified (the Wnt-3a and Cdx1 genes). These tail genes have also been found in the human genome. As discussed below in detail, the development of the normal human tail in the early embryo has been investigated extensively, and apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a significant role in removing the tail of a human embryo after it has formed. It is now known that down-regulation of the Wnt-3a gene induces apoptosis of tail cells during mouse development, and similar effects are observed in humans. Additionally, researchers have identified a mutant mouse that does not develop a tail, and this phenotype is due to a regulatory mutation that decreases the Wnt-3a gene dosage. 

We do not even need to know about the fossil evidence of the loss of the tail in hominid ancestors. The embryoonic and genetic evidence says it all.",1579912993
t3_eti3z7,DefenestrateFriends,"What do you want to know/understand about it? Here's a breakdown of what they did, but it in no way supports GE, the extinction of H1N1, or that most mutations are bad.   


  

The authors took all available accession numbers \[numbers used to identify data in GeneBank\] for flu genomes from the Influenza Research Database(Zhang et al., 2017), Fluegenome.org (which looks is no longer available as of 1/24/2020)(Lu et al., 2007), and 2009-2010 H1N1 versions from a paper (Christman et al., 2011). They took the accession numbers and grabbed the genomic data from GenBank resulting in 3,755 human and 351 swine genomes. Then, they performed a multiple sequence alignment (which they said was quite easy because of how few indels there were #irony). Taking those alignments, they then compared the sequences to a reference H1N1 genome (which one they used isn’t clear in the methods, presumably it was California/04/2009 from the (Christman et al., 2011) study which they keep referencing by the second author, Kedwaii).   
 

From here, they present two lines of analysis: 1) they calculate mutation differences from this holotype genome through 2010 and 2) they calculate the mutations from H1N1 strains from 1918 to 2012 using a slightly modified A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 genome as the reference. 

The mutation differences are calculated as SNPs, indels, transitions, transversions, non-synonymous amino acid changes, dN/dS ratio (non-syn to synonymous changes), protein length, normalized codon scores (NSC), and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).

Figure 1 shows the mutations from the California/04/2009 up through the last H1N1 genome sequenced/collected in 2010. The last sequence has 80 mutations compared to the first sequence. They fit a regression line and found a slope of 41.959 although they report it as 42.1. This means, on average, we expect H1N1 virus to mutate 42 alleles per year (Carter and Sanford, 2012).   
 

Figure 2 is essentially the same analysis but begins with the amended A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 reference and catalogues mutations until 2012 using available sequences. The authors comment on a 1950’s extinction followed by a 1976 reintroduction of the virus. It’s unclear that these viruses are actually that well-related on the basis of this graph which seems to suggest distinct lineages merging around this time (notice the jump around 1980 from 1000 mutations to 1500 which linearly correlates with the 2009 outbreak strain). The authors do comment on the two distinct lineages of frozen versus non-frozen H1N1 strains i.e.—zoonosis causing antigenic shift. 

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing that there two distinct lineages of H1N1 being shown, they readjusted the timeframes and were able to re-calculate mutation rates per year which are shown in Figure 3. The top lines shows the corrected mutation rate of 14.4 per year and the bottom line shows the number of non-synonymous mutations per year (2.4). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the paper starts to break down:

Using these data, they estimate that the first arrival of H1N1 to be around 1893 and suggest that since it’s arrive until 1918, 325 new mutations were acquired (25 years x 15 mutations per year, even though the number is actually 14.4 according to their data). 

Now, the authors essentially assert and use language which insinuates “deleterious effects” from those mutations in the organism. For example, they say “nucleotide degeneracy” to mean “the nucleotide changed.” It doesn’t actually mean the mutation was bad. They also say, “further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non-adaptive.” That doesn’t mean deleterious, that literally means “the majority of mutations don’t increase fitness” i.e.—they can be deleterious *or neutral*.  

Figure 4 is the same analysis as before, but now shows the samples derived from porcine versus those derived from humans. Nothing terribly interesting here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The remaining figures graphically represent the type of mutation occurring between the lineages over time.   


Many of the conclusions they draw aren't supported by what they actually showed. For example, nothing in this paper evaluates fitness of the mutations they characterized.

t3_eseb2k,Denisova,"&gt; Humans had a tailbone right?

We still do have one, the coccyx.

Probably you meant ""humans once had tails"" but this is also wrong because not humans once had tails but one of their evolutionary ancestors. That would even be one of the ancestors of the Hominidae (=all great apes and humans and extinct species of hominids) because chimps, bonobos, gorillas and orang utans do not have tails either.

So you want to see fossils. Indeed we have many many fossils of hominids, more than 6000 altogether but all these are of hominids, not their common ancestor. That's mostly because that common ancestor was a forest dweller and tropical forests don't preserve fossils quite well, that's why we have rather abundant fossils of hominids in the human lineage because those left the forests and also why we don't have much fossils of chimpanzee evolution.

The hominid fossils indeed show a neat and chronological transition in traits from ape-like to human forms, like a gradual increase in skull volume, getting shorter arms but londer and stronger legs and gradual improvement in upright gait.

Now what about the tail. We have morphological and genetic evidence of tail vestiges.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF).

t1_fffz6je,ursisterstoy,"Now that I’ve explained how evolution actually works a couple times and it was already explained how organisms diversify to exploit available niches following an extinction event could you please be a bit more clear about what you are talking about here?

So are you suggesting that cockroaches and stag beetles are practically the same thing? 

These are the types of differences we already see among beetles. They’re still beetles because they have to be. Their ancestors were beetles. The same species of beetle if you go back far enough but they’ve obviously each acquired traits that the other lacks even though all cockroaches look like cockroaches and all stag beetles look like stage beetles because of how heredity spreads genes about a breeding population but not with groups that they can no longer produce fertile offspring by trying to breed with. They may even be said to have profound differences. They didn’t occur all at once, but they did occur.

What about domesticated dogs? They’re not all just the same size and shape animal with a different color fur are they? Some have short noses, some have long ones. Some are long and slender, some are wide and stalky. These types of changes separate us from Homo neanderthalensis as both lineages likely diverged from something like Homo heidelbergensis. These are all humans but not all the same group you see all around you. Even more profound changes if you compare us to robust Paranthropus species or Chimpanzees but as these lineages diverged from our before all of us independently acquired our unique traits the ancestor of all of us may be something more like Graecopithecus or Sahelanthropus and not exactly like any of the resulting groups. This is hominini but you need to compare those animals, and not modern forms to the ancestor of gorillas and Nikalipithecus would be more like the common ancestor of humans and gorillas  which can be traced even further back to animals like Proconsul and Aegyptopithecus but always a minor change in each case and not like comparing us directly to living gibbons or colobus monkeys. We share a common ancestor with tarsiers before the emergence of monkeys with organisms like Eosimius and Darwinius  being close to the time of this split. Including more groups and the common ancestor of these already small primates is starting to look a lot more like the ancestor of tree shrews until we back far enough and the ancestor of both groups is the same animal with glires (rabbits and rodents) also starting out looking a bit like a shrew as well. This isn’t as hard to grasp when we consider that tree shrews, shrews, and elephant shrews are found within three of the four divergent groups of living placental mammals. Juramaia likely represents our split from the marsupials but it may have given birth to helpless young just like marsupials still do, just like monotremes do if it wasn’t for the eggs they lay immediately before their babies emerge out of them. If you keep going back, though, the fossil record has several gaps explained by genetics. It doesn’t mean that we don’t have fossils, but most of what we do have consists of teeth and bits of jaw once our direct ancestors became small, small enough to survive the event that killed the dinosaurs. They had already been growing small before that because they couldn’t compete with them. It was their small size that ultimately led to us but before dinosaurs were dominating our planet, it was our own lineage, the synapids that outcompeted the sauropsids (or everything more closely related to reptiles and birds than to mammals). Dimetrodon is one of such synapsids, even though it may not be directly ancestral. And what about the ancestor of something like that. They were much smaller and probably cold blooded like lizards and they looked a lot like lizards, at least superficially, which isn’t much of a jump when considering salamanders are a lot like amphibious lizards and the ancestor of reptiliamorphs was also amphibious like a salamander but it wasn’t a salamander or an amphibian. That’s where our lineage diverges from the lineage leading to amphibians and is approaching the move to land from a fish ancestor for which many examples exist - and a side branch, the lung fish, still lives to this day. If we were to keep going all the way back the earliest fish were more like swimming worms with several important changes between that and bony fish. 

So despite, nothing being all at once, or a leap from one fundamentally different kind of life to the next but successive tiers of superficial changes compiled upon fundamental similarities there’s nothing left to consider but how dog breeds and subspecies are a similar result from the same process but with humans being the selective pressure in one case and natural selection in the other we still have genetic drift, heredity, genetic isolation, and so on but all you need to add is time. The time necessary to lead to a greater amount of divergence so that isolated groups can no longer produce fertile offspring but instead infertile hybrids like the result of breeding a horse and donkey being a mule that itself is sterile. This is about the point where these isolated groups start to compile on the successive changes that don’t cross over into the other group and that’s when the profound differences between the groups become apparent. It isn’t between parents and children but between distant cousins that we find dramatic differences or if we happen to skip over several hundreds or thousands of generations like in the case of the the human-chimp common ancestor and how chimpanzees and humans both eventually wound up strikingly different from how they started and each other despite the persistent similarities (including having the same broken genes and retroviruses) that we use to help us work out how everything is related.",1579912530
t1_fffs9ld,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt;But viruses are nothing more than replication machines

Paul, if you like things that are 'nothing more than replication machines', the rest of the biosphere is going to *blow your mind*. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They just replicate. That is their only function, and the faster they replicate the more efficiently that replication machinery is working. 

For someone claiming *I* have it backwards, this is all kinds of wrong. First, you're deciding that replication is their only function, which implies, given your position regarding creation, that your specific god CREATES DEADLY REPLICATION ENGINES DELIBERATELY. And since you seem to be convinced that said deadly replication engines subsequently die out due to 'genetic entropy', this also directly suggests you think your specific god does this repeatedly, in real time, even today. Because...the lulz?

Secondly, you can't even get your efficiencies right. Faster != more efficient, especially since your entire argument *relies on the fact that viral replication is error prone*. Fast replication is sloppy replication, and fast replication that also kills the host is sloppy *and* counterproductive. Biology doesn't select for speed unless speed is useful, and here it is not. The 'wrench' as you describe it is absolutely beneficial (if it wasn't, it would be lost quickly), and yet you are STILL trying to argue that this is somehow detrimental, just so you can cleave to this clearly incorrect notion that viral mortality equates to viral fitness.",1579912091
t1_ffg813q,ursisterstoy,"Well there were extinctions that occurred before the Cambrian period ever started but otherwise that’s basically it. Whatever organisms exist in any given environment will exploit any available niche until some are better at it than others and that’s where natural selection plays a vital role. Then when most of them do eventually die off, whatever is left exploits those available niches that arise. One main reason for having more fossils starting around the Cambrian period is probably likely due to several extinctions as there was an evolutionary arms race geared towards survival. There may have been organisms filling similar niches before that but we just can’t find all of them because they aren’t well preserved. It may have even been a mass extinction event that we can’t find any fossil evidence for, but nothing like the great dying or the KT extinction events that are better known for such events.",1579908999
t1_fffsson,ursisterstoy,"I think I explained this a bit in my main response to the original post but now that I know what you’re actually talking about perhaps I can add a bit more. 

Consider the types of variation that don’t get acted on by natural selection but disperse throughout a population anyway like eye color. Consider those that are detrimental but get passed on anyway like diabetes. Alongside beneficial mutations others spread and it isn’t only natural selection that controls the variety of traits that eventually spread throughout a population. There is genetic isolation such that some trait in one isolated population doesn’t spread to the main population. This is how we tell sister groups apart like the various dog breeds. They exist simultaneously in the same environment for what natural selection would produce in different environments or among populations filling a different role within the environment. There’s heredity, which unlike genetic isolation, spreads these traits (good, bad, or otherwise) throughout the breeding population such that once enough time passes there will be a spreading about of traits that aren’t lethal or reproduction inhibitors. That’s how multiple people have green eyes and how others have blue or brown. They didn’t emerge from a six eyed predecessor but from a brown eyed ancestor and the descendants acquired mutations that provide the phenotypical trait of having a different colored eye. There’s more variation with eyes than just this, but this is a good example for this example. 

Genetic drift is when a specific gene type (allele) is eventually weeded our of the population. For whatever reason, call it chance, one trait becomes common down the road that doesn’t provide any known beneficial or detrimental side effects. And then on whatever is left after all of this is accounted for and as multiple mutations pile on top of those that don’t provide any known benefit or detrimental effect such that already common traits acquire the mutations that steer the development of the population through natural selection. Light skin in one area more often than another because it provides a benefit in terms of vitamin D production but dark skin in others because it provides better protection against the damaging radiation from the sun or the acquisition of a trait that allows humans to survive on less oxygen but isn’t necessary in another environment will be more common in areas with less oxygen like at the top of mountains. The single mutations on the way to producing these traits usually don’t get noticed but they spread throughout the population because of heredity and genetic drift. As the accumulating changes do provide a survival benefit or take one away they’ll gradually spread throughout the population accordingly except in cases where detrimental mutation results in death or infertility and then they don’t get passed on at all. 

Why organs in a different location or a different sized brain when the less significant mutations don’t get noticed on their own? Because without having much effect on survival and reproduction, the other traits are selected for instead as whatever is left surviving spreads their genes throughout a population - about 50% from each parent. Never the exact same ones being passed on unless considering identical twins. Whatever does get passed on from an essentially 50% combines with the 50% from the other parent and the phenotype is a consequence of the mix of genes. A recessive gene mutation may not get noticed at all until enough time has passed for a descendant to acquire two copies of the same gene and other traits may change almost right away. By the time these genes have spread throughout the population so that recessive traits start appearing or as more mutations pile upon what is already there as they too spread around the population is driven in a certain direction with some variation at the individual level but a more consistent trend across the population. Generally, because of population mechanics, the unique variations go unnoticed until they become common. By this time, further mutation can only build upon what is already present. 

There doesn’t need to be natural selection at every step of the way favoring one set and killing off the rest. It usually doesn’t kill everything all at once anyway allowing some of the persistent detrimental genes to acquire more mutations to turn them into beneficial ones as well. Why are groups so similar? Because of how evolution works. It doesn’t allow dramatic phenotypical change across a single generation such that a survivor of such a dramatic change is still able to breed and produce viable offspring with members of its own species that lack such a dramatic change. In some cases, such a dramatic change kills the embryo can even develop. 

Split the population up into smaller groups and they diverge both genetically and morphologically such that some mutations only occur in one group, or if they exist in the entire group, are quite rare in some and common in others - genetic drift and heredity. If in both cases survival and reproduction is still possible two or more related groups continue to drift apart so that their ability to interbreed correlated with the time they’ve been genetically isolated and once they can no longer inter-breed at all they may adapt to the same environment but in a different way as the genes from one group can no longer flow into the other. This is where more distantly related groups look and act more differently than the closely related groups and this is where homology plays a role as evidence of the time since divergence as well as the shared ancestry the groups all share. 

Now, with evolution explained, you should have at least a basic grasp on what you’re arguing against. A bit more understanding on why separate ancestry doesn’t withstand scrutiny. And perhaps even enough understanding to know that this entire process isn’t driven towards a teleological goal. The whole time superficial changes accumulate on top of fundamental similarities (with a bit of an explanation for how this happens) and why despite it not being particularly beneficial to have some specific organization in their body plans why different body plans arise and why this is sufficient evidence of common ancestry (though other excuses could be made for this with less support) 

This is why it isn’t just one piece of the puzzle or just one piece of evidence but an overwhelming preponderance of it that establishes evolutionary an inescapable fact of population genetics, despite some saying it is simple the best explanation we have. Life undergoes change and when looking at the facts such as the fundamental similarities, the mechanisms by which mutation, heredity, genetic drift, natural selection, sexual selection, and artificial selection act upon populations and the law of monophyly which states that all populations are a subset of their parent populations and can never transform into something completely new (because of how evolution works) and the law of biodiversity (these processes add both the variety within a population and are the mechanisms by which speciation occurs), there is no other way to explain the biodiversity we find on our planet but through evolution. 

Now, with that established we have also looked into the evolution for common ancestry and even several overlapping hypotheses for how it all originated in the first place, that creationism doesn’t stand up as an alternative explanation. It doesn’t provide anything accurate that can’t already be explained by the theory of evolution or by our findings in studying the processes by which simple chemistry *can* lead to life without supernatural intervention. And that’s where we turn to all of the evidence for the age of our planet and the surrounding solar system or for there never being a global flood and how the Bible is wrong in almost every way in these regards just like there is no firmament. It doesn’t exist. It wasn’t created on day two of creation week by an incantation spell. Of course, there are plenty of Christians okay with this. Fallible humans made stuff up and what they wrote isn’t meant to be taken literally or interpreted as actual history. And for that, I’d suggest BioLogos, unless you want to debate against my atheism in the proper forum.",1579908630
t1_ffdmz7c,WorkingMouse,"That does clear things up, thanks.  One tidbit for clarification from my end:

&gt;My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication.

This gets a ""sorta""; it's not a distinction I'd generally draw.  In a general sense, a mutation is an inherited difference in the sequence of the genome.  This is generally either a result of the replication machinery making a mistake (inserting the wrong base, jumping strands, etc.), by damage which causes such a mistake (example: UV light causes [pyrimidine dimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer) that cause the replication machinery to copy ""CT"" as ""TT""), or by inaccurate repair such as after a double-strand break.

For most of these things, there are ways they can be caught and repaired; slower-reproducing organisms often have system dedicated to specifically repairing more common mutations, or ""proof-reading"" capacity in their replication machinery.  This means that it's always going to be a race against time in a replicating cell; if they're not caught before the cells divide (again, in the case of mistakes during replication itself) then it's a mutation that will be carried by the daughter cell that gets the different copy.

Basically, you're right to say that changes can occur during or prior to replication, though changes prior often don't ""stick"" or necessarily even amount to a mutation until they cause a mistake during replication (or are repaired inaccurately).

And yes, given that our OP appears to think that enzymes with novel traits arising doesn't count as mutation, somehow, there's still something seriously amiss there.",1579907944
t3_eti3z7,Russelsteapot42,"It seems pretty straightforward to me: They tried to say that H1N1 demonstrates genetic entropy by claiming it is 'less fit' now than it used to be, and used mortality data to argue that point. 

This both ignores that the environment changed (There was significant government action to curb H1N1), but also falsely equivocates 'fitness' with 'mortality', as if killing one's host is the goal of a parasitic virus.

The refusal to accept that the only viable measure of 'fitness' is 'ability to survive and produce the next generation and ensure the next generation survives' is a core point of creationist denialism.",1579907627
t3_etc8gl,ursisterstoy,"We are talking about gradual change to the genetics such that one individual acquires the mutation before it spreads via population genetics. Most often these changes are minor or at least neither beneficial or detrimental for survival and reproduction though sometimes there are quite drastic changes because of some minor gene variation or the merging of chromosomes that limit the ability to produce viable offspring but doesn’t quite eliminate that possibility. 

So we have both minor changes and drastic ones but usually the drastic eventual changes don’t happen all at once. A few examples have probably been provided over at r/evolution but for our purposes consider wing development, eye development, brain enlargement and several traits like these that set different organisms apart. 

For wings, it depends on which group we are talking about as most often in tetrapod lineages this is the result of webbing or flaps of skin between the digits of the fingers or along the side of the body such as in colugos and other gliding animals. At first webbed fingers may not be much use for animals that don’t return to the water but if they live up in a tree like the ancestors of pterosaurs and bats or several of these other examples, those that acquired successive variation on top of small less useful membranes of skin could use this adaptation to survive a fall or to assist in jumping from tree to tree until they got better at gliding and slowly accumulating more mutations so that they could turn falling in style into actual flight. For the other tetrapods, the birds, these wings are more like lightweight arms covered in feathers. The lightweight bones come with being non-aquatic archosaurs. The feathers come with being dinosaurs. And tracing their lineage as best as we can, some of the more famous examples of what would actually be cousins and not direct ancestors would be Tyrannosaurus, Oviraptor, and several other fully feathered theropods but manirapors and velociraptors were even more like birds and even starting to get small enough to get more of a benefit from their wings than simply staying warm or incubating a clutch of eggs. Some of them could run up steep inclines and maybe even glide before more adaptions like the loss of a long reptilian tail, the fusing of their fingers, and losing the ability to lay multiple eggs at the same time continued to make them lighter as they also acquired further adaptions to their wings and powerful chest muscles (in neognathes) allowing them to fly for longer distances as other adaptions to their brains allowed them to navigate these long distances. The other modern branch of birds either couldn’t fly or wasn’t nearly as good at it so they mostly stuck to the ground growing larger in some cases, losing their wings, or both. 

For the eye, we have living examples of what would be intermediate forms as well as the more complex different varieties. Cephalopods and vertebrates both developed camera eyes but vertebrate eyes are wired backward as to create a blind spot that the brain has to accommodate for, quite well, without us knowing. Further adaptions may be the post orbital bar that became fused to the brain case, the cartilage creating the basis of an eye socket and three eyelids (the third one is just a vestige in humans but the enclosed eye socket sets us apart from several other animals like most carnivores). Before the camera eye, a more ancestral trait would be lacking the lens used for better focus or the lack of color sensitivity so that everything is black and white or shades of gray. The nautilus has eyes like this. They are round like ours but lack the lens covering them. This is still a benefit over having less focus where insects went a different way having several compound eyes instead. All of this likely started out with light sensitive proteins like in the eyespots of several single celled organisms before one of those intermediates from being just light sensitive cells is found in flat worms that have them set inside the equivalent of a funnel. Simple light sensitive proteins at first may not tell the organisms much more than what several plants use to grow towards suns light away from the shade or provide a signal for several protists to escape the light where they might get detected but subsequent adaptions provide these animals that have them the ability to see what they’re looking at. Related is how the line leading to mammals lost the pineal eye than lizards still have when they became warm blooded. Such an eye doesn’t help much in terms of vision and when you don’t need it for detecting certain warm wavelengths of light it can just go away. 

And for brain development there is a whole lot that can be said about it, but without getting into too many specifics it starts out as nothing more than a clustering of neurons before some of them like in worms start to provide some of the regulatory and sensory functions that come with more developed brains. Larger, more developed brains don’t just suddenly appear all at once but build upon this template adding whole new features or enlarging existing ones over time. Even a small increase provides a benefit until it starts to interfere with flight or survivability at child birth. It also generally grows larger in social groups and even larger in those who are already intelligent for problem solving and the calorie intake that comes with processing meat. However, in our case, there are also several genes that were “damaged” along the way that play a role. We lack the musculature of most non-human apes unless because of damaged genes and the emergence of regulatory genes that have duplicated at some time in the past. Part of this is responsible for our weak bite in comparison as well as our jaw muscles not being connected to a crest above our skulls that we no longer have or need. This allows our skulls to grow larger as a tumor suppressor gene being damaged not only makes us more susceptible to brain cancer but provides us with the 10% increase that sets us apart from the other apes that we use for higher order thinking skills which leads to technology when we also have dexterous hands no longer as strong as they are in other apes giving us fine motor skills. These two things working in tandem lead to increased brain mass over the other apes, especially once our ancestors started cooking food making it possible to absorb more calories with less effort. Why don’t the other animals have nearly as complex brains or display the same capacity for technology and abstract concepts? A lot of superficial changes and some rather noticeable ones occurred in our lineage that wasn’t found in theirs and each of these provided a survival benefit on their own (expect maybe the one that now results in more brain cancer) so that they would be selected for. We’re not as fast or as strong as other animals are but we can run for longer without getting tired, we don’t overheat as fast, and we have the dexterity necessary to develop intricate technologies. And because we are a social species the increased intelligence and comprehension and other things that come with having a larger brain allow us to develop larger social networks again creating another benefit for survival. Walking bipedally also helps with our ability to possess a large brain to body mass compared to those that walk on all fours because this method of walking, especially as it is in us, burns fewer calories and provides less neck strain than holding our necks out in front of us with a huge weight bearing down on our necks as we walk. 

Of course, there are also several problems that come with having each of these traits in the wrong environment or when it comes to survival just being born so that fish that live in the dark lost their eyes, birds that don’t fly have reduced wings or lack them entirely (or have a useless appendage in their place that takes less resources to make). And our brains cause a higher infant mortality rate even when they continue developing into adulthood or when the bones of our skulls remain detached until shortly birth so that social groups and technology plays a more vital role in our survival than is necessary for animals that only meet up to have sex.",1579903088

t3_etc8gl,OddJackdaw,"&gt; I'm talking about variation in individual animals within a single new generation.

No, radical changes are usually detrimental, so they tend to be selected against. 

&gt; I'm trying to understand, from a genuine evolutionary perspective, how the simple, minute tweaks associated with new structures would accumulate. It seems like they're not going to contribute to selection at all because all of the overwhelming force of the immediate utility associated with factors like size, sexual attractiveness, intelligence, etc.

Minor changes can either be neutral or benefit, and they will still get passed on. A trait that is neutral today may not be neutral in the future, so it is a misunderstanding to think that a change must have an immediate effect. 

&gt; it seems quite striking that we're not all beautiful, intelligent, smart, etc. Why? Well, those are the factors we have been selecting for in each other for a very very very long time.

While it is true that beautiful and intelligent people tend to reproduce *easier*, they don't necessarily reproduce *more*. The reality is that almost anyone who wants to reproduce has historically been able to reproduce.  A trait will only be weeded out of the gene pool if there is such a strong selective force that it seriously hurts the ability to reproduce, and neither unattractiveness or lack of intelligence seriously hinder a person's ability to attract a mate. If anything, it causes unattractive and dumb people to mate with each other which will make the traits even more likely to be passed on. And-- particularly in the modern era-- these people tend to have larger families.

&gt; The second objection that shift in environmental conditions will change the nature of the ""ideal specimen"" such that meaningful transformations in the ""practical invariants"" of a species (which you can relatively define as those things which remain almost identical from parent to child) will be selected for over and against immediate factors, that just seems non-empirical because things like speed, strength, intelligence, general symmetry, are meta-adaptations.

This paragraph isn't entirely clear, but again, you seem to be hung up on the idea of ""immediate factors."" Other than in genes that are so detrimental that you die or are physically unable to reproduce, ""immediate"" just isn't a thing in evolution. Any trait that is not so detrimental that it prevents you from reproducing has a decent likelihood of being passed on.",1579899755

At the end of the day, evolution is not abiogenesis irrespective of how you want to interpret a book title.   


&gt; Do you see it as a fact, that humans are more morally significant than animals?

Absolutely. It's part of my moral worldview which I don't extend to most animals, except my dog. Elevating humankind's morality and welling above that of other animals is in no way dishonest or has anything to do with evolution since evolution is not a moral claim.   


&gt;I guess if you must to be honest, ""no"" is also acceptable, but that would be a problematic response, because it would cause cognitive dissonance in your own mind, not to mention provide fodder for the key complaint of the Wedge Document authors.

Yikes, the only thing I've asked you is if you believe evolution is an origins claims. Modern evolutionary synthesis is not an origins claim. You might have mistaken me for another poster, but I'm happy to engage here.   


&gt;if you could agree that human life is valuable in a significant way, and could explain that persuasively by appealing to scientific naturalism and not religious dogma, that would take a lot of wind out of the sails of people writing and pushing that view. 

I'm not all sure why people want to conflate scientific fact with a moral system or why a scientific fact is suddenly more ""true"" if a moral component can be mapped onto it?   


It's quite easy to appeal to scientific naturalism for a moral system. So I'm still not quite sure what the issue here is.   


&gt; conspiracy to Literally Overthrow Science and usher in Theocratic Hegemony or not

&gt; because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people.    
  
&gt;  
&gt; I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes. 

That's actually not how it works. Blood perfusion to the brain is tightly controlled by barometric sensors in your carotid arteries and downstream affectors. Blood is never diverted from the brain to other organ systems as it  has the absolute highest priority for perfusion in the body. The brain will literally shunt blood away from your other organs and cause them to die before it disrupts its own blood supply. Vasoconstriction in the brain is met with hemodynamic  autoregulation responses which preserve perfusion over small ranges as the brain is extremely sensitive to changes in glucose/oxygen.   


Anyways, during sympathetic nervous system activation acetylcholine gets released at various innervated locations. Acetylcholine causes the adrenal medullas to release catecholamines. The catecholamines cause vasoconstriction at various unneeded anatomical sites like the GI tract, kidneys, and skin. That blood is then shunted to skeletal muscles, heart, and lungs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most of the literature I've read along those lines has more to do with managing knowledge workers, but the data is intuitive, and appears to be robustly supported by research, not only for knowledge workers but also even for people in literal physical combat 

This sounds pretty woo-woo Jordan-Peterson esque, what are you trying to say? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Fear and stress make you stupid and reduce your capacity for clear, effective rational thought. 

Maybe, but that's kind of the whole point of the SNS--get out/away/fight. It's not meant to be used to sit down and write math proofs. It causes hyperfocus on the task at hand, moving that attention to other non-imminent tasks isn't a priority. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat.  

SNS response is not a binary dichotonomy. It exists along a spectrum, is modulated by parasympathetic activity, and interacts with numerous endocrine axes to produce several degrees of response. SNS activation of ""I have a test in 3 weeks"" compared to ""I need to fight or die"" is different.  


&gt;  But it seems irrational to be so certain about your position but at the same time to be terrified or stressed by someone who wants to use academic research and argumentation to change peoples' minds about it. It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we? 

Anti-scientific doctrines are inherently dangerous and cause harm to humankind. Interacting in the world under a false-understanding of reality demonstrably confers harm to others. If you don't believe that is a worthy cause of trying to combat, perhaps your moral system is lacking. However, it is a free country (presumably you live in a relatively free country) and you are allowed to prioritize and harbor values as you see fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Do you feel like humans are generally bad and stupid, and like maybe the majority of humans require smarter people to force them to make good choices, sort of as their overlords or something?  

Not at all. There are very few people who are ""bad."" The problem is that good people are animated by bad ideas--which religion seems to have a near infinite supply of. All ideas should be met with skepticism and many ideas are privy to scientific inquiry. Science is a reliable way to determine truth. If someone wants to play scientist, they shouldn't expect anything less than a scientific treatment of their idea.

This

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686537](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686537) 

Is a review of viral mutation rates. They mutate, and Carter and Sanford did actually measure that, so that's probably worth a citation. No mention of entropy.

This

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556217](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556217)

Actually you have it backwards. The spanner causes the replication to go slower, and that has a side effect of helping the viruses spread in some cases.

That is their only function, and the faster they replicate the more efficiently that replication machinery is working.

But I was looking to see how scary it ought to be, and given the thesis in the intro and the fact that they cite research as fundamental to their plan, and explicitly argue against indoctrination of dogma, I am not finding a rational case for fear. If you believe that the best ideas won in an environment of free interchange of ideas, what is there to be afraid of?

Maybe people since 1998 have considered themselves nominally to be following the document but in practice contradicting the principles, but in my view, if you could correct them by appealing to the document they're following, then the problem is not in that document.

&gt;these guys are more into the culture war than dispassionately learning about the RealWorld we all live in.

Of course it's about ""the culture war"", that's in the very beginning of the doc... They see the devaluation of humanity to be a dangerous idea that they see as an inevitable conclusion of materialism, and promoting ID research is the weapon with which they want to fight against the devaluation of humanity.

You obviously don't think it's a valid strategy, but you do think devaluing human life is bad, right?

You didn't answer my question about whether it's a fact that humans are more morally significant than animals. Do you believe it?

It's not intended to be a trap question and I don't believe it's irrelevant either. If you don't like answering it in the affirmative because doing so might expose something you have in common with the ID movement, then to me, that seems like a departure from reason and from good ethics.

On the other hand, if you would answer no, doesn't that make you feel uncomfortable? Even if you might disagree with the strategy, I imagine you could still sympathize with the drive towards ideals in a way that replaces some fear with understanding.

IF it were part of the model, it would be part of the DFE chart. It's not. And even today, beneficial mutations and ""adaptive evolution"" lie OUTSIDE the model(s).

t1_ffev9k1,ursisterstoy,"Actually “mutation is a mechanism for common ancestry” would be about as dishonest as saying the atavisms aren’t really atavisms if they don’t have some specific trait. 

Mutation is the mechanism that creates diversity. No matter what kind of mutation. No matter if the result is conceptually good, bad, or neutral. We have examples of all three and I’ve even provided plenty of evidence for this myself. You’ve provided some yourself for this when discussing the mtDNA MRCA for specific clades you wanted to discuss as if they were completely isolated groups. A poodle and bulldog are quite different from each other because they possess different alleles of the same genes - mutation creates the diversity. Artificial selection, a process by which humans create breed, is a purification process selecting out which mutant varieties we want over which ones we don’t. By selecting specific traits we remove the other traits from the isolated gene pools we create in this fashion so that within these populations the diversity is less than if we consider the entire group like all domesticated gods, which are obviously all the same “kind” of animal. 

It is the patterns of mutation and selection found in genetics and in fossils that provide us with a clear evolutionary progression where we don’t have to watch every birth take place or produce every single mother of a mother to get a clear understanding that breeds of dogs originated from a few wolves. They’re still wolves, but now they are also domesticated dogs too. 

The higher levels of classification are created by the same process but the descendants living today have grown further apart with time. We can still trace this back anyway with a couple stumbling blocks in certain cases - not because no link exists, but because a few different intermediate forms could all fit as the actual intermediate and they all are living at the same time as cousins to each other.

t3_esr9ns,azusfan,"Several have criticised me for suggesting the Lenski study was referred to by common ancestry believers, as evidence of common ancestry.  Rather than reply to each, I'll do it once, here.

1. Several people, in previous threads, have referenced this as evidence of common ancestry. It was the reason i posted the review.  This study was referenced in the immediately previous thread on natural selection, and was why i quoted my review in this thread.
2. Other subsequent studies have overtly made a claim of 'speciation!', which Lenski himself disputed.  This is also quoted in my review:

""The claim of 'new speciation!', is only an arbitrary definition, not anything compelled by any changes in the morphology or genetic structure of the organism. To claim this is 'real evolution!' is absurd. It is obviously just adaptation, &amp; only demonstrates the viability &amp; adaptability of this particular organism. Some organisms do NOT have this capability, but die under unfriendly conditions. So this phenomenon does not apply universally, as would be expected if this were a mechanism for macro evolution, but is unique to e.coli. 

*Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit+ as a ""speciation event"" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said ""that becoming Cit+ was only a first step on the road to possible speciation"", and thus did not propose that the Cit+ mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution*

So the claim of 'new speciation!' is not even claimed by Lenski, the one doing the study, even though hordes of eager Believers cling to it as 'scientific proof!' of common descent.""

3. If 'nobody claims that!' was true, why would Lenski rebut that claim?  Obviously, some do.  My statement stands and is accurate.

It's okay to say yes there.

I guess if you must to be honest, ""no"" is also acceptable, but that would be a problematic response, because it would cause cognitive dissonance in your own mind, not to mention provide fodder for the key complaint of the Wedge Document authors.

There's plenty--so much--to disagree with in the position of their document, but it strikes me that, if you could agree that human life is valuable in a significant way, and could explain that persuasively by appealing to scientific naturalism and not religious dogma, that would take a lot of wind out of the sails of people writing and pushing that view. 

Also interested in your thoughtful consideration of the other idea -- that whether it's a secret ""Christian Taliban"" conspiracy to Literally Overthrow Science and usher in Theocratic Hegemony or not, doesn't mean that it's not best responded to with a fully-engaged mind.

Insults and ego-trips come from a place of insecurity, and they interfere with clear thought, because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people. I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes.

Most of the literature I've read along those lines has more to do with managing knowledge workers, but the data is intuitive, and appears to be robustly supported by research, not only for knowledge workers but also even for people in literal physical combat: Fear and stress make you stupid and reduce your capacity for clear, effective rational thought.

Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat. But it seems irrational to be so certain about your position but at the same time to be terrified or stressed by someone who wants to use academic research and argumentation to change peoples' minds about it. It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we?

Oh, or maybe that goes back to the ""human life"" thing.

t1_ffeh4ix,ursisterstoy,"Extensions of the tail bone? 

Actually in a paper I found from 1962 that was still trying to charge people to read it, I saw a mention of the second known reported tail atavism saying that there wasn’t an extension of the spine in that case in the abstract. I’m not sure how reliable this is so I didn’t include it. 


https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/atavism-embryology-development-and-evolution-843/


https://creation.com/human-tails - this link is intentionally misleading. Nobody said that all human tail atavisms are “fully functional.” Why would they be? Genes turned back on so that the coccyx doesn’t remain short and fused just makes it so that the tails we still have look like tails are still atavisms or evidence of a time when our ancestors still had relatively useless tails. It would take even more mutations to acquire the even older trait of the tail being useful. This is like how dolphins born with their anal fins counts as an atavism of a time when their ancestors still had them, but we don’t except nor do we find dolphins with four fully functional legs complete with feet for walking. 

An atavism is evidence that the genes exist to produce lost ancestral traits that shouldn’t exist at all if there was no evolutionary relationship. It is just one small piece of the puzzle in the big picture.",1579858958

I guess it depends on how you define ""create"" and ""new"". 

My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication. The OP's example ignored the second category altogether. His analogy ""This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'"" is clearly referring to mutations that occur within an existing gene. It would be fair to say it results in a ""new gene sequence"" but is the gene itself new? 

Really, whether it is ""new"" or not is a semantic distinction. I can see the point you are making, and I wouldn't say you are wrong, but you aren't really saying the same thing the OP is.

You're half-right.  It would be a fallacy if I claimed you were doing such things and then refused to back it up, and I can't really blame you for being on the defensive about such.  But what I actually did was predict what points others would raise against you.  And indeed, we can see replies to that effect; /u/Sweary_Biochemist and /u/OddJackdaw have pointed out that no one is holding up Prof. Lenski's work as proving common descent, both of them and /u/ThurneysenHavets and /u/TheBlackCat13 pointed out flaws in your understanding of mutation (as have I and folks responding here, but we'll get to that), and at the same time at least two of them pointed out that we know that new genes forming is a thing - which is, as it so happens, what my post above was also on about using a particular example.

But that's really an aside.  To the meat of it:

&gt;The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.

And the _inability_ of any bacteria to digest nylon byproducts, including the bacteria that evolved under laboratory conditions to do so, is quite well-documented.

&gt;It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions. There is no structural changes to the genome.

How does a bacterium produce new enzymes without changes to its genome?

&gt;It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

To the contrary; these enzymes are proteins translated from RNA transcribed from the DNA of the bacterial genome.  The fact that the parental bacteria didn't have enzymes for this and their dependents do is a change in the genome.  Such a change in the genome between generations is practically the definition of a mutation.

&gt; But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria. Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.

__How?__  I want you to be explicit here; if you are _only_ going to answer one part of my post, if you do not have the time or patience, please, _please_ address this section: ___How_, outside of mutation, do you propose bacteria with enzymes that digest nylon got them if not by mutation?  What is the ""more credible explanation"" you refer to?__

&gt; It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

Speciation in bacteria is something of a toss-up.  

I would agree entirely that it's a stretch to say such things show common ancestry - which is why no one's making that claim, and I'd prefer it if you did not bear false witness about us in that manner, if you please.

As to gene creation, it is not merely that they secrete the enzymes.  Those enzymes themselves are not present in their relatives; the genes those enzymes are produced from are simply not present.  Again, in the case of the strain evolved in the lab, we can say with certainty that their ancestor did not posses it because _we still have their frozen ancestors from the start of the experiment_.  

---

&gt;It is not a mechanism for common ancestry.

It is one of several that play a part, actually.

&gt; Mutation is an entropic process, that degrades an organism.

No, that is not demonstrated and in fact we have numerous examples of beneficial mutations - including the aforementioned genes that allow for digesting nylon byproducts.

&gt; It does not increase complexity, ...

Mutations include gene duplications, which can and does result in there being multiple copies of a gene that then can mutate independently to give rise to two different genes in the same gene family where once was one.  Having two related genes rather than one gene is, by any definition, more complex.

&gt; ... or create new genes, ...

The just-mentioned process above, among others, can and does observably give rise to novel genes that were not possessed by an organism's ancestors.

This is more egregious projection than Devin Nunes. My position remains the same, but I have been addressing the various and variable flimsy counter arguments you've been clumsily attempting to hurl at me. It seemed the polite thing to do. 

If I take the time to explain Kimura's model to you (and it is tragic that this is necessary), that does not mean I endorse it. Meanwhile you apparently *do*, yet don't actually even understand it. It was published in 1979, Paul: you've had long enough.

In contrast, no evidence for genetic entropy has ever been presented. Your ""much"" evidence is...lacking, while your excuses as to why ""populations that absolutely SHOULD exhibit genetic entropy mysteriously but reliably fail to do so"" continue to grow in self-contradictory spirals. Mice, even laboratory mice kept in optimal conditions and fed ad lib, where selective pressure is basically zero (a great analogy for humans) fail to show any sign of any 'entropic mutational accumulation'. They *drift*, sure, but they absolutely thrive as they do so. They have about half the mutations per generation we do, but can have five generations a year (and in the lab, they do). If GE actually existed, we'd see it pretty fast. The fact we don't suggests it's either so slow that actual speciation will render it irrelevant, or it isn't actually a thing. Either outcome invalidates a young, created human species (along with literally all the other evidence that clearly invalidates a young, created human species).

First we know, thanks to examinations of preserved and exhumed samples that the 1917 virus was no more virulent then any other flu outbreak. What cause nearly all the deaths in 1917 were bacterial infections. And penicillin and other antibodies wouldn't be available for another decade.

It's also misleading to say that mortality rates dropped in a smooth and gradual manner. H1N1 isn't persistent in human populations, so we are only really working with 4 data points over the last century. So advances in medical tech wouldn't show up until the next outbreak decades later. Paul and Sanford try and say that because we don't see a precipitous drop in mortality rates say during the 30's with the invention of antibiotics that indicates the drop is due to genetic entropy. While the obvious truth is that the reason we don't see said drop that corresponds to better medical tech is because there wasn't a H1N1 outbreak until 1957.

It is also worth noting that Paul's continued assertion the H1N1 is extinct is really undercut by its continued existence. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/burden-of-h1n1.html why he persists in saying that is bewildering.

I'm sure that the flu would not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be, had WWI not taken place. Surely there's little doubt that it did exacerbate things.

t1_ffb9m97,Hypersapien,"You see, what your problem is, is that you think a ""species"" is this strictly defined thing with hard edges. It's not. A species is an abstraction that humans came up with to classify things. Granted that it's less of an abstraction than other taxonomic classifications in that it actually has something in biology that you can observe to define it. If two organisms are capable of producing an offspring which is, itself, capable of breeding, then they're the same species. When we see something that we can call a species, we give it a name.

The simple fact is that nature, especially biology, is too messy to perfectly fit into our neat little human-made categories. Read up on ""[ring species](https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Ring_species.asp)"" to see what I'm talking about.

Another thing that you don't seem to understand is that the idea of separate and distinct species means nothing when you're talking about a line of ancestry, since a genotype is constantly changing through the generations. The idea of different species only really means anything when you're looking at different populations in the same time period.",1579810774

I wasn't talking about the luxury of staying home, more so a sickness that's so awful you really don't have an option. Have you ever had norovirus? I have. Not a fun time. 

Granted we have more personal space now than for a good chunk of history (especially during the industrial revolution), but I actually don't know how far back into history those cramped conditions extend. It may be true further back for places like Europe, especially in the winter, but globally I'm not so sure. If you have any figures on like, population density throughout time, that'd be helpful. 

Then there's the issue of H1N1 being a zootonic(?) virus (I may have butchered the word), which behave differently in us than their usual hosts. Things like colds seem to do so well because they're both tuned for humans, and also don't do much to impair their host. The worst cold I ever had actually drove me to go out in public to look for symptom relief. I don't think many violent flu strains can do the same. But then again I'm not a virologist.

t3_ess5i9,ursisterstoy,"Tetrapods are defined as having four limbs but snakes don’t have any legs anymore. Synapsids are defined as having a couple holes in their head that humans no longer have. Most mammals have hair, but we have hairless cats and whales that are still mammals. 

A gain of a trait or a loss of an ancestral one happens often enough to develop an evolutionary family tree. It is like those nested dolls where the most distant ancestral clades contain each of the next most recent clades that contain the next most recent clades. Humans still have the majority of these defining characteristics of each of their clades but some traits along the way were lost. Sometimes we even find transitions for some of the steps along the way. Sometimes the in between forms don’t fossilize but we can still compare genetic similarities since we also know how mutations raise biodiversity that can be selected for in sub populations differently when they occupy different niches or when the mutation appears after the split from the other members of any particular clade. 

We are eukaryotes, scotokaryotes, neokaryotes because of how our cells are arranged and the organelles contained not found in other groups. Our lack of chloroplasts is another trait that separates us from what would become plants but our similarities with plants shows that the common ancestor of both also lacked the chloroplasts that are a defining characteristic of the divergent lineage. 

Each descendant clade that follows provides us a basic overview of how the earliest cells gave rise to humans and the sister clades in each case help to explain the biodiversity that arose via this process. We are monkeys (simians) but often times people won’t admit this when they only consider a couple living types of Old World monkeys as monkeys along with all the New World Monkeys. Apes are a sister clade to what everyone will accept as Old World Monkeys (Cercopithecidae and colobus monkeys). Within this group we have great apes and lesser apes to distinguish between the subset of apes that diverged to give rise to gibbons and siamangs as our lineage continued down the path of Oranguntans, Gorillas, Chimpanzees and Humans. We are still great apes. Homininae contains all of these except Orangutans among what is still alive. Hominini contains chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans as well as several extinct forms and we’re all more than 98% similar genetically when considering our coding genes and around 96% identical when comparing the entire genome which only makes sense because we are all the same type of animal. The next more recent clade excludes chimpanzees and bonobos, but himinina includes Graecopithecus, Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and Homo. This is also probably the order that these take us from the human-chimp common ancestor to our genus. The next step is our species but technically we’d still be a population Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo rhodesiensis as well, despite the “you can’t outgrow your ancestry” usually applying to the higher clades more specifically. 

The entire time, a sub population the origin of each clade splits off from the original group. This tends to start out more along the lines of ethnic group, leading to a breed, to a subspecies, and so forth before the isolated group is no longer inter-fertile or able to inter-breed at all and then the clades get more defined as they drift apart genetically when they can no longer mix back together. This is why you can’t outgrow your ancestry. You are a descendant of the original population of every ancestral clade and you’ll continue to be a descendant no matter how different you have become or how ever many descendant populations arise from the current one many years into the future. 

A half man-half ape? Look in the mirror. All humans are still apes.

&gt;And if you don't think 2009 was Spanish flu explain why Sanford felt they were similar enough to compare, but the virus that existed afterwards wasn't.

Again, if you read their paper you'd know. The Swine Flu was a variant that was originally related to the 1917 Spanish flu lineage that went extinct (in humans) in the 1950s, but apparently jumped to swine and then back to humans again in 2009. The fact that it was associated with relatively low mortality in 2009 is explained by the high mutational load:

&gt;Nearest neighbor calculations (data not shown) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage. They cluster tightly with the 2009–2010 outbreak porcine viruses, all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses. Thus, we included the 2009–2010 viruses and the nine isolated, non-outbreak viruses in the “porcine” category. In this same figure, we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after (Figure ​(Figure2,2, circle) fall directly on the trajectory of the non-frozen lineage. This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re-introduction virus. Kedwaii, et al.[8] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses, an H1N2 and an H1N1, from different continents, but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve. Regardless, general attenuation due to genome-wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [54-56] associated with the 2009 pandemic. The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1,889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain.",1579809738

&gt;Feathered dinosaur ancestors” Sinosauropteryx and Caudipteryx are “dated” at 125 Ma (million years old) While confuciusornis was dated 127 Ma.

[While Sinosauropteryx had feather-like structures, it was not very closely related to the previous ""first bird"" Archaeopteryx.[1] There are many dinosaur clades that were more closely related to Archaeopteryx than Sinosauropteryx was, including the deinonychosaurians, the oviraptorosaurians, and the therizinosauroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx#Feathers). This is entirely consistent with the theory that modern birds are descended from the same lineage that gave us Velociraptor. 

Caudipteryx' classification is controversial to the point it's a fool's errand to use it as evidence for or against dino-bird evolution. 

Confuciusornis is many things, but it's decidedly not a modern bird given that Hesperornis and Ichthyornis are more closely related to those than Confuciusornis is.

Funny how we don't find thyreophoran fossils in Triassic rocks. It's also funny how T. rex only appears in strata that are dated to the Cretaceous period.

From the document:
&gt;&gt;Phase I is the essential component of everything that comes afterward. Without solid scholarship, research and argument, the project would be just another attempt to indoctrinate instead of persuade.

It looks like it is not interested in overturning materialism with dogmatic indoctrination, but rather with scienctific inquiry.

Are you concerned that this might happen? If you are not, you have no need to fear it, do you? And if you are concerned that scienctific inquiry might overturn materialism, isn't that position itself dogmatic and anti-science? Why not just look at the evidence and see if it does?

The emotional investment many  people put into the argument doesn't feel like a fundamentally rational position. It feels like fear and identity and tribalism and a lot of things that add up to bias.

What would arguments look like if we engaged without feeling threatened? I cannot help but think they would improve in clarity, and offer us more opportunities to learn, refine, and persuade others than the typical near-seething combative engagement of one whowe existence is threatened.

Maybe fight-or-flight was useful to our ancestors, but psychologically safe, inquisitive courage is what got us most of the intellectual progress we value today, isn't it? Why go back to rage-debate when dealing with something so important if we don't have some part of us that feels it is genuinely at risk?

&gt;point of the ID movement is to replace scientific materialism, root and branch, with ""theistic understanding""s.

I'm reading that doc rather differently. To me, it looks like the goal is not to replace science with theology, but to stake out a way for science and scienctific progress to be compatible with the idea that it is a fact that humans are more morally significant than mere animals.

&gt; This is totally, completely wrong. Kimura did not even so much as attempt to model this. He only asserted it without providing any evidence. It lies outside the scope of his model completely, as you can see by the fact that his DFE doesn't even bother to include beneficial ones.

I'm sorry to jump in here, but this is so egregious I have to comment. 

Have you read the actual paper from Kimura that you're talking about? The one where he says that he excluded beneficial mutations, and his rationale for doing so?

Lemme pull it up real quick:

&gt;The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.

So there are four options here.

This is totally, completely wrong. Kimura did not even so much as attempt to model this. He only asserted it without providing any evidence. It lies outside the scope of his model completely, as you can see by the fact that his DFE doesn't even bother to include beneficial ones.

But you see, you're having to change your story on the fly, because originally you wanted to say that there is no decline due to neutrals; but what you actually have to claim is that there is a decline but it is offset by beneficial.

Synonymous mutations do not alter coding sequence. And we use synonymous mutations to asses the consequence of NON synonymous mutations: that is how we know that non-synonymous changes, (i.e. actual alterations) are more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

As for Kimura, first it's a model, secondly he openly states that if beneficial mutations (things we know exist) are allowed in his model, they fix incredibly fast and evolution goes wild, and thirdly his model is built on the assumption (note, not observed fact) that 'mutations are slightly deleterious but effectively neutral', and may lead to a decline in fitness (in his model) of 10\^-7 per generation.

H1N1 isn't. It was last years dominant flu strain. The ""extinction"" in 1917 is readily explained by herd immunity due to its widespread infection in previous years. If, hypothetically a 1/3 of people had some immunity you wouldn't/couldn't get an outbreak until enough new, not immune people had been born to bring the herd immunity below 20%, probably much lower.

t1_ffbnted,EyeProtectionIsSexy,"&gt; I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene. It is not a mechanism for trait creation.

Yeah, evolution works by modifying what already exists. But what we have here is a duplication event. This is literally the op And when we're talking about mutations in the structure, even a single mutation can cause drastic structural changes in protein folding, leading what literally a new protein that can perform a wide range of potential biochemical tasks.

&gt; ..this is believed, or hypothesized. The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures. There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt.  selection acts upon existing variability

Before we continue  down this trail, let's lay a couple of things of down so I know how to address you. It doesn't seem that you know what a gene is. 
Do you agree that;

1) Mutations occur in a variety of formats, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, inversions, deletions, duplications, all of which can either remove, modify or add nucleotide base pairs to an already existing template. 

2) Heritability occurs. 

Additionally, what exactly is a gene to you? Is a sequence of nucletides that have a start codon upstream and a stop codon downstream? Does a gene actually need to code for anything usefull? Does a gene always need to code for something? I'd really like to hammer down a precise definition of what a gene is at the molecular level. This will be helpful to make sure we're on the same page.

&gt; Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity. Diversity decreases via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves' mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry.

What do you mean by complexity? Would you mind giving me, not a real world example, but just a test example with the following sequence. I want to visualize what you're talking about:

AUGAGCTAGCTATCGATTAGTCGATGACGTAGTCGACGTACGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGTAGATACGCTCGCTACGTACGACTGACUAG

Now onto Lynch:

&gt; The fraction of amino-acid altering mutations that is deleterious enough to be removed by selection is approximated by C= 1-Kn/Ks, where Kn and Ks are the substitution rates at nonsynonomous and synonymous sites, respectively. If mutations are neutral on average, C, the proportion of ‘‘missing’’ amino-acid substitutions, would have an expected value of 0.0. However, in all taxa examined so far, average values of C are in excess of 0.7 (e.g., Ohta 1995; Eyre-Walkeret al. 2002), implying that the majority of amino-acid altering mutations are deleterious. 

So, take home messages here:

Most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious.

Well, yes.

And we can TELL most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious, BECAUSE THEY ARE SELECTED AGAINST.

And we can tell they are selected against, by comparing them to mutations that DO NOT alter amino acids.

Do you begin to see the problem? If all mutations were deleterious, we could not use C analysis. C is zero when *no* mutations are deleterious, or when *all* mutations are deleterious. C is not zero. 

Essentially, the Lynch position is that if a mutation ISN'T synonymous, then it probably does something. And that thing is more likely to be bad than good. This tells us nothing about synonymous mutations (other than they clearly accumulate more rapidly than nonsynonymous ones do), and tells us even less about mutations in regions that don't even code for anything.

Also, if you read the paper, it notes that generally ""mean"" fitness declines in MA experiments (as would be expected: most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious), but that individual line fitness *can* increase. MA experiments are conducted without selection pressure (that's sort of the point), and employ horrendous bottlenecking: if you add selection for fitness to this equation, it's pretty easy to see that in the wild less fit lines would be outcompeted by more fit lines.

Sure, but the flu pandemic was not limited to people fighting in WWI. That's hardly a sufficient explanation for the data. And it doesn't account for the extinction of the strain (either time).

Yes.

t3_ess5i9,andrewjoslin,"Great question!  Others here have pointed you toward cladistics, and that's exactly the thing you're asking about:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) .

The concept of ""clades"" and the subsequent study of ""cladistics"" came about because the classical Linnaean taxonomy -- kingdom, phylum, ..., genus, species -- is very well suited to placing a limited number of species in a nested hierarchy based on shared morphology, but not good at all for placing huge numbers of species in a hierarchy based on their ancestry.  This is because Linnaean taxonomy was developed before the theory of evolution, so it was not designed to include all the relationships needed to represent Universal Common Ancestry (UCA), nor all the species we now know about.  It makes the most sense to classify organisms based on ancestry, because that is primarily what determines all the other characteristics of the organism anyway (including morphology).

I was educated in the US, and we learned Linnaean taxonomy all the way up through high school.  When I learned about cladistics *at age 33 (!!!)* I was absolutely *floored*.  It immediately became obvious that *every clade represents a population of organisms that actually lived at some time*, whereas under Linnaean taxonomy it would be hard to argue that there was once a basal ""animal"" that started Kingdom Animalia.  Once I realized that, all of cladistics made sense:  it's a family tree full of ancestral organisms, rather than a bunch of bins that we categorize organisms into.

Check this out:   [https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/](https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/) .

It's a cladistic phylogeny explorer managed by Aron Ra.  Though many clades are uncertain or unnamed because science doesn't know enough about them, you'll quickly see that the ""web of life"" can't possibly be shoved into the Linnaean system without losing basically *all* information about common ancestry.  I challenge you to navigate all the way to Homo sapiens in that explorer :)",1579796223

t1_ffbwd18,GuyInAChair,"&gt;Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.

The 2009 strain was available for testing, and they didn't do it. It started off as extremely variant and declined over the course of a number of years. In that case they had an almost day by day sample library to draw from yet choose not to do a single fitness test. Its bewildering how someone can make the conclusion they did without doing a single test, when all the materials necessary for them to do them were easily available.

&gt;They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased.

No they simply assumed that, and came to their conclusion by ignoring other things that effect mortality. And yes they did ignore it, acknowledging that they exist isn't the same as factoring them into their model. We have rates of infection of H1N1 going back to the 1840's https://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/8107 and of course the data gets much better in the 20th century. Calculating herd immunity and infection rates is something that is easily doable by them and they simply didn't. That's ignoring data even if they acknowledge that it exists.

&gt;Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? 

Because H1N1 hadn't been seen in the world for 60+ years in 1917. No H1Nx strain had been seen for 40 years. Combine a population with no immunity at all, mobilize them for war in poor sanitary conditions no antibiotics, little to no knowledge of outbreak containment and you have a recipe for the disaster it became. Of course huge numbers of people contracted bacterial infections, millions of people were in close contact in the trenches, field hospitals, makeshift wards etc. 

There's also reasons why in parts of the world not as effected by the war the outbreak wasn't any worse then a typical bad fue season. Heck if you were over 65 in 1917 the worst pandemic in recent times wouldn't even qualify as a mild flu season.

&gt;if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1... ...I answered this here.

So there exists a way for a virus to increase in fitness. Lacking any knowledge of the future how in the friggen world can one make a determination about genetic entropy within a such a small snapshot in time? Considering H1N1 existed before 1917, exists currently, there seems to be absolutely no reason to pick the dates they did except to come to the conclusion they want.

&gt;Also addressed in the paper:

&gt;Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality

t1_ffbwkgl,Lockjaw_Puffin,"&gt;So you couldn't find even one? I bet you tried

I actually didn't, because I did my homework and know that it's next to impossible to find an unbroken fossil lineage since there's numerous factors preventing that from occurring. You should ask u/DarwinZDF42 or u/Capercaillie, they're both scientists (geneticist and vertebrate zoologist respectively) and they can corroborate what I just told you. 

&gt;According to the evolutionary timescale there shouldn't be any! 

According to *basic rules of biology and geography*, it would be nearly impossible. The evolutionary timescale has almost nothing to do with it. 

&gt;Fossilisation doesn't just happen

Not at all what I said, but keep strawmanning me if you want. The more people here who see your dishonesty, the better. 

&gt;wonder why we actually find so many? 

Because the number of individual organisms guaranteed that some of them would be fossilized. There is also the fact that certain environments (e.g. mountainous regions, metamorphic rock, etc) are simply [not conducive to fossilisation](https://www.americangeosciences.org/education/k5geosource/content/fossils/under-what-conditions-do-fossils-form). 

&gt;A great big flood?

Let me give you an idea of *exactly* how stupid it is to think that a global flood could possibly provide us with the fossil record as we see it.

Creationists tend to invoke three flood-sorting mechanisms to explain the ordering of the fossil record. Each one is different, and each one is utter nonsense.

**Ecological zonation**: Patterns of fossil deposition in Noah's Flood can be explained as follows - The lower strata, in general, would contain animals that lived in the lower elevations. Thus, marine invertebrates would be buried first, then fish, then amphibians and reptiles (who live at the boundaries of land and water), and finally mammals and birds. Also, animals would be found buried with other animals from the same communities.

Problem 1: Whales, despite living in the same ecological strata as fish, aren't found anywhere at the bottom of the geological column. The same goes for mosasaurs like Tylosaurus

Problem 2: Modern mammal fossils aren't found anywhere alongside dinosaur fossils.

Problem 3: Birds are very much alive today, but pterosaurs aren't. Excluding the giants like Q, most pterosaurs occupied the same ecological niche as seagulls and passerines (songbirds) - Pteranodon is the most familiar fish-eating flyer to the public, and there's good reason to think small flyers like Anurognathus were insectivorous. Creationists have so far been remarkably quiet as to why this is the case.

**Hydrologic sorting** = The order of fossils deposited by Noah's Flood can be explained like so - Fossils of the same size will be sorted together. Heavier and more streamlined forms will be found at lower levels.

Cherry-picking at best, outright bullshit at worst. Massive creatures like Dunkleosteus are found in the earlier rock strata of the Devonian, but the actual titans of prehistory make their first appearances in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. And the heaviest animal on Earth, Big Blue has never been found in the rock record until long after the dinosaurs died off.

There's also **differential escape**, where smaller and faster creatures are discovered at higher positions in the geological column while bigger, slower beasts would have died and been buried at lower locales. Of course, this explanation implies that leviathans like Patagotitan ran faster than smaller creatures like Allosaurus and Dryosaurus.

&gt;Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds

&gt;This is essentially correct. The fact we cannot do this means that there may NOT be an 'original

Wrong. Mistakes don't build encyclopedias, but they do damage them. Thus the fact that there was at some point an original encyclopedia is not in question.

&gt;I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, if humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

Now, on to YEC timelines, human evolution and the 'original genome'.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us imagine an encyclopedia that is 3 billion characters in length, written only in G, A, T and C.

I give you 7 billion copies, each of which has 25,000 random mistakes which they have acquired by being repeatedly copied *slightly* badly, 250 times.

Can you determine the original text of the encyclopedia with enormous confidence? Yes.

Each encyclopedia is ALREADY 99.999% correct, so that's a fantastic start.

Line them all up and look for the consensus characters at any query sites: job done.

Bonus points, because the mistakes are inherited (copies of copies of copies) you can also sort the encyclopedias into trees of relatedness which allow you to address any ambiguities that might need clarification. Any bottlenecks in the copying process will also jump out incredibly clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

If instead, you cannot do this (and you can't, because it turns out there are WAAAAAAAY more random mistakes than expected), it is telling us something important: as you said, 

&gt;  if you take an encyclopedia and copy it lots of times with mistakes each time and you destroy all the old copies such that we only have the current corrupted copy, it will get to a point where you will not be able to reliably reconstruct the original 

This is essentially correct. The fact we cannot do this means that there may NOT be an 'original' (there may have been several, and they themselves may have been copied from something else), and also, that an *awful lot of time has elapsed* since the earliest encyclopedias were transcribed.

&amp;#x200B;

And this latter scenario is exactly what we see. 

I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, *if* humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

The latter proposal (that humans are 6000 years old and suffered a bottleneck of 8 people 4500 years ago) is incredibly easy to test with the genetic data we have already (and have had for years). And the data absolutely does *not* support this proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

I also would caution against proposing that mutation rates may have changed over time, because your current position requires '100 per generation' to be so high that genetic entropy exists (even if we can't see it). Mutation rates sufficient to establish extant diversity in a mere *4500/6000* years would be huge, and would absolutely be deleterious, and we wouldn't be here.",1579792721

For actual evolutionary biology, this isn't a problem, because evolutionary biology doesn't propose that created, perfect genes exist or ever have existed. For creation it is *very* problematic: your position requires the human species to have been created with one (or perhaps two, depending on clonal creation of eve) genomes, and to have undergone only 100-250 generations, including a massive bottleneck down to 8 people at one stage.

Show support for this. You claim things have been written on this, but thus far I've seen nothing beyond your own self-citations of creationist websites, and the Carter/Sanford paper which doesn't show this at all.

I would need to know 

A) how you determine the 'initial' genotype, and how do you determine whether that represents an optimum

B) how you measure this 'cumulative fitness impact' of neutral mutations, mutations which are (by definition) not ones that impact fitness.

C) how, if this 'cumulative fitness impact' exists and is deleterious, it is not selected against.

D) why we see no sign of this 'cumulative fitness impact' in any wild populations (we can't demonstrate it in the lab, either, unless we use mutator strains, and then it's due to cumulative deleterious mutations rather than neutral ones, which rather defeats the point)

You appear to be viewing your own misunderstandings as a strength, and your lack of formal education as a badge of pride. It...really isn't.

Not sure what you mean with this, and you didn't cite a source for your claim. But it is known that mutations outside the coding region are more likely to be nearly neutral than those inside the coding region (Eyre-Walker &amp; Keightley 2007). And it is also known that higher level multicellular life forms have a much smaller percentage of their genomes dedicated to protein-coding. Voila! Higher percentage of nearly neutral mutations, which means less effective selection.  


&gt; Yep. And the deleterious ones are selected against, the favourable ones are selected for, and the neutral ones allow drift. Voila: equilibrium. 

Wrong. That's not equilibrium, because the 'neutral ones' are only effectively neutral, not strictly neutral. They are in fact very slightly deleterious.

We can now clearly show that hagfish retain all the associated features of vertebrates, and the genetics supports this ancestry too (they have the relevant vertebrae-associated genes, but just don't use them for that) so we have the tools to distinguish clades with secondary loss of traits from more distantly related clades that never had those traits.

t1_ffayrzg,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Sanford and co didn't actually do any other fitness tests, specifically the one you describe. By what metric do you gauge reproductive success, since the method you specifically mention aasnt measured?

Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.   


For another thing, their argument is based upon comparing the death statistics over time (which would correspond to the virulence of the strain). Virulence would correspond to the level of function of the virus--it's ability to replicate itself.  


They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased. That supports the predictions of GE, since it shows that mutations damage function.  


&gt;Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? Why did that phenomenon decrease as mutations in the flu increased?  


&gt; Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.   


No, they did not ignore that. They addressed it in the paper:  


**There have been major medical advances since 1918, and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1-related mortalities. Therefore, the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. However, while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918, such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world. Second, the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve, while medical advances have occurred in bursts (e.g., the breakthrough in antibiotics, and the more recent development of antivirals). Third, each of the great influenza pandemics (1918, 1956, 1968) involved the emergence of a new viral strain, which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe. This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance. Finally, the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1-related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.**   


&gt; if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago? 

I answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/esjgk4/ignorant_virus_headline_fail_virus_is_mutating/ffbv66f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year? 

I don't think you're referring to the same strain they are, which did first surface in the '17 pandemic:  


 **The H1N1 influenza A virus has been circulating in the human population for over 95 years, first manifesting itself in the pandemic of 1917–1918. Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. (From Background section)**  


&gt; does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance? 

Also addressed in the paper:  


**Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain.**",1579784948

This means that all dinosaurs already had avian respiration before some of them gave rise to birds, just like most all theropod dinosaurs already had feathers, and just like velociraptor already had the beginnings of what would become wings. The more recent transitions could fly better, would have their fingers fuse together, would lose their long tail, and would lose their teeth.

t3_ess5i9,DarwinZDF42,"Yes, there are examples. I'll provide one and explain how it works. 

Consider ""tetrapods"". ""Tetrapods"" refers to terrestrial vertebrates - amphibians, reptiles (including birds), and mammals - so named because they, or we, all have four limbs - tetra = 4, pod = leg/foot.

Snakes do not have four limbs. Snakes do not have any limbs. But they are tetrapods. 

How?

Because the groupings are based not on morphology, but on common ancestry. When we classify something as a ""tetrapod"", we're saying ""it shares a tetrapod common ancestor with all other tetrapods"", *not* ""it has four limbs"". 

So we can identify the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all tetrapods, the ancestral tetrapod from which all other tetrapods are descended. Anything descended from that MRCA is a tetrapod, even if it subsequently loses its limbs, as snakes have.

&gt;Where did the ability come from? You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this wasn't.

So you believe.  So you assume.  The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.   Is this proof of speciation?  Common ancestry?  Gene creation?  No.  It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions.  There is no structural changes to the genome.  The bacteria is not 'becoming!' another organism, or transitioning to a cockroach.

It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

You can believe it was 'mutation!', if you wish.  But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria.  Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.  It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

E.coli remaining E.coli is exactly what we'd expect, just as we'd expect eukaryotes to remain eukaryotes, chordates to remain chordates, vertebrates to remain vertebrates, tetrapods to remain tetrapods, mammals to remain mammals, hominids to remain hominids, humans to remain humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are human, and also hominids, mammals, tetrapods, vertebrates, chordates and eukaryotes. And we *always will be.*

Organisms cannot change their ancestry, and this is a cornerstone of descent. ""Cats becoming dogs"" would actually falsify evolution entirely. 

Maybe take notes, because I'm pretty sure you've made this mistake before.

Do we know genes can duplicate? Yes.

Does this allow novel function to be acquired while retaining original function? Yes.

Do we know genes can recombine, bringing domains of different genes together and creating entirely new functions? Yes.

Do we know non-coding sequences can mutate to produce genes of novel function? Yes.

Do we know endosymbiosis can occur? Yes (you can sit down now, Lynn)

t3_esr9ns,OddJackdaw,"&gt; Does mutation 'create' genes?



&gt; No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!' Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.

Of course not. But genes, unlike cars, are passed on when we reproduce, and the offspring of carrier of the mutated gene has a 50% chance of having the mutation, and at that point they *are* new genes. This ain't rocket science.

&gt; I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry

Neither the word ""proof"" nor ""proves"" appears anywhere in that study, so as usual you are strawmanning the studies authors. 

I'm not sure how you could even come to the conclusion that we think it ""proves"" common ancestry. It provides exceptionally strong evidence for natural selection, and it shows that mutations can survive in a gene pool for many, many generations without providing any apparent benefit, both of which provide *evidence* for common ancestry, but it certainly doesn't ""prove common ancestry"".

I suppose it is possible that *someone* got careless and said something close to ""it proves common descent"", but the studies authors did not, and anyone with a decent understanding of epistemology would not make such a claim. It is a flagrant strawman to suggest that the community at large would make anything close to such a sloppy argument. 

&gt; Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  

Pretty sure no one believes that-- at least no one who actually has a clue how evolution works-- so this is yet another strawman. 

&gt; The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen

Sci fi imagines these things, yes, but they literally have *nothing* to do with evolution. They are not real. No one who understand evolution thinks things work like that. 

&gt;An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

Yes. But any mutation that leads to a change that is either not harmful (though not necessarily beneficial) or is not so harmful that it causes the bearer to be unable to reproduce, has a 50% chance of being passed on, in which case it is ""already there"" in the offspring. It might be passed on for millennia by pure happenstance before conditions change, or (as was the case in the Lenski experiment) a second mutation happens, that makes the mutation beneficial and *then* it be selected for.

*That is one of the key things that the Lenski experiment shows:* That mutations that are not fatally detrimental can stick around in the gene pool long enough to eventually become beneficial.  

Your entire argument seems to be based on not just a misunderstanding of the Lenski experiment, but apparently a complete lack of even caring about what it showed. 

&gt; The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.

Your argument might have more credibility if you had the slightest clue what you are talking about. An no, that is not an ad hominem. Your argument betrays that you do not understand the paper you are arguing against *at all.* It is perfectly reasonable and justified to point that out.",1579777193

t1_ffb9ukf,Lockjaw_Puffin,"&gt;there should be at least a complete graduation of at least one species

Why? We already know that fossilization itself is an extremely rare process. We also know that a lot of fossils just do not survive the ravages of time due to exposure, scavengers, excess pressure in the rock the fossil gets buried in and loads of other problems. Even the best-quality [foram fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera#Evolutionary_significance) only go back to the mid-Jurassic. 

&gt;Not at all contrary to what evolution teaches.

Evolutionary theory says nothing about the quality of the fossil record, so this statement is nonsense. 

From your linked article:

&gt;Recent research has shown that Archaeopteryx skeletons had pneumatized vertebrae and pelvis. This indicates the presence of both a cervical and abdominal air sac, i.e. at least two of the five sacs present in modern birds

Neat! Unfortunately for creation.com, Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds, so this information is *completely unnecessary and pointless* in the context of the article. I also note that they didn't mention that bit of info, so bonus points for lying by omission. 

&gt;Ruben noted the problem for the dino-bird theory in general: how would the ‘bellows’-style lungs of reptiles evolve gradually into avian lungs? The hypothetical intermediate stages could not conceivably function properly, meaning the poor animal would be unable to breathe. One of the first stages would be a poor creature with a diaphragmatic hernia (hole in the diaphragm), and natural selection would work against this. 

Basic argument from ignorance. ""We don't know how this could have happened, therefore it couldn't have happened."" Also...

[""When Brocklehurst and his colleagues used CT scans to compare the structure of the lung cavities of 4 modern crocodilians and 29 modern birds with those of 16 dinosaurs from across the dinosaur family tree, they found that all of the dinosaurs had vertebrae more similar in shape to those of birds than those of reptiles. This suggests the dinosaur vertebrae jutted into the lung cavity as they do in birds.""](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2183495-bird-like-lungs-may-have-helped-dinosaurs-rule-the-world/) 

From these, and the fact that you linked an organization that has ""By definition, therefore, no interpretation of facts in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record."" as part of its ""What We Believe"" section, I can tell you have no clue how to vet your sources.",1579776560

\&gt;It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is *not* really a ""random"" process.  Evolution certainly has some ""random"" aspects, notably mutations and  genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of  natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive  landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same  species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated  environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.   This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the  essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability  calculations.

t3_esr9ns,WorkingMouse,"So, I fully expect that most folks here are about to lay into you pretty heavily based on the inaccuracy of your depiction of Prof. Lenski's work, the mechanics of mutation, and at a guess de novo gene formation.

Allow me to take a slightly different tact.

Before the advent of nylon production by humans, nylon and associated chemicals did not exist in the natural environment of earth.  There are, living today, populations of bacteria that can and do digest byproducts of nylon production.  We have samples of the same species of bacteria living in pouted areas that can digest such materials and samples from elsewhere that simply do not posses the ability.

Where did the ability come from?  You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this isn't.  You claimed mutation can't give rise to novel genes.  And yet the original strain discovered possessed three enzymes that were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by related bacteria, and they were not effective on any other material besides man-made nylon byproducts.

So, you tell me: where did these bacteria get a set of enzymes that aren't present in any other members of their species that would not have been at all useful prior to man's nylon production?

And while you're at it, tell me why later work on a bacterial species from an entirely different Phylum of bacteria evolved a similar ability that wasn't present in them beforehand when presented with an appropriate environment for such evolution to occur and in a manner which did not involve the same enzymes witnessed in the first.",1579776210

Let me explain, to be clear. H.sapiens is the name we use to describe a species (us). A definition of species is a group of creatures that can't interbreed.

t1_ff9elf1,azusfan,"&gt;A common example, which you've probably already heard of, is the evolution of E. coli strains able to utilize citrate as an energy resource aerobically, which is the result of modifications to a gene from a duplication event. 

Yes, I've reviewed the Lenski study, and others since. Here's one:

https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene.  It is not a mechanism for trait creation.


&gt;Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population.

..this is believed, or hypothesized.   The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures.   There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt. 

*selection acts upon existing variability*

&gt;Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity.  Diversity *decreases* via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves'  mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry. 

&gt;These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited.

This is believed, only.  There is no evidence for this, just conjecture and plausibility. There is no evidence of any gene or trait being 'created' via mutation.  It is always a deleterious process, and can only be labeled 'neutral!' by decree.

It is like wrecking your car.  It may still be driveable, and maybe the rattle you had before is gone now, but the accident did not create a new car.

I will address mutation further in a new thread, since that subject is of greater interest, it seems.  I will assume we are winding down in this thread.  I hope the posters here find that acceptable,  and do not flood me with accusations of 'Gish Gallop!', and 'starting too many threads!'

Not quite. Deadlyd1001 already answered that and the rest of your questions better than I could, so I'll just leave it at that. 

By the way, the answer to my question was &gt;!whales!&lt; - that's how different creatures can become after diverging from their common ancestor. 

&gt;How has classification not gone absurd, how are there only a handful?

As Sweary_Biochemist has [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eseb2k/show_your_work_for_evolution/ff9uik5/), it already *is* absurd, mainly because evolution never actually stops, but we keep trying to pigeonhole critters into neat little boxes when that's not really appropriate.",1579772113
t1_ffb9ikm,ursisterstoy,"And do this a few more times and the transitions blend together so that when you look from one generation to the next they are always going to be the same species, but there were no Homo sapiens over if you go back far enough with the closest thing you’ll find having the characteristics of Homo rhodesiensis. Go back further and same process. The names of the groups are unimportant because those are a human construct but go back more than a million years and suddenly the animals most like us are currently called Homo erectus. 

Evolution does not **EVER** say anything about one species of animal giving birth to another species of animal. What happens instead is a slow process like a gradient. There is no instance where it stops being Homo rhodesiensis and transforms into Homo sapiens suddenly all at once, but if we were to have ever generation of photos you ask for if we were to compare the organisms living 350,000 years ago to those living 300,000 years ago there would be enough of a noticeable difference that we might decide to call them different things and around 325,000 years ago we might disagree about which group to place those organisms because they fit exactly halfway between both groupings we came up with. The mother born 325,000 years ago and her daughter born some time later like 324,980 years ago will be exactly the same species. They are only ever classified as *different* species when they are clearly different enough to consider them different groups just like we don’t have wild wolves giving birth to poodles though they’re clearly the same species. The amount of change involved doesn’t happen all at once but when we compare the modern versions of each they are clearly different enough from each other that we call one “poodle” and the other “wolf.” 

Something similar happened as one lineage branches off leading to neanderthalensis and the other branches off leading to sapiens. At first they were still extremely similar and we’d still call them heidelbergensis but eventually around 70,000 years ago when they came back in contact with each other they were clearly different enough to classify into different categories even though they were not yet different enough to cut off the ability to produce fertile hybrids like how we can still make a mix of domestic dog and gray wolf. Clearly different enough to call them different things but not different enough to kill the ability to interbreed. If we simply add time and continued genetic isolation we get to something like horses and donkeys or lions and tigers that look even more different and though they can still produce offspring these offspring are infertile so that the lineages never blend back together. Even more time and they can’t produce any offspring at all like cats and dogs, rabbits and mice, humans and gorillas. At the same time, the morphological differences are even more dramatic so that the split is classified above the genus level providing us with carnivores, glires, and apes in each of these cases. This is the family level in linnean classification and genetics along with whatever fossils we happen to find provide us a bit of information about the higher levels of classification as each clade above species is the result of speciation much like explained above with horses and donkeys. Each clade below is generally based on how things look different, with more significant differences at the level of subspecies (like Homo sapiens sapiens compared to Homo sapiens idaltu or Canis lupus lupus compared to Canis lupus familiaris) than there is as the breed or ethnic group. With humans it gets a bit tricky because despite us being able to tell if someone had recent ancestry in one of several continents based, the population is blended to a high degree so that usually any given European might be a mix of German, English, Norwegian, and French all at once. There is so much blending this way all the way back that even what we call German consists of multiple Haplogroups found in other locations as well. With something like dogs it is more clear cut, because dog breeders have more control over keeping a dog a “purebred.”

The smaller more isolated groups tend to have less diversity than the larger ones and for humans the most biodiversity is still contained in Africa, so that everyone else is related to one of the same people around 70,000 years ago that left Africa but we have to go back to around 300,000 years to get to the most recent common ancestor of all of us.

&gt;We can therefore see that we should expect to see an inverse correlation between mortality rates and the virus’ ability to replicate—as the virus reproduces less efficiently, 

Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.

There's also a number of other questions you've never addressed. 

- if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago?

- there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year?

- H1N1 while extinct managed to be last years dominant flu strain... why is that? Why was it extremely common among children born after 2009?

- does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance?",1579747617
t1_ffaheoa,CorporalAnon,"&gt;Viruses that kill their hosts tend to be weaned out very quickly, because dead hosts are terrible at spreading viruses. 

IK that the article claims to address this because deaths from Flu tend to be secondary causes, but that claim misses the point. 

Imagine I'm sick with Virus A, and you're sick with Virus B. Virus A produced a lot of viral copies, the creationist ideal. This, however, send my immune system into a panic and I can't leave my bathroom. 

Virus B has you feeling like crap, but not terribly so. Thus, you can take a drive to CVS. You touch and handle different remedies, which other people touch. You hand cash to another person at checkout. That cash touches other bills and gets handed out as change. On the way home you stop to get gas, and now you've touched the pump. Etc etc. 

It's easy to see that a virus that ""ideally"" produces a ton of copies but makes you so sick you can't leave the toilet is not going to be as transmissible as a virus which is more mild. This is part of why Colds spread so easily; they don't generally stop you from doing things that will transmit it.

t1_ff9gthg,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt;They do not ‘know’ anything, including whether or not they are going to kill their host and stop transmission from continuing. The only objective factor here, when it comes to the virus, is simply how many viruses are being produced, and how quickly. 

Half correct. Viruses do not ""know anything"".

Your objective factors are wrong, though: all that matters is propagation. Churning out billions of progeny viruses at the cost of killing the host can *massively hinder propagation*.

There are many strategies that are of varying degrees of success in different scenarios, and very few of them rely on 'host killing'. Herpex viruses, for instance, will infect and then become latent for years on end (suppressing their own replication), resurging when the immune system is stressed enough to make a resurgence viable, and spreading by direct contact. Then they go latent again.

This works really well, but by the Carter/Sanford criteria, this represents...what, sinusoidal entropy?

Basically, lethality is a terrible metric for viral 'fitness': H1N1 is a zoonotic virus, and like many zoonotic viruses, it behaves oddly in novel hosts. Swine flu and bird flu are endemic in pigs and birds (respectively), and there they are well-tolerated, which is what selection will inevitably favour. Cross the species barrier to humans, and what works in pigs/birds suddenly is non-optimal, and we see a much higher mortality. Over time, this lowers, both as a consequence of herd immunity, medical intervention, and selection for less-lethal behaviour. Viruses that kill their hosts tend to be weaned out very quickly, because dead hosts are terrible at spreading viruses (note that Ebola, while terrifying, generally ends up producing fairly geographically-limited outbreaks, because dead people can't wander around spreading virus).

The ideal adaptive process for a virus is to reach a state where it is both endemic and essentially asymptomatic, unable to be purged from the population and able to spread freely. 

This has, for example, worked incredibly well for the retroviruses that make up a substantial fraction of our genome.",1579735796

The results are not even as complex as a plant or an animal as the cell differentiation is more or less between growing the organism and dying to break off extremities or something else about as simple. It doesn’t come close to showing the development of an internal fluid filled body cavity, nerve cells, organs, or anything like that found in the more complex organisms. 

Somewhat related, but not necessarily going to provide any additional insight into the evolution of a unique trait is how we can grow organs and pieces of organs from stem cells.

t1_ffa40yj,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt; Plus, they have simpler genomes meaning there is a much lower percentage of near neutrals to begin with. Most of their genome is protein-coding, if I'm not mistaken 

Doesn't stop drift: in fact smaller bacterial genomes seem to drift faster than larger genomes. Still not genetic entropy (and typically fitness increases instead). Either way you slice it, this represents a equilibrium scenario (that thing you claim cannot exist): mutations occur, populations drift, fitness typically increases because that's just how life be, and genetic entropy isn't real.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; No, there isn't. Mutations keep happening all the time.  

Yep. And the deleterious ones are selected against, the favourable ones are selected for, and the neutral ones allow drift. Voila: equilibrium.

t1_ff9ez1h,ursisterstoy,"And it’s actually more than a half a million sequential fossils because of heredity and sexual reproduction. There will be some along the way with traits that didn’t get passed on but even among just the ones that did we have to consider the problem of having two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents and so on just in our recent ancestry. Eventually these lineages converge on a smaller number of individuals like about 10,000 **per generation** instead of the continuation of the exponential growth and there’s no way we’d find them all in a timely manner if they happened to be perfectly preserved and most of them aren’t. The actual evidence we do have tells us which populations gave rise to which subsequent populations, especially when considering whole clades all at once and how they changed from the origin of one clade to the origin of the subsequent daughter clade. We may never be able to pinpoint every single individual along the way. For the most ancient ancestry we rely mostly on genetics, but around 540 million years ago some lineages started to leave behind more preserved fossils, and then for the last 2-3 million years we can do a bit better by being able to provide a sequence of which species gave rise to which subsequent species and it isn’t until the last 400-500 years that we can even remotely get anything resembling a family tree consisting of every specific individual along any specific branch along the way to any specific living individual.

Now the same thing still applies to just small steps in our evolutionary progression if the loss of the external tail wasn’t an all at once event and it’s not like we can expect to find the exact organisms that led to us still perfectly preserved so that we could create a slide show of pictures 15 or 20 million slides long for every direct female ancestor of humans. Also this poses another major problem, even if all them happened to be preserved, because we each have two parents that each had two parents which each had two parents and when we account for inbreeding between some of our lineages we do eventually drop back down to about 10,000 individuals pretty consistently all the way back but now we’re talking about more fossils than anyone has any time to post or find for 60 million years of monkeys slowly becoming human including the ape characteristics of losing a tail.

Why is there so much drama over it, then? People act like science is literally dying if others don't agree with their opinion on what is more plausible.

&gt;I think /r/creation was discussing 'redpilling' us with the simulation hypothesis.

That's kind of out of the scope of this sub, but it would be an interesting play. If we're in a simulation, that opens up the possibility of supernatural manipulation from outside of the Sim, and none of it is falsifiable. But that's more of a metaphysics argument than an origins one.

&gt;There's still no reason in reality to accept that humans were originally formed intact from mud and wind in the last ten thousand years as a brute fact: it's just something somebody wrote in a book way too long ago.

Well, humans by our nature trust each other by default. If we're told that it's true, then we have a reason that is sufficient to make it a default unless there is undeniable evidence otherwise. That trust is not a defect, either. There's pretty good science that appears to recognize it as a significant adaptive win and not a side-effect of some other survival strategy.... So if we don't have enough proof to answer the question of origins beyond any doubt, then we're going to keep believing what we've been told by people we trust.

t1_ffa7rnv,ursisterstoy,"It took me a few times of reading to try to process what you’re saying. So basically because of homology (and other things) we know how organisms are related and not something like we assume different groups are related and then we cherry pick out what they share in common and then use what we cherry pick to show they are related? If this is what you’re getting at, it is like Kent Hovind arguing that phylogenetics is just a bunch of us drawing lines on paper because of some similarities we find asking why we don’t say that birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects are all the same group because they fly using wings and why we don’t group organisms together based on how many chromosomes they have or if they have hooves without comparing any other trait. He’s also famous for asking to present what scientists declare to be *closely* related organisms in attempt to debunk phylogeny as evidence of evolutionary relationships when he provided the groups of “elephants” and “pine trees.” Why are they not the same? Because they look different and can’t interbreed. Not only did the lineages leading to both diverge something like 1.8 billion years ago but the actual evidence for how they are related is found within the individual cells - and this is related to homology. Organisms that diverged a very long time ago won’t look anything alike superficially but they’ll still have some structural similarities because of shared ancestry like endosymbiotic mitochondria, cell nucleus, stacked golgi bodies, and so forth. We have many of the same organelles and we have more genes in common with plants than we have in common with bacteria or archaea. 

Of course, he probably provided the answers he provided because he didn’t think we could find any shared homologies and then he made the mistake of saying a god is necessary for the creation of broccoli. These are the types of arguments typically presented by mainstream creationists but they’ve been getting more creative lately and despite their total failure they’ll suggest morphological similarities are evidence of common design and should be caused by the same genes because that how these traits are expressed. That’s really the best they have until you look at the details because everything else falls flat for being completely wrong or self refuting. 

Six mutations in a population causes extinction? No, every human zygote accumulates about 21 times that many. A population of one should die before it is ever born if this was the case. Inbred populations have reduced genetic diversity. Yes, but this is why we know humans aren’t the product of inbreeding 4350 years ago before we even look into evolution. Natural selection doesn’t add diversity. That’s correct, but without variety caused by mutation this mechanism can’t drive a population towards a subset of them - it would likely have no effect at all as a purifying mechanism. Whole clades that arose tens or hundreds of millions of years ago are related. Well yea. How does this help support the alternative? Genetic entropy, devolution, deteriorating genes - none of this happens and if it did and we were created the designer wasn’t very intelligent so that’s another shot against intelligent design. And now we get “homology is circular reasoning” which already fails to support any alternatives except for small superficial changes on top of fundamental similarities because we don’t just look at several superficial similarities- we compare whole genomes, we compare embryonic development, we compare the workings of the cell, we compare all of the things that are the defining characteristics of every clade as they arose over time and to fit within a daughter clade they must first have the defining characteristics of the parent clade or a known mechanism for the loss of one or many of those defining characteristics or fossil transitions showing that their group once had but subsequently lost one or more of those traits. That’s why phylogeny is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the evolutionary history of life on this planet. Morphological and genetic homology plays a big role in determining the placement of these organisms and it only works when nothing ever outgrows its ancestry when it gives rise to diversity and subsequent daughter clades. If suddenly mammals had the same feather as dinosaurs like birds or if salamanders started developing pectoral mammary glands and prehensile tails like monkeys we’d be a bit shocked and when evolution could no longer explain it we’d have to investigate other options. Since this doesn’t happen, creationists can’t demonstrate that it does and they can’t provide a mechanism for what doesn’t happen.

I believe in God and in a will and intent behind how life works and how we are in particular, but to answer one basic part of your question, we can look at lab science, because we've seen single celled organisms change into multicellular organisms (though rather basic) in a lab.

The way it works is pretty simple... When a single celled organism reproduces, it doubles and then splits. The most basic change, the one we've seen in the lab, is a generational shift from doubling and splitting, to doubling and hanging around in a clump. This behavior is determined by genetics in a way that can develop due to selective pressure, like the presence of a predator that eats small things but not big clumps, and then persist in the population even when that predator is removed.

That doesn't say much about how a clonal clump can change into organs and stuff... I expect it's a more significant change, and one that is harder to induce in a lab, but I wouldn't be surprised if science comes up with, or already has, a plausible natural explanation for it.

t1_ff9k920,Sweary_Biochemist,"The category names we give to clades are arbitrary, for convenience. And the more we learn, the less convenient the larger categories actually are. 

It is not, after all, like a single carnivore ancestor suddenly splurged into multiple carnivore descendant lineages all in one go, it's bifurcating lineages all the way, and not all happening at the same time: with one arbitrary carnivore clade (say, feliformes) there will be lineages that diverged more recently, while others that diverged longer ago, and lineages within lineages within lineages, none of which is adequately conveyed by sticking them all in a box and stamping ""feliformes"" on it. And as we learn more we start trying to wedge things into the gaps awkwardly, hence suborder, and then the even uglier infraorder.

A more accurate system is to list all the known divergences in a given species' ancestry, but this can get....very, very long.

And as you note, evolution never actually STOPS, so any given lineage will either die out or diverge into yet more lineages, while the Linnaean taxonomic hierarchy is kinda only appropriate for a static snapshot of lineages and ancestries as they appear NOW, to us. And as noted, it's not even great at that (next up, subinfraorder! Then infrasubinfraorder!)

Basically, the one unit we actually *can* use is ""species"", because it describes what we have *at any given moment*, but it's consequently always moving along with time, and what is a species today may in years to come be the ancestral population from which thousands of new species descend.

Biology is messy, and is under no obligation to conform to the neat categories we like to use. Taxonomic categories are arbitrary and not actually very good at detail, and are also not dynamic. As time passes, if we stick with broad-strokes box-putting exercises, probably 'species' will remain the front runner (with the little tentative feelers of 'subspecies' running just ahead), and we'll keep kingdom/phylum etc and just invent more arbitrary terms to fill in the new subdivisions introduced between 'species' and everything left behind.",1579721660

t1_ff8wu9h,andrewjoslin,"&gt;I have just presented ONE point.. natural selection.. to examine. I submit that the observable phenomenon of selection is a devolving process, not an increasing complexity process. 

No, you introduced multiple other points, in addition to natural selection, by saying these things in your OP:

&gt;Natural selection and breeding, are DEVOLUTION processes.. the organism is becoming LESS diverse, genetically, with fewer traits to pick from, in their lottery pick of genes.   
&gt;  
&gt;Natural selection is evidence AGAINST common ancestry, and does not provide any evidence that it can or did happen.

By asserting that the mechanics of natural are evidence against UCA, you are *forcing* everybody here to bring up mutation, because *the entire theory of evolution, not just selection, is relevant to a discussion of UCA*.  You can't just try to limit the conversation to half of the thing you're discussing.

So let's look at my quotes from your OP:

* Yes, selection is a process by which alleles are culled from a population, and each selection event generally results in a less diverse population.  I don't know what the definition of ""devolution"" is, so perhaps this does fit your definition of that term.
* HOWEVER, even though the above is true, it is NOT true that there is a ""lottery pick"" of genes.  Every generation introduces new mutations into the population, so that the number of alleles in the population (diversity) is generally *increased by mutation* and generally *decreased by selection*.  Over many generations, the diversity of the population will increase if mutation introduces more variation than selection removes -- or diversity will decrease if selection removes more variation than mutation introduces.
* Selection is not evidence against UCA, because everybody knows that selection is not the only process by which evolution occurs.  It is invalid to consider selection separately from all other mechanisms of evolution (and ignore all the other mechanisms), for the purpose of claiming that selection is evidence against UCA.  That's like ignoring the 7 in ""7+1+1=9"" and saying it doesn't add up.  It's like ignoring the engine in a car and saying the car can never get anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And of course, every organism can only draw from the 'lottery pick' of the gene pool they have. I am surprised you dispute this. 

As I have said, mutation generally adds random elements to the genome of every organism.  If you'd like to dispute whether mutation happens, then please provide your evidence.  If you want to save that for another post, that's fine -- just admit that selection alone can't be used as evidence against UCA.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to have a valid discussion of selection OR UCA, you cannot pretend that selection is the only thing which affects the viability of the UCA theory.",1579716472

The main point is that the study in the link shows that H1N!, over time the virus starts to degrade and isn't as good as infecting people as it was many years ago, which is proof of genetic entropy.   So looking at something like that and saying ""genetic entropy has never been induced in a living organism"" is both a willful lie (it has been induced) and not really relevant (the study was about seeing it in nature not inducing it in a lab.",1579713895

Why not instead investigate how easy it is to lose traits like tails? It is unlikely to be as gradual as you demand: generally speaking, you either need a tail or you don't. 

If you need it, you'll keep it, and chance mutations that result in tail truncation will be selected against. 

If you don't need it, you will still keep it until a chance mutation results in tail truncation. With no selective pressure to act against this, there's a fairly good chance this mutation will persist. And now your tail is gone. It could be as abrupt as a few generations.",1579711577

The post in question:

&gt;You're acting as if the statements made by those guys can be trusted. They cannot. Error catastrophe has been witnessed in nature (See Carter &amp; Sanford's H1N1 paper), and it has also been induced (or nearly induced, at least) through mutation accumulation or mutagenesis experiments (for just one example you can look at the Phage T7 experiment mentioned at creation.com/fitness). This is the reason why mutagenesis is used as a treatment for viral infections. If error catastrophe weren't real, then that would be a bogus treatment. Don't listen to their propaganda: error catastrophe is freely recognized by population geneticists. They aren't debating about it being a real thing; that's just the non-expert commentators dishonestly prattling.

First, H1N1 [didn't/isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ead3r/noahs_flood_genetics_not_so_much_xpost_from/dq3u81i/) [experiencing](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfivw6/all_in_one_place_a_detailed_response_to/f35pi9q/) [""genetic entropy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ajkw3w/so_just_a_final_update_on_carter_sanfords_h1n1/).

And finally, yes, mutagenic treatments exist for viruses (well, one does: a drug called ribavirin), but there are two problems with PDP's statement. First is that, even if it works exclusively via mutagenesis, it causes *lethal mutagenesis*, which is a broader phenomenon than *error catastrophe*. Lethal mutagenesis is just so many mutations the target dies. Can be all at once, or building up over time. Lethal mutagenesis is *specifically* referring to accumulation over time. To the extent we can tell, ribavirin acts via the former, but not the latter. But second, it's not even clear ribavirin works via lethal mutagenesis. [It has a bunch of other effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483), and the degree to which one or some combination of these are responsible for the observed effects has not been determined.

t1_ff8tsja,EyeProtectionIsSexy,"&gt;1. Increasing complexity, and levels of diversity.

By increasing complexity, would we be talking about the development of new genes for new cellular processes such as growth characteristics, metabolism, cellular components? 

What would we be able to measure to show this? I'm not trying to be annoying or funny when asking the same question, I just want to make sure I address your question correctly. IF we expect an increase in complexity, we expect to find ""_____"". What would that look like to you on the molecular level? 

Just to be clear, when I say molecular level, let's focus on the monomer level of cellular components, such as amino acids, fatty acids, nucleotide, and any modifications that can happen therein, such as individual sugar attachment, hydroxyl, ethyl or methyl groups. I think focusing at that level of cellular organization will help us better deduce what emergent properties occur as a result. 



&gt;2. New traits, that were not already present in the parent stock.

I'm going to answer this, but I have a few questions as well. 

Could you explain to me in your own words how this is different than an increase in complexity? Is this a specific type of an increase in complexity? 

A common example, which you've probably already heard of, is the evolution of E. coli strains able to utilize citrate as an energy resource aerobically, which is the result of modifications to a gene from a duplication event. This is a new trait that was not present in any other strain ever identified up until that point. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) is some information on the original experiment. They went through about 50,000 generations (probably should give a few thousand), with the mutation occurring ~30,000. This may seem like a lot of generations, however the pressures weren't the strongest. [Other studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800869/) have achieved similar, but different, duplication and point mutation events leading to the same utilization with cultures exposed under conditions designed to produce this at a quicker rate, such as 12 generations. Here we have novel characteristics never seen prior to 2008 in any wilt type population.


&gt;3. Selection pressures causing diversity, and increases in complexity, as the organism adapts to changing conditions.

This is what Darwin observed on the island. Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population. This can be tracked by measuring changes that occurred within the genome. 

If I can ask a question in response to this: Let's temporarily agree that humans evolved from apes. What increase in complexity and novel genes occurred as a result, and what molecular-level changes occurred to allow this to happen?

&gt;4. Infrequent 'low levels of diversity', as a mechanism for increasing complexity and new traits would add, not diminish, traits needed for survival.

I'm honestly confused, would you mind rephrasing this? I'm not sure what you're saying, sorry.

&gt;5. Observable, repeatable, definable mechanism(s) for increasing complexity.

We can refer back to question 2 about this. That experiment has been repeated a couple times, with citrate usage occurring after environmental pressure, with populations incurring separate mutation events to accomplish the same goal energy resource utilization. 

We know genes are inherited, passed down from parent to offspring (with few exceptions, such as horizontal gene transfer). Mutations occur because cellular replication is not perfect (duplication's, inversions, deletions, etc....), and environmental pressures such as UV radiation and cyclic oxygen compounds can alter individual nucleotide. Sometimes tautermerization temporarily alters a nucleotide structure, where a polymerase reads it wrong and produces the wrong copy. Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

If mutations occur and are inherited, this is how evolution occurs. Just like how we can measure the changes in E. coli over time, we can measure the changes that acquired between humans and chimps. We know exactly what mutations occurred, the genomes of both species has been sequenced thousands of times. These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited. We can go into some bioinformatic analysis if you'd like and play around with some numbers. We can analyze the genome of these species together, if you have the time.",1579711340

Yes there is mtDNA in-clade ancestry for every clade containing mitochondria but, even better, whole genome comparison takes us much much further than that and by including more genes provided a better more clear picture of their evolutionary relationships that just comparing about sixteen genes on their bacterial symbionts ever could. Devolution isn’t a thing. There is no end goal. Losses and gains of features are the same process working in all directions at the same time such as viruses that lost their more complex features necessary for being considered alive and how humans have gained a lot more complexity than their distant ancestor that they share with these viruses. Same process operating in different directions because there isn’t anybody guiding it along and in both cases an increased survival benefit despite completely different outcomes.

To get felines that are different from each other from a common ancestor or canids you start with a single breeding population, which has natural variation due to mutation, and you split them up so that cheetahs don’t breed with bobcats and neither of them breed with house cats and then among the house cats you get further variation due to mutation selected for by humans to get shaggy haired cats, bald cats, and cats with short hair. For dogs the same process in nature creates wolves, wild dogs, and coyotes and then wolves - just two or three varieties, are turned into several hundred breeds because of purification and hybridization to get poodles, greyhounds, Dalmatians, Great Danes, Rottweilers and German shepherds among others.

The field of molecular evolution uses principles of [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) and [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics) to explain patterns in these changes. Major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes, neutral evolution vs. [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), origins of new genes, the genetic nature of [complex traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_traits), the genetic basis of [speciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation), evolution of development, and ways that evolutionary forces influence [genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) and [phenotypic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) changes.",1579702432

t3_es5qk3,Capercaillie,"""Homology is a circular argument"" is ridiculous.  Homology is a beautiful example of scientific prediction and hypothesis testing.  Let's suppose you go into a room and there are three people there.  Two of them have brown eyes, dark skin, and dark hair, and the third has blond hair, light skin and blue eyes.  If asked to predict which two are related, one would most likely guess the two that resemble each other.  *Now* you do a DNA test, and whaddya know, the two similar-looking folks have very similar DNA.  What you have is a lovely theory about common descent being indicated by resemblance, supported by separate evidence.  Now you find out that the two darker-skinned people live in the same town, speak the same language, and suffer from the same parasite infestation, while the other fellow lives elsewhere, speaks a different language, and has a different, though somewhat related, parasite.

If homology is forced to stand on its own, you might get away with making an argument that it's evidence of common design (but wait, isn't that a ""circular argument?""  You've said that similarity in structure is evidence of common design, but didn't you define common design as that which causes similarity in structure?).  But if you want to claim common design, you need to explain why your designer puts a tailbone in humans, and a pelvis on a whale, and a femur in a boa constrictor.

As the tips of each phylogenetic tree is reached, LOWER DIVERSITY is observed, to the point of extinction. 

Continued sniping about me, personally,  does not strengthen your position, nor evidence your argument. 

&gt;All of these originally originated from something resembling a shrew

..this is an unevidenced belief.  There is no evidence, such as the 'mtDNA in-clade ancestry', for the belief in these ascensions.  There is only plausibility,  suggestion, and vague, 'looks like!' conjecture.  Natural Selection has no evidence of increasing complexity,  or common ancestry.

I have just presented ONE point..  natural selection.. to examine.  I submit that the observable phenomenon of selection is a devolving process, not an increasing complexity process.

t1_ff8bc6s,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly?

That's a very big point to gloss over. The fact that it is only being 'considered' neutral, rather than actually being neutral, is a very big deal. Those mutations are not going to be weeded out by natural selection because they are too small. They are ""flying under the radar"". They also just so happen to amount to the majority of all mutations in general. Most mutations are very small in this way. So that means most mutations are outside the scope of NS to remove or weed out. And lastly most mutations are damaging. You add all this together and what you get is inevitable decline, which is the exact opposite of evolution. That's why this is important.  


&gt;Even if weakly deleterious mutations are fixed, it can open a new evolutionary pathway for a more optimal genotype that may have otherwise not been possible. 

Yeah, it's an ""evolutionary pathway"" alright: a pathway to extinction.",1579698243

t1_ff696tx,azusfan,"&gt;Look at the haplogroups I linked, there is no way to fit those into a single starting originator ancestor without mutations.

I don't follow the reasoning.  Mutations have been followed in organisms from the mt-MRCA. ..the first traceable organism in each haplotype.  The parent canid produced all the variety we see today, and probably more, that has not come up in the 'lottery pick' of gene selection. They had a mutation rate, that has been measured, and can be followed in subsequent generation (for those mutations that are passed on).

There is no conflict with the phylogenetic trees in each haplotype.  Humans spread across the planet, carring their inherited genes to lower diversity 'tips' in the human tree.  They settled in homogeneous isolation, with unique morphological traits defining them.  They could still interbreed with other humans.. they only had cosmetic, or slight morphological differences..  not enough to isolate reproductively. 

Their mutations could be followed, and a rate calculated.  Environmental pressures 'selected' the trats most beneficial for survival, though humans showed ingenuity in overcoming deficiencies in their physical traits.

Eskimos,  for example,  have little body hair.  Thick fur would seem like a 'good thing' for their adaptation. They did not freeze while waiting for evolution to provide them with this, but covered themselves with animal skins and fur, to compensate for their lack.

Some Sicilians,  otoh, are very hairy, even though they live in a warmer climate where a fur coat would not be essential to survival. 

Humans have the unique ability to adapt with ingenuity,  and are not dependent on the time and chance of evolving traits to adapt.  Natural selection is not as important of a 'selective' process, among humans,  because they have other means to survive in changing conditions.   

But most other organisms are completely dependent on their EXISTING genes, to draw from, to adapt. Natural Selection can only draw from existing variability..  it is not a 'creative' process.",1579697711

After this thread has expired from exhaustion,  i will be happy to examine the claim of mutation as the mechanism for increasing complexity. 

..and your continued obsession with my person is just a deflection..

Natural Selection.  Does it support and fit into the model of common ancestry and increasing complexity,  or does it support anf fit into the model of intelligent design? 

I see the physical evidence, and the observable phenomenon of DECREASING DIVERSITY, as evidence of creation, not common ancestry. 

There is nothing in SELECTIVE pressures that exhibits increasing complexity..  the opposite occurs.  There is no evidence that natural selection (or man directed breeding) has any ability or mechanism for increasing complexity or common ancestry.  It does the EXACT OPPOSITE.  It DECREASES  diversity, and 'devolves' the organism to lower levels of diversity. 

That is the singular point here.  Examining other alleged mechanisms for common ancestry can come later, but will fare no better, i predict.",1579694437

We have clear fossil evidence that some groups of dinosaurs gradually produced dinosaurs that over time became more and more bird-like.  Developing feathers, wings, beaks.  Over time these dinosaurs became so different than their dinosaur ancestors that we looked far more like modern birds than ancient dinosaurs so we started calling them bird fossils. 

Evolution works like language.  English speaking parents give birth to English speaking kids.  But look at the romance languages.  In the Roman empire, people spoke Latin.  These people spread through Europe to modern France and Spain.  Over time these groups became more isolated, and their language began to change separately.  Different areas came up with different slang, idioms, and slightly altered word meanings or connotations as well as gradually altering pronunciation of their words.  But a Latin speaking mother still gave birth to a Latin Speaking kid. 

So how did Spain get to the point that they have a different language altogether than Latin as well as French and Italian?  The population gradually changed over time to the point where us looking back say that the result is enough different than the origin to say they're a different thing.

For example, if someone’s IQ decreases by 1, then natural selection will have no problem with that. However, once the mutation that reduced their intelligence spreads throughout the population, then most people will have a reduction in IQ. These mutations keep accumulating, and once natural selection *does* have a problem with it (because the IQ is low enough), it will not be able to wipe out single individuals, because the entire population has those mutations.

t1_ff7t1rn,Sweary_Biochemist,"Some introns do things. Some introns can even be self-splicing (though these are rare). Some contain enhancers, either encouraging transcription or influencing behaviour of up and downstream genetic elements.

Mostly, though, these enhancer sequences are short, and fairly relaxed, in the way of most non-coding sequence. All an intron really needs is GT at one end, AG at the other. And even those rules get bent frequently.

Most intronic sequence is indeed basically useless (and accumulates mutations far, far more rapidly than coding sequence). There are many mammalian transgenes that are used both for research and therapeutically that are simply extant genes with the massive bulk of their introns stripped out (usually because we have to do so: dystrophin, for example, is 2.4 million bases long, but with introns removed, only 14000: 99.5% of it is just...intron). 

They work just fine, with the interesting facet that a gene carrying even a SINGLE intron will be expressed more readily than one with no introns, even if that intron is just filler sequence. The very act of recruiting a spliceosome seems to bolster transcript stability.

t3_es5qk3,ursisterstoy,"It is the articles like the one provided that young Earth creationists turn to when they say “the science is overwhelmingly in favor of young Earth creationism” but of course this would be wrong. Not only are these religious propaganda pieces wrong on nearly every point but even when they’re right it shows their ignorance of science. Dogs only produce more dogs. This is true, but that’s exactly how evolution works when *populations* divide and accumulate changes separately resulting in two or more subgroups. All of those breeds of domesticated dog are clearly different from each other so that we can classify them into different groups like “chihuahua” or “Great Dane” or “golden retriever.” They also share some striking similarities too, so not only do we know they are all the same “kind” of animal because of human involvement in selective breeding but we can look to their known evolutionary progression in recorded history, in their genetics, and in their morphology- especially shared homology. We know domesticated dogs are a subspecies of wolf. We know that wild dogs, coyotes, and foxes are all part of the same group despite wolves, domestic dogs, and coyotes being inter-fertile to varying degrees and wild dogs being too different genetically to breed with domesticated gods despite looking almost the same. The same thing applies to horses, zebras, and donkeys but to a smaller degree because these animals can make hybrids that are sterile despite looking like the same kind of animal. 

The same process that we use to develop dog breeds is the same process that natural selection uses to develop subspecies. Subspecies that don’t interbreed might result in different species that can still produce sterile offspring for awhile or they may form a ring species but eventually as the differences continue to pile up on top of the fundamental similarities they fully diverge into different populations no longer able to inter-breed at all. Then, they are no longer bound to wind up blending back together like could happen if we made a hybrid of all known dog breeds, for example, and selected for that while killing off everything that wasn’t a mix of at least two previous breeds along the way. Selective breeding creates divergent populations faster than natural selection normally does because we can control for the desired traits while in nature they (the animals) tend to select for something resembling their own group even in populations that actively breed in a way that results in the most diversity in that population. Like how humans tend to avoid close relatives, the same applies in the wild with other groups. While we don’t typically try to breed with non-humans (and not that it would produce any offspring anymore anyway) we do have this tendency to blend the traits of the entire local population together so that local populations can be told apart from foreign ones until the advent of high speed travel, anyway. 

The whole idea of different kinds of life created separately isn’t consistent among the groups pushing the idea nor is it consistent with the scientific data. The  Earth is more like 4.6 billion years old and not less than 10,000 years. There are cities older than they think the entire universe was and whole civilizations that don’t mention the flood that never happened as they also apparently lack any knowledge of Yahweh as they are building monuments to pagan gods during the time that the flood waters were supposedly pouring in with their own documents about different floods in different locations at different times for different reasons with different fluids involved. The ones most similar to the biblical account are from a region where several stories about it include a whole pantheon of gods - the one who created people being the one who warns the Utnapishtim, the Atrahasis, or the Xiusudra while the rest send the flood waters. Obviously it wasn’t global, but archeological evidence does support a localized flood. The creation story in the Bible and altered a bit for the Quran is also a lot like a collection of several stories from that region combined into the two different versions in the first two chapters in Genesis that they like to assume are part of the same event. 

When we are comparing science to the biblical version of creation there’s already a clear winner here so they like to mask it as intelligent design instead allowing for different creation stories in some cases. And we’re supposed to believe they have science on their side? I think not.",1579686314

Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly? Realistically as far as I can tell, the practical application of neutral theory is to provide a null hypothesis for testing selection vs genetic drift. How does it support genetic entropy? These mutations may change some aspect of the genome, but that doesn’t support a slow degradation over time that will not be stopped.

There is no reason to see diversity as anything but a need to diversify. its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive. 

Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity  to others.

t1_ff7yxb7,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; Not trying to hijack this thread, but I really don’t understand the point you’re trying to make. Neutral mutations are, by definition and nomenclature, neutral. Neutral meaning they do not raise fitness nor do they lower fitness.

You are not correct. Kimura's 1979 paper (which I've quoted many times now) explains neutral theory in depth. All mutations are assumed to have a fitness effect, but it's a spectrum and at a certain point the fitness effect becomes too weak to overcome the effect of randomness that overrides it.

To quote modern population genetics:

&gt;The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely
that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it
has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some
effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However,
there is a class of mutations that we can term effectively
neutral. These are mutations for which Nes is much less
than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random
genetic drift.

doi.org/10.1038/nrg2146.

So there are two different categories of neutral mutations: strictly neutral  (no fitness effect at all) and effectively neutral. Neutral theory says that all neutral mutations are really of the 'effectively neutral' class, and there are no 'strictly neutral' mutations because all genetic changes have some effect, even if it's only very tiny.",1579663116

These neutral variants will become either fixed or lost as per genetic drift.

t1_ff7s72e,DefenestrateFriends,"&gt;How they propagate in a population is exactly what I am talking about.

It's not though. Your first premise of GE is:  
1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations 

Which I just showed is false.  


The third premise of GE is:   
3)  The vast majority of mutations are damaging 

Which I also just showed is false.   


Both of these premises say nothing about how ""alleles propagate in a population."" They make functional claims about the nature of mutations. The fourth premise of GE is the only premise which addresses selection coefficients in a population:   


4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

You badly lost that argument. It's okay. There is absolutely no shame in that. Science rewards being wrong because that's how we arrive at better answers. If you want to claim that the majority of mutations that are fixed in a population are, in fact, deleterious, that's even more of an uphill battle and is easily shown to be false via sequencing data. 

  


&gt;I want you to speak in terms that 1979 Kimura would understand. 1991  Kimura tried to throw Ohta under the bus for some reason, but the field  of population genetics has not gone along with him. 

Again, I invite you to perform the analysis using your own method. Just let me know what you're doing and why. There is no bus, Kimura was using the best available data and he was skeptical about some of Ohta's claims which are clearly laid out in his 1991 paper that we've already discussed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Namely, you have only two categories to pick from: strictly neutral and effectively neutral. 

I don't, because that's not how the data and the real world work. We operate with evidence, not semantic definitions or misunderstandings from the late 60's and 70's.   


&gt;But Kimura in 1979 made no provision at all for 'strictly neutral' mutations. 

So what? 1991 Kimura did. End of story. It doesn't even matter what you call it. The mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism. If you are claiming that they do, then you must show evidence for it. It cannot simply be asserted or quoted.   


&gt; And Eyre-Walker and Keightly similarly make no bones about the fact that all mutations have fitness effects. 

Brother, it doesn't matter what they said or how you are reading it. It only matters that the claim is supported by evidence or not. Keightly is clear:   


“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95%  and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively  neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50%  of mutations are deleterious.**”

  
30% of mutations in coding regions are neutral. 95% to 50% of non-coding are neutral. 1% of the human genome is coding, the other 99% is non-coding. You can do the math there. The vast majority of mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism in any detectable manner. If it's not detectable, you cannot claim that they are deleterious. If you do claim they are deleterious, you need to show the data. Otherwise it's an untested assertion.   


&gt; 58 mutations is a laughably small sample size

Then, using 10 different tools to measure the integrity of the rivet with all of them giving the same independent ""no defect"" consensus and then cross-checking the rivet against several large data bases with known rivet defects and finding that your single rivet doesn't have any of those defects either, you say, ""I think it's good given the available data.""

&amp;nbsp;

This idea has problems, but only one of them really matters:

It's entirely self-defeating because it implicitly acknowledges that these regions don't have a function *at present*. That's conceded off the top, and then the argument is ""but they are built to acquire a function in the future"". Okay, and? They're *not functional right now*. So that's the ballgame, as far as I'm concerned. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, the purported mechanism through which these ""VIGEs"" would work to generate more variation? Those would be evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation, recombination, and neofunctionalization. So...yes? Is that the argument creationists want to go with?

&amp;nbsp;

Third, creationist might argue ""well, having the variation is inherently functional"", even if it doesn't do anything *yet*. Which, fine, but there are two knock-on problems from there. First, we know what that looks like. There are species (often microbial parasites) that are adapted to maintain a higher-than-expected level of variation, and we know what the hallmarks are - suppression of DNA repair mechanisms and frequent intra-genomic recombination, to name two hallmarks. And we don't see that universally.

Second, selection isn't forward-looking. It can't preserve stuff that isn't doing something *now*. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally (and related to the last point above), if these regions were ""designed"" for a purpose, then they'd be sequence-constrained, i.e. there'd be selection against mutation accumulation in these regions, to preserve the ""designed"" function. But they do accumulate mutations in the manner we'd expect if they were unconstrained. Meaning there just isn't a function there.

/u/nomenmeum is citing [the ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE): for the laymen, ENCODE was a genetic survey of the human genome, using the broadest possible definition of functional, in order to identify previously unknown areas of activity. And, naturally, they found activity:

&gt;The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical RNA and/or chromatin associated event in at least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event: 95% of the genome lies within 8kb of a DNA-protein interaction (as assayed by bound ChIP-seq motifs or DNaseI footprints), and 99% is within 1.7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE.

The problem is that 'one biochemical event' is a very broad term. It doesn't actually imply function: we have broken genes, such as our vitamin C synthesis gene, that are still involved in such an event, and they don't do anything anymore.

Secondly, given they used the broadest possible definition, we *know* that 20% of the genome has *absolutely no function*. That number can't go down any further.

&gt;Selection coefficients are what population genetics models are all about! 

It's a small component of a huge field that rarely anyone is concerned with, especially in the case of disease/pathogenecity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; When you say ""functional definitions at the molecular level"", you're  going outside of population genetics altogether and you're putting out a  massive red herring that has nothing to do with what we're talking  about here.  

I'm not, and these kinds of studies comprise huge proportions of the field. Feel free to check out GWAS. 

  


&gt;None of what we've been quoting from Kimura, Ohta, Eyre-Walker,  Keightley, etc. has had anything to do with ""functional definitions at a  molecular level."" 

YES, that's correct for the most part. You have been quoting operational definitions and claiming that they confer functional relevance when they don't. That's the problem we are having. It doesn't really matter what semantic definition you decide to land on, you just need to show how you determine if a mutation is good, bad, or neutral. That's it.   


&gt;Kimura conveniently neglected to mention this was also HIS model, which he presented in 1979. 

Nearly Neutral Theory is an extension of his model which predicts that some weakly deleterious mutations can reach fixation in small populations when genetic drift is a more powerful driving force than natural selection. When the population is large enough, natural selection becomes the greater driving force again and the allele is removed from the population. This is not synonymous with claiming that, ""the majority of mutations are deleterious"" as you want to do. This is something that you can actually test right now. As before, show the data, not the misquote.    


&gt; In Kimura's own model from '79, which he is here trying to pretend  didn't happen for some reason, these 'very slightly deleterious  mutations' (effectively neutral) were a huge proportion of the overall  total. 

Kimura isn't pretending anything. You just haven't the slightest idea what it predicts or why and so you keep playing a semantic language game with yourself. I don't care what you decide to call a mutation, just show the data.   


&gt; Something else must be going on, but he's not being forthright as to his reasons for changing his story. 

Right. Clearly it's a huge conspiracy to deceive you. It would be totally unreasonable to suggest that you never understand neutral theory to begin with and now it's slowly started to sink in.   


&gt;Certainly modern scientists still view these effectively neutral  mutations as being prevalent, and the fact that they would be is so  obvious as to be beyond question.

For a more dramatic example mice are about 90% the same when we account for the genes shared by both us and them but the other differences (that matter less for survival) climb all the way to 50%. We also should be careful to not take a linear approach with the differences denoted here because 6 million years for a 1% difference and 65 million years for a 10% difference doesn’t match up on a straight line steady rate of change when we consider yeast and certain plant species that are still around 30% identical to us when considering just the shared genes but they diverged from us over a billion years ago.

Several trillion generations of organisms in the direct ancestor-descendant lineage from “the first living organism” (whatever that entails) to the time period we would give for the origin of of our species.

I worded it that way, because it is important to know that there are two basic laws that deal with evolution. They are called the law of biodiversity and the law of monophyly. Nothing transforms into something else fundamentally different than how it started (especially not in a single generation) but every organism ever born or produced by the reproductive practices of single celled organisms contains mutations so that *automatically* when accounting for these mutations and heredity the allele frequency of the population changes (something learned about when studying heredity in high school). All that this means is that there may be a different variants of the same gene in the same population but it may vary between 0% and 100% of the population containing any particular variant and with each new death or birth this percentage changes - diversity increases with more individuals.

With those two laws in mind and all of the facts like the number of mutations that occur, the sequence of how everything in buried underground, the genetic evidence and so forth we can reconstruct our phylogeny to give us a good picture of the process. 


https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMLnubJLPuw0dzD0AvAHAotW 

This playlist goes over the broad details. Obviously a lot more than I could explain in a single text response. 

There are also other things I could share regarding paleontology, genetics, and experimental data such as when several different single celled organism evolved multicellularity and basic cell differentiation (very basic) in a lab setting because many single celled organisms have the genes needed to move to multicellularity already and some of them regularly form colonies and it just takes the same thing but a more dedicated form to get to the major clades in the video series. I also talked to the creator of this video series recently so that if you do happen to watch it in your free time, and you get to episode 46 before episode 47 is released, he informed me that he decided to split up episode 47 into four different videos because of the vast amount of information just from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens (which is obviously towards the end of explaining how single celled organisms have rise to humans)

A more simple explanation, but without all the necessary details to fully explain the process, is that evolution is population based and those allele frequency changes I mentioned earlier because of mutation, heredity, and selection pressures (as well as other things like genetic drift) provides the increasing biodiversity *within* a breeding population like humans with different color skin, different color eyes, hair color, height, connected or disconnected ear lobes. Obviously, most of these changes don’t really provide much benefit or disability when it comes to survival and reproduction and often times a beneficial one won’t be very dramatic all at once though we have several examples of those too. The detrimental ones do slip in, but generally those tend to result in a shorter lifespan or infertility and some like sickle cell anemia also provide a benefit alongside the detrimental effect. Some like that and diabetes won’t stop new organisms from being born so they spread just like all the beneficial ones. What really matters is the general trend in a local population to acquire some trait (good or bad - with many “bad” ones resulting in death and infertility and not getting passed on). All that needs to happen from there is some reason for the population to split up into different smaller breeding populations more isolated from the whole group. At first the biggest difference might be nothing more than what we see across the entire population of living humans or they can be as dramatic as the difference between broccoli and kale. If the very same processes continue over time (everything related to evolution of a single population plus the genetic isolation between two sub-populations) the differences between these groups pile up. At first, when considering single celled organisms, many of the most noticeable differences have to deal with the working of the cell like the type of cell membrane, the type of protein used for synthesizing ATP, and sometimes, especially in our case, the acquisition of endosymbiotic bacteria that later become organelles. At this stage of evolution there is also a lot of horizontal gene transfer so that different species have a mechanism for sharing genetics making it a bit more difficult to work out the phylogenetic relationships (the parent-daughter relationships). After this results in eukaryotes and eukaryotes branch into many different sub-groups multicellularity occurred at least a handful of times within plants, what would become animals, fungi, slime molds and so forth. At this stage the effects of horizontal gene transfer have less effect and before this time sexual reproduction starts to play a bigger role (along with heredity and sexual selection). Several small changes and the same process continues to drive biodiversity but as time goes on certain populations acquire certain defining characteristics across the board and the rest of the group does off. Without dragging this on all day this results in the rest of the changes resulting in an internal body cavity filled with organs, bilateral symmetry and a brain, cartilage and bone, nerves, muscles, eyes and all of the other complex characteristics found in humans and whole groups of animals related to us. Some fish eventually took to the land and developed the trait of having four limbs (legs, arms, wings, whatever but always four or less as sometimes a loss of limbs defines a group). They get better at living on land, they develop mammal characteristics, they develop to living in trees, they start walking on the ground and using tools and they gradually become human. All the while the branching tree of life is continuing on so that side branches (like distant cousins) split off to eventually give way to other living things and several extinct ones. The entire time nothing is ever fundamentally different from the generation before or after it, but as a population eventually becomes more isolated and the in between forms die off we get those defining characteristics for every taxonomic clade with several found that seem to fit into two of them at the same time showing a clear transition from one to the other (just in case they were pictured as sister groups and not parent and daughter groups). This long paragraph is still just a very basic summary of how evolution gives rise to all of the biodiversity around us though some are quick to point out hybrids and nearly extinct populations showing little diversity which both happen as well and are completely consistent with evolution when you know all the details just like converging on the same traits *after* diverging into separate breeding populations because both groups still happen to live in a similar environment or are able to exploit a similar niche in a different one isn’t in any way contradictory to evolution.",1579647079

Eohippus is generally considered to be the first equid -- its feet had pads (and small hooves in place of claws), and the Wiki page describes a number of other ways it's different from modern horses.

Would you consider that a true horse?  If not, where in that lineage do the true horses appear?

Of course, anything in Eohippus' clade will always and forever be a member of all the clades Eohippus itself belonged to.  So the thing you want to see, ""evidence of one animal becoming another animal"" is neither expected by the theory of evolution, nor has it ever been observed.

t1_ff6zeaw,andrewjoslin,"You should really look into cladistics:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) 

The fundamental principle is that no organism ever stops being what its ancestors were.  This means that humans are still apes, which are still monkeys, which are still primates, which are still mammals, etc.  So no, there's never been a case where an organism's offspring is something that is not in the same clade as the parent.  That's the whole point:  no organism will ever cease to be an ancestor to its descendants, and no organism will ever cease to be a descendant of its ancestors -- nothing in genetics would make sense any other way.  Even if some future organism goes on to form its own clade, it is still a member of all the same clades that its ancestors were.

What we *do* observe, repeatably in every life sciences field, is that offspring are generally *slightly different* than their parent(s).  The offspring of an aphid is still an aphid, and it's still all the things its parents were -- but it's not the same as either of its parents.  Nor are you and I exactly the same as our parents.  This is due to mutation, as well as sexual reproduction -- but it still happens in asexual organisms like bacteria, etc. (including aphids, which can reproduce parthenogenetically).

These changes add up over huge amounts of time (read:  many MANY generations), so that after all that time the organisms may (or may not) be a different species from their ancestors.  Modern dogs are descended from gray wolves -- and they are still gray wolves.  Modern humans and chimps are descended from some common ancestor in the clade Hominine -- and both humans and chimps are still Hominines.

Neither the theory of evolution nor the definition of speciation *ever* require a wolf to give birth to a non-wolf, or a horse to a non-horse, etc.",1579643878

t3_es11qk,Dzugavili,"&gt;If most small, deleterious mutations cannot be selected against, and build up in the genome, what real-world, tested mechanism can evolution call upon to stop mutational meltdown?

If they are deleterious, they can be selected against -- maybe not within one generation, but within enough degradations, it will have a selectable gap to the 'original' variants in the population. Statistically, because the genome is large enough compared to the mutation rate such that most genes will not change, even across large swaths of time, it is unlikely for an unselectable gene to fix at all and thus degrade the collective genome: the original variants are likely to still exist in the population, and they become the selected variant after enough degradation occurs.

Second, we're not sure what this would look like. It's not clear if genes can be rated so linearly such that such a point actually exists. It's also unclear whether or not unselectable beneficials -- or the mutations reversing this entropy -- eventually become dominant or bring this to an equilibrium above extinction.

Otherwise, we expect that beneficial variants will arise at a greater pace than neutral degradation could occur. Even if they are only minorly better, they will overcome neutral or extinction.

&gt;What do you have to say about Sanford’s testing on the H1N1 virus, which he claims proves genetic entropy?

He relabeled the axis for 'mortality' as 'fitness'. There are many reasons to believe that these aren't the same thing, as viruses attenuate to their hosts: they don't want to kill the host, they want to use them to spread. Mortality is not fitness, particularly as ultra-mortality, or what Sanford would argue is 'peak fitness', results in rapid extinction.

Furthermore, given we were combating an breakout, those numbers are going to be biased by our response. Mortality would drop off as the epidemic ends, and this has nothing to do with the fitness of the virus itself, but the lack of new hosts.

&gt;What about his claim that most population geneticists believe the human genome is degrading by as much as 1 percent per generation?

I don't believe these claims are backed with any serious effort. I highly doubt 'most' accept 1% as degradation, if they see any degradation at all. I have yet to see any efforts made to cite this claim.

&gt;If genetic entropy was proven, would this create an unsolvable problem for common ancestry and large-scale evolution?

No/maybe. This largely depends on where it is proven and the actual mechanisms.

Humans have recreated the world into a strange place, biologically speaking, and we have largely uncoupled the systems that have brought us here. We might be causing genetic entropy in other species through hyper-predation; we might be suffering genetic entropy because we live in a largely post-selection society. However, if this isn't innate to the algorithm, then nothing is wrong with our deep time analysis. Since it doesn't appear to operate in viruses or bacteria, we seem to be okay.

Otherwise, it may only predict the lifetime of one species. It doesn't account for speciation.",1579642617

t1_ff70b9z,youbetheshadow,"The ""kinds"" thing is sort of a false category to use post-hoc. Yes, we can say that there are different ""kinds"" of organisms; for example, some animals can't reproduce with other animals of different species. (This positively is not true for all animals, let alone all organisms, but it's a simple categorical framework we can use.)

So, fine. Cats and dogs are different ""kinds,"" but they themselves are large categories: wolves, cheetahs, ocelots, domesticated dogs, housecats, etc. So are cats and fish. Fish includes a phylogenetic lineage that comprises all mammals, all reptiles (and birds), etc. 

We can then ask: how are cats and dogs similar? Well, they both have fur, they both give birth to live young, they both have mammary glands, etc. Some very specific things. Then you can apply this to the category from earlier. How are fish and cats similar? Well, they both have eyes, they both have pharyngeal gill slits (ontogenetically, at least), they both have post-anal tails, etc. Less specific things.

&amp;#x200B;

Great. So one can put those groups into categories within each other based on comparative morphology alone. Why are fish not starfish? Because starfish (echinodermata) have 5-point symmetry, while fish have bilateral symmetry; fish have heads, starfish don't. You can generalize even further and say: OK, why are humans not algae? Well, humans need to eat food made by other things; algae make their own food. Algae are one cell (facultatively multicellular, but only very, very simply). Algae have cell walls; humans do not.

t3_es11qk,Sweary_Biochemist,"1) they build up until they're problematic. And then they're problematic, so they're selected against. It's that simple. Life will iterate to a point where most genes are 'working, but a little bit crap', because there's no selective pressure for them to improve (because they work), and active selective pressure against them getting worse (because then they won't).

Key point to remember: this has ALWAYS been the case.

&amp;#x200B;

2) it's balls. He equates 'kills humans' with viral fitness (this is not correct), and he doesn't even measure that correctly anyway.

3) It's balls. Selective pressure against humans is certainly lower in the western world (if you have eight kids, chances are all eight will survive. In the past you might need to have eight to successfully raise two). But all that means is there's greater scope for variation. Depending on how you measure fitness, you could argue that ""mean"" fitness is reducing, but only because you've lowered the lower extent. The upper extent is still *there.* To put it very crudely, helping more 3s and 4s survive does not make the 10s stop existing, but it might lower the *average score*.

4) It depends on how it was proven. Given all organisms accrue mutations at different rates (many *markedly* faster than humans) the implication is very strongly that if it exists, it is incredibly slow. If it is slower than actual *speciation*, it is meaningless. A species cannot degrade due to genetic entropy if that species has already become multiple other species.",1579641546

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; We dont see rodents give birth to anything other than rodents 

Correct. We also don't see mammals give birth to anything other than mammals. Nor do we see vertebrates give birth to anything other than vertebrates.

Nested hierarchies all the way down, and you cannot ever change your ancestry. 

Humans are apes, and mammals, and tetrapods, and vertebrates, and metazoa, and eukaryotes, and they always will be.

The prototypical creationist saw of ""we don't see dogs giving birth to cats"" or ""we don't see any animals giving birth to new kinds of animals"" misses the point spectacularly.  Evolutionary theory *never* posits this should be the case, and dogs giving birth to cats would in fact falsify common ancestry completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Both dogs and cats are carnivores: they share many traits (both genetic and phenotypic) which other clades do not possess (for example, cows are *not* carnivores, though cows, cats and dogs are all mammals). 

At some point in the past a carnivorous species that was neither cat nor dog (because those did not exist) but that was unarguably a carnivore (something like Miacis  [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacis](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacis) ) diverged into separate lineages, and those lineages became reproductively isolated (perhaps they migrated apart, or were separated by geographic changes). No longer mixing genes between the two populations, those populations were free to diverge further, and adapt to niches they now occupied. One lineage became cursorial predators, retaining all the carnivore features but specialising in running prey down (a tactic that also favoured large social groups: pack hunting). The other became ambush predators, retaining all the carnivore features but specialising in leaping down onto unsuspecting prey (a tactic that absolutely does not favour large social groups: you can't hide a pack of animals in a tree).

The former lineage were ancestral dogs, the latter ancestral cats. 

Cursorial predation (dogs) favours long legs with stiffer elbow joints and blunter claws (you're running, not pouncing) and consequently longer jaws (you bring down prey by grabbing on with your mouth).

Ambush predation (cats) favours shorter, more muscular limbs with more mobile elbows and sharper claws (you're pouncing and grabbing on with your arms), and shorter, wider jaws (you're already grabbing with your arms, so your mouth delivers the kill-stroke)

We see these morphological differences very clearly today, and yet, both groups still retain the same, shared carnivorian features of their ancestry: one ancestral lineage has diverged into two distinct lineages. At no point did dogs give birth to cats or vice versa, and at no point was this required.

(for a really neat example of evolutionary plasticity, see hyenas: these are unarguably in the cat lineage, not the dog lineage, yet they have evolved to fill a cursorial predation niche, and consequently have acquired the same sort of phenotypic traits: they have stiffer elbows, blunter claws, longer jaws and are pack animals. Cats cannot give birth to dogs, but cats *can* evolve to a state that is remarkably dog-like).

&amp;#x200B;

Thus: one group of ancestral unicellular life evolved multicellularity (possibly to escape predation: we know this can happen, as we have observed it in the lab). This was successful, and simple multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. Cell specialisations emerged (cells on the periphery might have become more flexible, while cells in the centre might have become more metabolically active), all in response to positional cues (i.e. the same cell could be either, depending on position: same organism, not a mix of two). Multicellular organisms became more complex.

Some folded, allowing greater morphological specialisations. In some cases this was really successful, so folded multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. 

Some of these folded multicellular organisms folded completely to provide a central tube. This created a core around which to build further morphological advances, so was successful. Tubed multicellular organisms proliferated, and (as mutations cannot be avoided) changed, and diverged. 

As time passes, the tube becomes a central nervous system (in some lineages), and in some descendants of those lineages, becomes a spine, and in some descendants of those lineages, becomes the spine of a jawed aquatic animal (ancestral fish). Some descendants of those primitive fish take to the land (ancestral tetrapods), and so on and so forth.

Stepwise, with every single step being a perfectly viable organism, analogues of which we can observe even today.

Part of this includes attempting to figure out the Distribution of Fitness Effects for new mutations.  What are these ""molecular changes"" you refer to? Because if you're talking about mutations, then it seems you're saying that population genetics as a field is invalid.

&gt;and mistaking a model for experimental data.

Where did I do this? Actually I showed that the models themselves predict fitness decline over time, and that the models clearly show that all mutations have some fitness effect. When you say ""experimental data"", what are you talking about, specifically? Because the papers I quoted from do refer to the results of mutation accumulation experiments that support the model. The model is based upon real-world experiments and it's based upon the fundamental nature of how mutations work, in general.",1579633618

Lol. You're unhinged because you're being shown to be a clown who can't honestly even deal with the very papers and the very definitions he's appealing to. You are hilarious!  


&gt;You are attempting to appropriate mutational definitions which rely on selection coefficients and population size to claim that it is synonymous with functional definitions at the molecular level.  

Selection coefficients are what population genetics models are all about! It's about measuring fitness and measuring (or inferring) the fitness effects of mutations through MA experiments. When you say ""functional definitions at the molecular level"", you're going outside of population genetics altogether and you're putting out a massive red herring that has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. None of what we've been quoting from Kimura, Ohta, Eyre-Walker, Keightley, etc. has had anything to do with ""functional definitions at a molecular level."" And I think you know that, deep, deep down. Or have you managed to confuse yourself in  your attempt to confuse others?  


Let's address what you quoted from Kimura in '91:  


&gt; ""If, as Ohta (1974, 1976) proposed, the majority of ""neutral mutations"" are, in reality, very slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral, the evolutionary rate is higher in smaller populations than in larger populations.   


Kimura conveniently neglected to mention this was also HIS model, which he presented in 1979. What a stunning omission! As if he was trying to pretend he did not also promote this very model...  


&gt;  **Whether such very slightly deleterious mutations are really prevalent in nature or not, I think, remains to be investigated for many genes in various organisms.**""   


In Kimura's own model from '79, which he is here trying to pretend didn't happen for some reason, these 'very slightly deleterious mutations' (effectively neutral) were a huge proportion of the overall total. And none were 'selectively neutral'. All had fitness effects. This is the same view held by modern population geneticists as well, such as Eyre-Walker and Keightley. They have stood by Ohta's model. Kimura is trying to beat around the bush by saying it ""remains to be investigated"", but that wasn't his story in '79. Something else must be going on, but he's not being forthright as to his reasons for changing his story. Certainly modern scientists still view these effectively neutral mutations as being prevalent, and the fact that they would be is so obvious as to be beyond question. Most mutations are extremely small.   


**""Mutagenesis and mutation accumulation experiments can give us detailed information about the DFE \[distribution of fitness effects\] of mutations only if they have a moderately large effect, as these are the mutations that have detectable effects in laboratory assays. However, it seems likely that many and possibly the majority of mutations have effects that are too small to be detected in the laboratory.""**  


**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

t1_ff5gtif,CHzilla117,"&gt; It has to happen somewhere more then elsewhere.

And when the difference is one is orders of magnitudes larger than everything else, it isn't chance causing it. And when the rest of the genes of the other populations are just variations of some of the more diverse population's variations, there is no room to doubt the more diverse population being the original. And when the fossil record says the exact same thing, it is pretty much overkill.

&gt;Indeed one finds very black, curly hair etc etc body details in people in South india and down through Malaysia.Yet totally unrelated to black Africans. its very possib;e there was slightly more need for changes in hot, humid, africa back in the day.

That isn't really relevant. The question is not sharing a few traits, which due to the environment would likely not have been lost in the first place, but overall diversity of both phenotypes and genotypes as well as the pattern as mentioned above. Those populations are also not as far removed from Africa as you seem to think and they are.

As for the rest, various studies have shown over and over again that all changes to body plans are determined by genetics which are changed only by mutation. Every single aspect of it, from how mutations arise, to how they change the genetic code, to how this alters the resulting protein, to how the altered protein alters the bodyplan has been rigorously tested again and again. There is frankly no room for a different mechanism to change body plans besides mutation.

And that is many creationists don't deny that. Because the evidence is ridiculously conclusive on that. But you 

I would also like your thoughts on the first paragraph of my previous comment. Ignoring that is a little suspicious.",1579628822
t1_ff6bigo,DefenestrateFriends,"&gt;You are using these terms 'functional' and 'operational' without even understanding what you are saying.

You are attempting to appropriate mutational definitions which rely on selection coefficients and population size to claim that it is synonymous with functional definitions at the molecular level. This is patently false and I even showed you why mathematically. Here it is AGAIN for the fucking fourth time, you dishonest prick. Feel free to ignore it, AGAIN, and look like an idiot, AGAIN:  


 ""If a deleterious mutation with *s* = −0.001 occurs in a population of *N* = 106, |*s*| is much greater than 1/(2*N*) = 5 × 3 10−7. The fitness of mutant homozygotes will be lower than that of wild-type homozygotes only by 0.002. This fitness difference is easily swamped by the large random variation in the number of offspring among different individuals, by which *s* is defined. By contrast, in the case of brother-sister mating *N* = 2, so that even a semi-lethal mutation with *s* = −0.25 will be called neutral. If this mutation is fixed in the population, the mutant homozygote has a fitness of 0.5 compared with the nonmutant homozygote. A fitness decrease of half is removed from the population by natural selection.""  
 

Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **22**, 2318–42 (2005).  


A selection coefficient is NOT a functional determinant of the mutation and CANNOT be used in that way. The selection coefficient definition of mutation is operationally dependent on the effective population size AS SHOWN ABOVE. It is NOT synonymous with what's happening at the molecular level. You seem unable to differentiate between the two in our conversations even Kimura is quite explicit about which definitions he is using even if your reading comprehension fails you.   


&gt; Quote Kimura's own words, and cite the source. 

You clearly still haven't read Kimura's 1991 work. It's barely 20 pages, it will take you 10 minutes, if that:   


""If, as Ohta (197 4, 1976) proposed, the majority of ""neutral mutations"" are, in reality, very slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral, the evolutionary rate is higher in smaller populations than in larger populations. This is because a very slightly deleterious mutant behaves as if selectively neutral when Nes' is much smaller than unity, where s' (&gt;O) is the selection coefficient against the mutant, and Ne is the effective population size, while it may be effectively selected against if Nes' is larger than unity. Recently, Ohta and Tachida (1990) applied the concept of ""near neutrality"" to explain the puzzling observation regarding nucleotide versus allozyme heterozygosities in D.similans, on which I have mentioned in one of the above sections. These authors assume that mutations causing protein polymorphisms are subject to stronger selection on the average (such as Nes'=0.5) compared with mutants that involve in DNA polymorphisms (such as Nes'=O.l), even if the absolute sizes of the selection coefficient (denoted by s') are very small in the ordinary sense. Taking into account the fact that D. similans has a much larger panmictic population than D. melanogaster which has the subdivided population structure, these authors claim that the contrasting pattern of polymorphisms in these two species can be understood by assuming nearly neutral mutations. **Whether such very slightly deleterious mutations are really prevalent in nature or not, I think, remains to be investigated for many genes in various organisms.**""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If this were true in any way, one would not expect Ohta's theory to be  still in use as the primary paradigm of population genetics nowadays.

I am using mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome as examples because those are specifically* non-recombinant*, your criticism here does not apply, each starting original one of those gene sequences could only have one initial collection of alleles and phenotypes. To get to the modern number from that requires mutations from the starting sequences. 

Let me make this clear, I have been referencing these two specific parts of the genome because they avoid 

&gt; The article on canidae was a referenced example of how 'selection acts upon existing variability'. The corollary of humans having this same gene pool 'tank' to draw from, as fellow mammals, should have shown the connection. It was not 'changing the topic!'

Which requires a starting population with that variety in existence. In humans that “pool” was two.  According to that paper there was a starting *population* not two dogs. 
You’re the one who keeps saying that “they don’t debate links” so please don’t use previous threads as backing for a point when I am referring to. 

Stick to my existing examples and show how it is genetically possible for non-recombinant genetic material to contain dozens of variants the exact same sections of of the sequences.

I don't see mutations and selection on them as the origin for biology bodyplan changes. Some creationists do. Instead i think the mutations are hiding greater innate ability of biology to change upon thresholds being passed.

t1_ff4xus3,Jattok,"&gt; As /u/DavidTMarks and I are saying, we are talking about a specific part of evolution that we have a problem with.

That's wonderful, so why do creationists like you and /u/DavidTMarks keep referring to these specific parts that you have problems with as ""evolution""? Do you complain about the pollution of Hummers by complaining about ""vehicles""?

&gt; You know this but don't admit it.

Should we just assume what you mean instead of you guys SAYING what you mean? Why is it our burden to understand you when you admit that you have troubles expressing yourselves properly?

&gt; I have no problem with the trivial parts of evolution (mutations being transmitted to subsequent generations, ...), I only have a problem with the part of evolution that corresponds to what the general public understands the meaning of evolution to be...

Ah, so it's everyone else's fault that they seem to fit your beliefs about evolution? Stop blaming everyone except yourself for your failure to say what you meant to say.

&gt; ...to the part of evolution that all people who have trouble swallowing the evolution story refer to.

You mean people ignorant of evolution or dishonest people. Why should you want to be hitch your wagon to those people when discussing evolution?

&gt; You don't want any terminology to be used to specify this part of evolution: you continually reject terms such as macro-evolution.

Because ""macro-evolution"" just means evolution above the species level. There's no different between it and ""micro-evolution"" except for time. Creationists like you keep using the term to argue that they're two different mechanisms, but they're not.

&gt; So the term evolution has been broadened so much as to be essentially meaningless when we try and discuss anything.

Use the correct terms and there won't be a problem. When people show you that you're using terms wrong or getting the science wrong, stop using those same wrong contexts or arguments.

&gt; You're trying to say something about one part and we are obviously talking about another part.

If it were obvious, we'd know. But you misusing a term doesn't mean it's obvious to anyone except yourself. And if you knew what you meant, why didn't you say it in the first place?

The problem is 100% yours, 0% ours.

&gt; It's pretty much as if there's a theory that predicts that the sun will rise every morning and also predicts that pigs can fly. When we can confirm the prediction that the sun rises in the morning, you say ""There! The theory's proven -- including the part that pigs can fly because it's all part of the same theory"".

Except theories in science never get proven. They can make predictions, such as ""the sun will rise tomorrow at X time,"" but that doesn't mean that the same predictive ability of this theory will be 100% correct all the time. Theories update with new information. Therefore, no theory can ever be proven, just validated or falsified.

&gt; This is patent imbecilic nonsense and a complete waste of time and energy.

Agreed, so why do creationists continue to deny the reality of evolution, constantly misuse terms, keep making well-debunked arguments and think that they, non-experts in the science, know more than the experts in the science?

You're right for the wrong reasons.

&gt; Conclusions
&gt; it's worthless trying to debate anything here. The obfuscation based on terminology never ends. There seems to be a deliberate intention to misunderstand.

Again, use the correct terms in the correct context and there's no problem with this. It's your fault that you keep failing at this, not ours.

&gt; however, one can sometimes learn interesting things inadvertently from papers and references mentioned.

And you can read the journals without being prompted. Too bad creationists tend to read just creationist sources and not scientific ones.

&gt; I think that you should also consider the nature of being human. I assume in good faith, that you (or some of you) are reasonable, intelligent people who have a good understanding of science.

We're not creationists, so there's a good chance that your statement is true.

&gt; I know that this describes me.

Not in a million years. You've been wrong so often that it's questionable whether you have a real M.Sc. But that's just how I feel; you still get much of evolutionary biology wrong.

&gt; And yet here we are with diametrically opposed understandings of a particular issue.

Yet one side is objectively right and creationists are objectively wrong. Weird, huh?

&gt; What does this tell us? It says that there is something about the human mind that is prone to very strong conclusions and biases, to rationalisations and justifications.

We know. Religious beliefs lead people to ignore the reality which contradicts these beliefs. That's why creationists are just as much deniers of science as flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, etc.

&gt; This happens in all areas of life. It seems to be absolutely impossible for me to get you to see things the way that I see them (and probably vice versa).

Incorrect. We can comprehend what you're arguing, and then we explain why your arguments are wrong. Seeing what your side is is not the same as agreeing that your side is correct.

&gt; I am so convinced that the way that I see things is correct (in this area, not in all areas) - and you haven't got a hope of changing it, until perhapsI really feel convinced that you understand my point of view and can see things my way. I think that this is true of almost everyone.

That's called being close-minded. That makes you most likely wrong. Probably 90+% of the regulars here on /r/debateevolution would change our minds when given sufficient evidence that what we know is wrong. I would. Problem is, creationists can't provide a single shred of evidence for creationism, and often try to argue against evolution using bad logic or outright lies.

So if you want things to change, you have to change. We're the ones open-minded and able to understand other views. You just don't want to give up your beliefs, no matter how often they're shown to be wrong.",1579579041
t1_ff4xus3,DarwinZDF42,"&gt; we are talking about a specific part of evolution that we have a problem with.

Okay, but you can't just say ""the word evolution only applies to this stuff we disagree on"". 

&gt;You don't want any terminology to be used to specify this part of evolution: you continually reject terms such as macro-evolution.

*Because it is not a term biologists use the way you want to use it!*

Do you not see the problem here? You're introducing terms, e.g. ""macroevolution"" and ""devolution"" into a scientific debate *that are not used by the field in question* (at least not the way you're using them). You can't just make up words, or have your own special definitions. 

This is why I constantly ask things like ""what's the mechanism that prevents outcome X from happening?"" or ""what specifically counts as 'macroevolution'?"" or ""how do you quantify information?"". If we focus on the traits and processes, rather than the terms, we can actually have a discussion. Getting continually hung up on the terms is a waste of time. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You're trying to say something about one part and we are obviously talking about another part.

I don't think this is the case, but I can't know because *I don't know how you're defining the words you're using.* What's macroevolution, *to you*? Does a new endosymbiotic organelle count? Does a new ""irreducible"" biochemical trait count? Does a virus evolving from a plasmid count? I have no idea! And I've [literally been asking for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/70iux9/for_real_define_macroevolution/). 

If you, or any creationist, could provide a consistent definition for ""macroevolution"", we could actually talk about whether or not that happens. But all I ever get are excuses.",1579576940
t1_fewfvuu,MRH2,"&gt; Yes, a major problem is the stubborn refusal to simply use the correct definitions for words like ""evolution"" and ""fitness"". I totally agree.

and from /u/jattok: 

&gt;That's not a type of evolution. That's evolution. Period. It's creationists who keep trying to say that there are more than one type of evolution.

As /u/DavidTMarks and I are saying, we are talking about a specific part of evolution that we have a problem with. You know this but don't admit it. I have no problem with the trivial parts of evolution (mutations being transmitted to subsequent generations, ...), I only have a problem with the part of evolution that corresponds to what the general public understands the meaning of evolution to be, to the part of evolution that all people who have trouble swallowing the evolution story refer to.

t1_ff4nxwr,ursisterstoy,"You’d think that there’d be something in place to reverse the unconstitutional laws that are allowed to persist anyway such as requiring a religious belief to hold political office or the promotion by the government to insert religious ideas into the pledge of allegiance or on our currency or the displaying of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse. Even when such provisions exist to stop these laws, ordinances, and statutes from being enforced they continue to persist anyway. A government official who knowingly allows this type of behavior or is responsible for it is in direct violation of the primary document upon which our laws are based upon, which should be a felony even if it isn’t. However because of fairness laws a simple repeal of unconstitutional laws and the removal from office should be the minimum punishment for these actions and they don’t even get a slap on the wrist but commit some other felony and not only do you spend time in prison but you are banned from employment in fields related to your crimes. Why this doesn’t happen for government officials who knowingly break the law, or the document upon which our laws are meant to be based around, and are allowed to continue holding office is beyond me but use your political position for profit that doesn’t effect the general person nearly as much or violate our humans rights provided by this document and get removed from office and have potential criminal persecution. Something similar nearly happened with Donald Trump over a telephone call if I’m not mistaken but when it comes to the majority of congress and the Vice President wanting to teach creationism in the science class room and they continue holding office despite the obvious violation. 

I wouldn’t know what to call this crime but the principal of the matter is that our country is founded on the Declaration of Independence and the constitutional amendments, especially the first ten of them and when these are deliberately overlooked and violated by top government official the violation becomes law despite the regulations in place that are supposed to prevent this from happening and when they commit a smaller crime in that isn’t mentioned in our founding documents they risk losing their jobs, ability to hold office in the future, and possibly imprisonment based on how blatantly or purposely they broke the law and how breaking the law is supposed to violate national security or provide an unfair benefit because of their government office.",1579573271
t3_ercz37,GaryGaulin,"If we were not ""Created"" by something then none of us would exist. 

The real question is: ""How does our Creator work?""

To recap what I have on that topic:

Earliest stage molecular scale designs did not require complex metabolism to power muscle cells and such, which came later so that essentially plant and animal cells could better eat each other.

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05098-w

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

*The role of sugar-backbone heterogeneity and chimeras in the simultaneous emergence of RNA and DNA -- Paywall*

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-019-0322-x

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

t1_ff2yn60,ursisterstoy,"Well considering that we actually observe the first without cherry picking a few examples that are on the the brink of extinction and therefore survive mostly because of inbreeding like the cheetah the overwhelming majority of evidence is in concordance with the first hypothesis.

Genetics don’t deteriorate and become deleterious for survival and reproduction and yet get passed on because dead and infertile organisms don’t have children. It is the survivors and the evidently small change even after six million years of divergence that demonstrates that genetic entropy as described isn’t really a thing. The second point of the second hypothesis is refuted by dog breeds. They started out as two or three varieties of wolf and they diversified (genetically) into several hundred breeds. The third is also refuted but harder to find in the fossil record that contains mostly bones and not well preserved brains, hearts, and digestive systems though we have the genetic evidence and several examples of living organisms showing intermediate traits like all different stages of eye complexity, several different styles of heart ranging from what is found in a worm to what is found in birds and mammals, and several intermediate digestive tracts such that some lack various components entirely like the colon and others have extra features such as multichambered stomachs. We can just compare the genes of these living organisms to know how much change is necessary and calculate the amount of time necessary for this change to occur naturally via the same process by which you used previously for calculating the time of divergence for the ancestor of living dogs, wolves, and foxes and again for living humans without considering how this very same molecular dating process is also used for calculating the origins of more inclusive clades like monkeys, euarchontaglires, placental mammals, or opisthokonts and all the way up to the origin of eukaryotes and the the first life forms before that. When all of the evidence is accounted for it clearly favors the scientific consensus which wouldn’t be a problem unless you held a contradictory dogmatic assumption. I go where the evidence leads and not where I wish it would instead. And that is precisely why I’m not a young Earth creationist. None of the fallacies you like to accuse me of apply here.

t1_ff2ylcu,ursisterstoy,"Yes natural selection tends to result in fewer available genes to be passed on but this only makes sense if there are mutations that arise that are selected out by this process naturally in the environment. Artificial selection is similar but not identical as humans are the selective pressure selecting out what they want from the end product instead of what would inevitably result by natural selection in the environment. For instance, if left to their own devices domesticated dogs would still be wolves as this provides a better survival benefit in the wild than an animal that requires human involvement for survival but even then we still get biodiversity because of processes that introduce variety that can be selected for. If there was no variety there would be nothing to act upon and we’d either have no effect from natural selection or complete groups going extinct by environmental pressures that none of them can survive. This obviously doesn’t happen with either of these processes so it would be important to include the whole picture if you’re going to argue against just one piece of the puzzle - the part that removed deleterious or undesirable genes from the population in favor of the more beneficial or desirable ones that accumulate over time in both cases.",1579563519
t3_ercz37,ursisterstoy,"So evolution by natural selection demands a designer because you either don’t know the facts or you choose to lie about them?

The very same process is the only process that explains biodiversity as you explained that reproduction and natural selection play some of the vital roles in evolution though you forgot to mentioned the **measured** mutation rates like those make calculating the time since the MRCA of any clade like you provided for the species Homo sapiens or the entire clade of Canids (dogs). 

Just admitting that felines and panthers are related further complicates your position of separate ancestry as this is a clear example of biodiversity at work. One major noticeable difference is that felines purr and meow while the panthers roar instead. House cats are not the only felines when we can include cheetahs and bobcats and similar cats but panthers include lions and tigers. Move up a couple clades and the ancestor of cats, weasels, dogs, foxes, bears, skunks, hyenas, raccoons and wolverines and several other “kinds” of life was the same animal. Go up a few more clades and now horses, rhinos, hippos, whales, bats, and others join the group. All of these originally originated from something resembling a shrew while on our side of the split the tree shrew is a very similar animal and the elephant shrew from atlantogenata. All of these groups evidentially began looking like a shrew and look at all the diversity since. A loss of biodiversity would suggest that everything either went extinct or interbred so that we got a hybrid of everything instead of the actual branching hierarchy we observe in nature. Successive, usually superficial changes compiled on top of fundamental similarities drives biodiversity and when the population divides so that these changes occur in each group but not the same changes across the entire group it results in the growing trend towards speciation driving the emergence of every one of the clades of our evolutionary phylogeny. The same process by which all cats emerged from the same species (and not just two animals riding on a boat) is the same process by which all carnivores (the clade containing cats, dogs, bears, and pangolins) diverged from a common ancestor and when we go back further in time of up a few clade levels continental drift isolated a few different sub populations of shrew shaped mammal so that we get Laurasiatheria, Atlantogenata, and Euarchontoglires emerging from shrews and considering the armadillo is just a heavily armored version of the same thing the same thing applies to Xenarthra or the armadillos, aardvarks, and sloths. We even have something even older than than this split called juramaia which takes us a lot closer to the split between Eutherians and Metatherians and if including all of these mammals doesn’t provide enough biodiversity from a common ancestor I don’t know what will as the only remaining living mammals are three species that still lay eggs like the common ancestor of all mammals evidently did as well before our group first lost the shell, then developed a placenta to replace the depleting yolk sac, and then subsequently lost the epipubic bones before the males in hominae slowly lost the penis bone as well. There are many more obvious changes that occurred along the way but as this is a continuously branching tree of life with a lot of extinct things along the way despite the continuous increase in diversity among the survivors there isn’t enough time or space to discuss all of them in a single response.

Devolving doesn’t even make sense for someone aware that evolution isn’t driven by a teleological goal. It happens in all possible directions with “possible” being a key word here and natural selection killing off different lineages so that the inevitable result is a diverse array of different populations fit for their environment and their reproductive success and fewer and fewer that acquire deadly mutations or mutations that result in infertility for obvious reasons. If you need it explained, it is as simple as evolution requiring reproduction that can’t happen with sterile and dead organisms so that deliterious mutations are less likely to be passed on than beneficial ones regardless of their rate of occurrence at the beginning due to essentially random mutation.",1579562759

t1_ff4cchk,Dzugavili,"&gt;Just curious - where did ICR ‘disown’ the RATE project? 

They didn't disown the RATE project: they disowned the C14 in coal argument. 

The simple answer is that when you send a sample to a lab, they give you the results with no interpretation, because they don't know what you're looking for. 95,000 years is the result you'd expect for a calibration sample looking for machine error -- and you might ask a third party to run a sample like this if you were concerned that your AMS isn't working properly anymore.

Otherwise, the RATE project did admit there were two problems they couldn't solve for: radiometric heat and radiometric dating. It wasn't exactly a raging success.

&gt;And what exactly does evolution suggest about vestigial organs?

/r/creation chirps on how evolution claims vestigial organs have no function. That's not actually what has ever been suggested.

Vestigial simply means it doesn't do what it used to do in another organism; the appendix doesn't produce enzymes for breaking down cellulose anymore, which makes it vestigial. But we never suggested it would be functionless -- this is just another definition taken to an extreme.

There are theistic evolutionists who believe that the entire process is a guided one such that intelligent design arguments slip in from time to time for how a god was necessary for something and there are those that believe in a supernatural creation event followed by a purely naturalistic and unguided process made possible because of this god. The less involved gods are less “theistic” and more “deistic” in that they did something so that we would have something rather than nothing or they were responsible for the so-called mystery at the bottom of physics and why the different constants have particular values. The deist god still relies heavily on fallacious reasoning but at least such ideas allow for physics to take over from there without any supernatural intervention so that once the universe exists the rest of their views are nearly the same as an atheistic and nihilistic physicalist. And the even less “god-like” gods are ancient aliens, computer simulation designers, or pantheist gods where the universe itself is god. These ideas don’t really qualify as biblical creationists but two of them are heavily flawed for other reasons and the last is pointless in that they are basically atheists who refuse to admit it.

Later, a duplication combining a susceptible and a resistance *ace-1* allele began to spread but did not replace the original resistance allele, as it is sublethal when homozygous. Last, a second duplication, (also sublethal when homozygous) began to spread because heterozygotes for the two duplications do not exhibit deleterious pleiotropic effects. Double overdominance now maintains these four alleles across treated and nontreated areas. Thus, *ace-1* evolution does not proceed via the steady accumulation of beneficial mutations.

&amp;#x200B;

Evolution is not constrained to a ""lottery pick"" of already-existing genes.  The genome is constantly mutating to produce new variation, and selection (and other processes) simply weeds out the bad variations.  There is no shortage of novel variation to select from, and new variation happens all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How can organisms 'advance' into more complexity, if they are in reality, '**devolving', and decreasing in variability**?

As the papers cited above show, your question is built on a flawed premise.  In general, organisms are not ""devolving"" or ""decreasing in variability"".  Sure, decrease in variability occurs, but it's the exception rather than the rule.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How do you reconcile the OBSERVABLE reality of fewer traits being available, in a 'low diversity' organism, with the belief that they are constantly adding new traits, genes, chromosomes, etc? How could common ancestry be possible, when organisms DECREASE in variability, through natural or man made selection?

Are you asserting that ALL populations are low-diversity?  Because you've cited exactly one source in this post, and it discusses the fact that ONE particular species is low-diversity.  If snow leopards are low-diversity, what's that got to do with all the other life on Earth?  Can't E. coli be high-diversity even if snow leopards are low-diversity?

You also seem to be asserting that organisms (or perhaps you mean populations) decrease in variability over time, as a rule.  Could you provide a citation which supports this assertion?",1579543483

You can be wrong without being a liar. 

The human body **is** complex but evolution fully explains how it evolved. For example, every human is the product of their parents having sex and if we take this back generation after generation eventually these ancestors start looking a lot more like Homo sapiens idaltu until they are members of that subspecies. Keep going and the ancestor is something like Homo rhodesiensis, further yet Homo heidelbergensis, then Homo antecessor, then Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo habilis and so forth. There are several competing species for our link between Homo and Australopithecus that have been classified as each, plus a more recent discovery than any that I’m about to mention here that may be the actual “missing link.” Australopithecus sediba, Kenyanthropus platyops, and Homo rudolfensis are three such intermediates even if our ancestry doesn’t flow through any of them directly just like the Homo heidelbergensis mentioned earlier may actually represent the split from our lineage that branched off to become Homo neanderthalensis and Homo denisova. If that’s the case Homo rhodesiensis or Homo sapiens idaltu split from Homo antecessor directly instead. Within Australopithecus there are several intermediates such as Australopithecus ghari, Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus afarensis, and Australopithecus anamensis on the gracile side of things (like us) and they likely diverged from the more robust hominins like Paranthropus bosei before this. Before Australopithecus there are two known species of Ardipithecus, and a couple species categorized into a couple different genuses like Ororrin and Sahelanthropus before we get to the split in hominini between what would become human and what would become chimpanzees and bonobos. And still we are talking about complex life but no longer talking about humans as evolution has demonstrated and explained the origin of humans without having to match all the way back to abiogenesis. Move the goal post and the process continues all the way back to every other clade we are still part of, the origin of life, planetary formation, nuclear fusion, the other physical processes that account for everything within the universe like stars, galaxies, black holes, dust clouds and a few ideas exist to explain dark matter and dark energy that don’t require a supernatural explanation and yet the same physics, the one that tells us how everything actually is, also keeps our smoke detectors working and allows us to determine how long ago some event occurred because of radiometric dating. We can also calibrate the more recent events with molecular clock dating, dendrochronology, ice cores and several other methods related to how light is reflected. The observed speed of light and trigonometry determining the observed distance to a far away object is also a powerful dating method when considering the observable part of the cosmos, called the observable universe because if we can see it and we know the minimum amount of time necessary to see it we know how much time has passed at a minimum. If it takes 13.8 billion years for the light to reach us then it was *at least* 13.8 billion years ago that the light first traveling in our direction and for other reasons I shouldn’t have to discuss here as we are far beyond biology even in your comment about the age of the planet, light can’t travel any faster. This is a fundamental principle in physics and is the basis for Einstein’s relativity that provided the framework for a Catholic priest to suggest that the theory predicts universal expansion and when they set out to test the hypothesis, essentially proving Lamaître right, they were mocked for thinking that the entire universe could come from a “Big Bang” so the name stuck despite not actually being an explosion of anything but likely a continuation of eternal inflation far beyond the limits of general relativity to fully explain and even quantum mechanics starts to fall apart. Before the Big Bang, expansion was already going on, before that is anyone’s guess. Despite the complete lack of evidence and the physical impossibility, this is what deism attempts to explain with a god of the gaps fallacy. Starting with this and giving it qualities that make it the god of Christianity or one of the gods of Hinduism or Ahura Mazda would already be unsupported human invented concepts and the books portraying these different types of god are evidently the creation of groups of people holding subjective opinions about what may not even exist who wrote these myths about creation. It is theses myths in the Bible and the calculations of Ussher that provide the view that we live on a planet created in 4004 BC though we have cities, trees, fossils older than this. The global flood, the exodus out of Egypt, and other things the Bible claims happened also never happened but this discussion was supposed to be about creationism vs evolution- a religious myth vs a scientific theory and not about whether or not there is a god. Even with a god, the universe is evidently at least 13.8 billion years old. Even with a god, our planet is still 4.5-4.6 billion years old. Even with a god, the origin of life is called abiogenesis not avra kadavra and even with a god, evolution is both a fact and the theory that adequately describes it.",1579538528

Yes, no evidence. Because going from many alleles to few looks different from going from few alleles to many. They are not merely opposite processes.

Mice however have a generation time that is \~125 times faster than humans (\~10 weeks) so mice serve as a perfect sentinel species for genetic entropy: if we see mice suddenly go downhill, then maybe Sanford has a story.

The problems with this are manifold.

1. Even if we take Sanford's young earth timeline, mice and humans are both \~6000 years old, so if GE is rapid and abrupt (and actually exists) and mice suddenly take a nosedive in the next ten years, we know we have 750,000 years of prep time before we follow suit.
2. Three million year old mouse fossils  [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/3-million-year-old-mouse-just-gave-scientists-key-decoding-ancient-red-pigments](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/3-million-year-old-mouse-just-gave-scientists-key-decoding-ancient-red-pigments) suggest that any GE component (if it exists) is really, really fucking slow, and if present, will affect us \~125 times slower than mice, thus giving us about 4 billion years warning.
3. Mice are fine. Absolutely fine. Mutational accumulator mice (as noted in the link at the top) are NOT fine, and they have a mutation rate \~17x times higher than regular mice, so *too many mutations per generation* absolutely are a thing, but regular mice do not have this problem, and have been around for a long, long time. So genetic entropy does not appear to exist in...you know, actual wild-type species.

At the starting (In Biblical creationism) created population of humans there were 2 people, so at most each gene could only have a max of 4 allele variations. (Then most love got reduces back to a pair on animals during the flood again reducing the variation to 4 allele sets per species/baramin) Given that currently there is far more variety in most creatures than 4 alleles per gene, I think that something is obviously deeply wrong with this hypothetical.

Which assumes that your god is both real and that Genesis was literal. Considering how they very people that put it in the Bible thought it was metaphorical and how Genesis 1 says Adam was made after plants and animals with Eve being made at the same time while Genesis 2 says that he made before animals and plants and Eve was made after them, saying it is literal just falsifies your entire religion. So that is not a good reason to deny science.

&gt; i am confident that there is not accurate evidence for the African origin thing.

Your confidence is based on the assumption you are right, which is based on assumptions based on some weird theology, not any flaw in the evidence or any evidence or supporting a different area. For you accuracy is based on whether on not something fits your preconceptions instead of the methods. Confirmation bias is not going to get you any closer to the truth.

&gt;As I said easily dNA diversity in Africa could come from a need to diversify from envirorment problems.

Which is nothing more than special pleading because, as I have repeatably stated, numerous other human population also lived similar or worse environments and do not show the same result.

Also, all attempts to see how populations adapt to new conditions have shown the exact same thing: mutations happening at the same rate as they before but those with mutations that make them better at surviving the new conditions having higher odds of survival, leading to the gene in question slowly becoming more prevalent in the population. What you say would happen never does.  

&gt; the rest of the joining the dots also can be seen as special cases for the OBVIOUS case that sub saharan africans are the most different peoples in slightly more traits then the nexy groups.

So? The original human population being more genetically diverse would also predict them being more phenotypically diverse. It would be odd if they weren't (which the population you assert was the original isn't). And no other mechanism can account for that diversity without a very far back point of divergence from other populations. And the possible genomes for the population that would leave them as even vaguely consistent with what the original population would look like being ridiculously specific, and they fit it perfectly Add in fossils saying the exact same thing, and the evidence of humanity coming out of Africa is very, very strong.

You have yet to show anything against it, and have been desperate to avoid mentioning the other lines of evidence besides genetics saying the exact same thing. Nor have you offered any actual evidence to support your position, just hand waving and special pleading to try to keep believing what your holy books claims, which as shown above, is likely not even what it claims (and certainly is not, if you assume it is true and without contradiction).",1579500501

This whole idea with genetic entropy is already refuted by all of the other evidence for the age of the Earth and common ancestry but when examining the claim directly it fails even harder as the majority of mutations don’t result in disease, infertility, or death and the ones that do result in infertility or death don’t get passed on. After several hundred thousand year Homo sapiens are still around and so are chimpanzees that diverged from our lineage around six to seven million years ago with a very small difference even by comparing the whole genome. As expected, the non-functional DNA contains the most variance such that 98.4% similarity in coding genes equates to only about 96% similarity across the entire genome between humans and chimpanzees but by the time we get to about 90% similarity between mice and men the entire genome is only about 50% identical, especially when we account for genes located on different chromosomes more often in more distantly related populations and located in the same location on the same chromosomes in the most closely related organism. And then when we account for pseudogenes being non-functional because of the same mutation across an entire clade or the evidence found in the acquisition and inheritance of endogenous retroviruses and molecular clock dating matching closely with the fossil record and the methods for dating the remains everything is stacked in favor of evolution, an old Earth, and common ancestry - **especially** among the apes.

The actual complexity of current life after 4 billion years of evolution following several hundred thousand year of chemistry giving rise to life is supposed to support a young Earth and a recent creation how? The same scientists that reveal the complexity also explain how it  evolved when they examine the evidence. The actual details are inconsistent with separate ancestry, intelligent design, and supernatural intervention where some of the traits being so specific and unique that they most likely only evolved once and when multiple lineages share this trait - the same genes in the same locations surrounded by the same endogenous retroviruses in the same locations surrounded by pseudogenes and other matching garbage it points to common ancestry via a process prone to mutations. Some of these lead to death or infertility and don’t get passed on while the rest, especially any beneficial ones, tend to spread throughout the population so long as they are still genetically inter-fertile because if they’re genetically isolated for long enough they diverge into separate species (meaning they can no longer produce fertile offspring) and these mutations are only found to be nearly identical within one group providing the evidence of speciation in the past. Some times separate lineages converge on a similar trait because of the environment but without matching each other exactly because of how they develop independently and don’t spread their unique traits to each other after they are no longer inter-fertile. 

All of the evidence is consistent with a mindless process occurring over millions and billions of years such that after six million years chimpanzees and humans look very different to us yet they are still 98.4% identical to us genetically just considering the known coding regions and still 96% the same when accounting for all of the genetic differences such as the merged chromosome or the mutations in the junk DNA that doesn’t do anything but take up space. If it takes six million years for that much divergence then it takes even more to account for humans and mice being 90% identical in the coding regions and 50% identical by whole genome comparison accounting for junk like ancient viral gene and the broken protein coding gene mutations that show a clear evolutionary relationship but a more distant one. This is the same way we test for paternity but going much much further back and the same way we test for how long ago modern humans split from the ancestral Y chromosome haplogroup A and the mitochondria haplogroup L lived but with whole genome comparison provides us an estimate for how long ago the most recent common ancestor of a clade was alive.

&amp;#x200B;

but sure i will respond to that post since you seem to need my review. This is just ignorant  


&gt; but I'm a forking evolutionary biologist. I'm *telling* you what the word ""evolution"" means. You can continue to insist it means something else, but that's just going to make me not take you seriously.

Skipping  what caliber biologist you  are it doesn't mean you set the meaning  of words in all contexts.  That's not a biological field . Thats linguistics.

because you can't have your cake an eat it too. Since there's only one definition according to you in all contexts, then  all creationists accept evolution and so accept science.

t1_few45k7,CHzilla117,"&gt;Anything you say is just lines of reasoning from very minor data points.

The data from genetics is not minor but expansive and leaves no other real alternative. As is that of fossils. And both line up perfectly.

&gt; The diversity thing does not work for your side. it works for the creationist side or anyone denying diversity in genes equals that ara as the origin of all genes.

This is just an assertion. It you genuinely think it is true (as opposed simply wishing it were so), say how it does not work for evolution and does for yours. Because both being significantly more diverse and all other population's genomes being subtypes of the African genomes various subtypes of genes is exactly what evolution and Homo sapiens coming out of Africa would predict. None of the data has followed what creationism predicts and all you have done is struggle to come up with excuses and baseless claims that were already fasified a long before you came up with them.

That about it this way: if the population of the Middle East was the most diverse, all other types of alleles were subtypes of certain subtypes of their genes, and to try to explain it I was making up excuse like saying the mutation rate must have increased in the Middle Eastern population somehow (despite problem of how lethal that would be), how would you react?

&gt; By the way the envirormental needs of blacks there would be apparent

If so then explain them. This entire time you have just been making assertions. I hate to say it, but it comes off exactly like when someone is in denial and trying to come up with excuses.

&gt;and also a little that way in southern india etc but not as much.

I am not sure what you are even trying to what were? What is in what way in India?

&gt;OKAY now you retreat to patterns.

No. While the level of diversity on its own is significant, I am just going into more detail as to why what you are saying is absurd.

&gt; Its just evidence of genetic changes on a larger scale relative to other humans from a original tribe in the middle east.

All scientific evidence shows humanity coming out of Africa with no evidence for their genetic diversity being due to genetic change. Nor is there any scientific evidence of them being descended from Middle Eastern populations. But since your holy book says something else, or more apparently you think its says something else, you are just trying to find ways to ignore the scientific data. Can you at least admit that without the bias of your religion, that scientific evidence points toward Africa as the place of humanity's orgins?

&gt;One can make genetics fit anything because its just messing around with a original genetic score.

""Genetic score"" is not a term that means anything, so I am not entirely sure exactly what you are trying to say. But what genetics says does not offer the room for interpretation you prefer. Also saying ""One can make genetics fit anything"" and ""The diversity thing does not work for your side. it works for the creationist side"" are contradictory statements.

&gt;out of africa is out of scientific evidence for its wild claims.

This is just hypocritical. All you have done is make wild, baseless claims to try to ignore the data. Both genetic data and fossil evidence show humanity coming out of Africa and no scientific evidence shows otherwise. You have yet to give any evidence for your beyond your holy book saying so.",1579410286

&gt;If it was just a change in DNA that's completely junk then that wouldn't be evolution.

No...it's any change in allele frequency. Discernible effect or not.

Yes, a major problem is the stubborn refusal to simply use the correct definitions for words like ""evolution"" and ""fitness"". I totally agree.",1579409911
t1_fephby3,brandon7s,You have no idea what an ad hominen actually is.,1579409549
t1_fevzp59,DarwinZDF42,"&gt;okay, but the problem with your last point here (A and B) is that each one, being harmful would get selected out by natural selection, unless the second one happened quite quickly after the first one.

Unless the fitness landscape changed. Which happens all the time.

What's a fitness landscape? It's a way to conceptualize the fitness effects of genotypes and their ""distance"" (number of differences) from each other. 

Under some conditions, a particular genotype might help, but it might hurt under others. In humans, for example, having the sickle-cell allele in a population is beneficial in areas with endemic malaria, harmful otherwise. 

Likewise, many resistance mutations are helpful only the presence of the antibiotic. In its absence, the resistance genotype is harmful. In other words, the fitness landscape is variable - the fitness effects of specific alleles vary according to the environmental conditions. 

&amp;nbsp;

The other thing here is something I mentioned before: the parallel nature of evolution. It isn't a single lineage ""trying"" one mutation at a time. Some get one, some get another, some get the first than the second, or the second than the first, etc. It isn't just one try oops dead end we're all dead now.

Yes, the earlier paper looks at the same enzyme, but a different antibiotic.

In one of your earlier posts, you *literally* said ""Evolution isn't happening, it's one of these two other things"" and then went on to describe two *evolutionary* pathways. Like, you *very precisely* described convergent evolution, right after saying you don't think that's a thing that happens, and maybe it's one of these other things instead. So idk what to tell you.

&gt; Now with this definition (evolution is the change in frequency of alleles in a population over generations), why then everyone and their dog must obviously believe in evolution.

So you're arguing that because creationists don't want to learn about stuff at a 9th grade level, and because they keep misusing terms and being completely ignorant about subjects they argue are wrong, that's our fault that they subscribe to something like ID that isn't even remotely scientific?

&gt; Evolution is the change in frequency of alleles in a population over generations. It literally tests the sustainability of a population as mutations are introduced to see whether the necessary five mutations can arise in any order. Instead, they see that only certain orders benefit the organisms and thus are the most likely ways that the new very beneficial allele can arise.  It demonstrates evolution beautifully. So how is it that you're not seeing this?

/u/DarwinZDF42 : 

&gt; you don't seem to want to understand how evolution works or what evolutionary biology is about. You continue to insist on using terms like ""devolution"" that are nonsensical in evolutionary biology.  [...] That is convergent evolution. You just described convergent evolution. [...] Epigenetics is a form of gene regulationterm d. ... This is also evolution It's not some alien thing. The nuts and bolts are the same as other processes: mutation, variation, selection, etc. 

I see the problem here. I am actually surprised that you don't see it too, given that you've spent so much time arguing with creationists for years. You(pl) are defining evolution as any sort of change in an organism that is passed down to it's progeny. Any change, whether harmful or beneficial to its long term survival. Presumably the change has to be something that has some effect and can be selected against. If it was just a change in DNA that's completely junk then that wouldn't be evolution. 

Now with this definition (evolution is the change in frequency of alleles in a population over generations), why then everyone and their dog must obviously believe in evolution. It's obvious. It happens all the time. Regularly.  We can see it, we can measure it, we can document it. No one would ever dispute that alleles change in a population. How did I ever not know that this is what you're talking about?

 So what's the issue?

The issue, and I'm SURE that you realize this, is that everyone completely agrees and believes in this type of evolution, but not the type of evolution that can create new complex features, even if they are claimed to come via a sequence of simple steps. Everyone agrees that it is possible to cross a river on a sequence of stepping stones, but that doesn't mean that you can cross the Atlantic that way. You can't create new complex information, new body plans, new phyla, classes and probably even orders.  We're not arguing that you can't have one species splitting into two, that fish in caves lose their eyesight, we're talking about actual evolution of new things, not breaking existing things -- and I think that we need a term for it if de-evolution doesn't work. Breaking things, losing eyesight, losing flight is not evolution.

Surely you know that THIS is the issue that I have and other creationists and those who feel that evolution doesn't work so they have to support some form of ID.

many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization""

&gt;&gt; In principle, there might be 120 pathways to all five mutations. In principle. If you really want to have a discussion, please don't misstate authors' meaning.

Okay. To me they really did sound surprised, but maybe they wrote it this way for dramatic effect. I do get your point ""If you really want to have a discussion, please don't misstate authors' meaning"" and I'll have to quote it back to people when they misstake my meanings too.

&gt; More importantly, the problem is that you're assuming each mutation as harmful, neutral, or beneficial in an absolute sense, when that isn't the case. Context matters.

umm... what? What else can a mutation be? Don't harmful, neutral or beneficial cover all the bases? What is it about context that you mean? Do you mean that it can be harmful now, but when combined with other mutations that happen very quickly, it can be beneficial?

... never mind. You explained it: ""once mutation 5 occurs, mutations 2 and 4 become beneficial""

&gt; One a mutation has a negative effect, but combined with another has a positive effect, that second mutation that interacts epistatically is called a compensatory mutation. These are extremely important in the context of antibiotic resistance. It's very often the case that a resistance allele has a negative effect on fitness, but compensatory mutations partially or fully reverse it.

&gt; If everything had a single, constant fitness effect, that would make evolution much harder. Epistasis makes it way easier to evolve new things, by vastly expanding the universe of mutations that are potentially a net benefit. So you can have potential mutation A that is bad and potential mutation B that is bad, but together, there're beneficial. That wouldn't be the case without epistasis.

... okay, but the problem with your last point here (A and B) is that each one, being harmful would get selected out by natural selection, unless the second one happened quite quickly after the first one.

I think your second similar study is actually addressing the same enzyme (according to the title).

Be that as it may, I think that I can say that I'd be okay with the idea of evolution of bacteria evolving to be better bacteria, also going along with one of your other comments about mutations being beneficial (lactase, high altitudes, ...).

t1_fdk1n5a,kinglucent,"He believes that all (or at least nearly all) functional genetic information was ""written"" by a Creator (namely, Jesus pre-incarnate) in a special creation event. Time thus isn't required to produce \*new\* novel functional genetic information. He says ""natural selection, even such that produces speciation, fits quite well within the creationist framework. In fact, the creationist framework depends upon rapid (relatively speaking) speciation. We can actually observe speciation in our lifetimes, so this fits well with creationist expectations.

Mutation can be a source of that variety. But more to the point, even if only a pair of canines, for example, survived the flood, a small % of gene loci with different alleles could produce an extremely large number of possible genetic combinations. It seems reasonable to think that much of the potential for variety could have *already been coded* in the DNA of the ancestral forms of today’s animals. We can calculate numbers of possible combinations in this sense, but those numbers alone wouldn't prove the point.

I think what we’ve observed is much more compelling. Dog, cat, and even bird breeding provide some examples of how quickly (centuries or decades) large amounts of variation can appear (I love the little ""Budgie Buddie"" birds at the Point Defiance Zoo, which are bred for a variety of colors and even sizes not typically found in their natural habitat). Speciation in nature has been observed and documented in our lifetimes. Is it out-of-hand unreasonable, then, to think it plausible that thousands of years is enough time to produce the biodiversity we see today?

Whether the selection pressures are artificial or natural, the keyword is ""selection"". As you know, natural selection is not a \*source\* of new genetic information; it can only “select” from \*existing\* traits. The evolutionist (generally) argues that mutation (filtered by natural selection) is a sufficient mechanism to produce genetic information. The creationist argues that mutation and natural selection may help to diversify creation, but they simply cannot create new unique body plans; an intelligent designer is the only sufficient explanation for the vast amounts of genetic information in our world today. 

If population numbers are the concern, it only takes \*very\* conservative birthrate/population growth estimates to reach our \~8 billion human population today, for example. If animal migration is the concern, various case studies can serve to show how quickly a species can migrate and even populate vast areas.

Note though, that every challenge to evolution I've offered prior to this assumes a 4.3 billion year earth history. So regardless of how you feel about my worldview, I think there are still valid questions about whether evolution is the best explanation for the earth's biodiversity.""",1579382862

t1_fesnej2,Jattok,"&gt; Not only does it not show anything about evolution to me, let alone convergent or iterative evolution, it's just weird.

Evolution is the change in frequency of alleles in a population over generations. It literally tests the sustainability of a population as mutations are introduced to see whether the necessary five mutations can arise in any order. Instead, they see that only certain orders benefit the organisms and thus are the most likely ways that the new very beneficial allele can arise.

It demonstrates evolution beautifully. So how is it that you're not seeing this?

For convergent evolution, it appears that what /u/DarwinZDF42 is trying to show you is that selective pressures aid the emergence of necessary beneficial alleles. That is, if a trait is highly advantageous and would be highly improbable to arise all on its own, it is still possible given that only certain trajectories that would give rise to the trait would win out. If it's possible and it becomes more improbable thanks to selection, then the trait would arise more than once given different origins.

&gt; First please clarify: are these 5 mutations ones that can happen consecutively with time in between, or are they ones that must happen simultaneously?

They test these mutations arising consecutively, and find that most of them grant no benefit or make the original allele less beneficial. Also, some were even found to be less fixable due to selection pressures.

It is only through certain steps that any benefit and fixation in the population works. So all five do not need to happen simultaneously, which is a claim of irreducible complexity and intelligent design, but that iterations can work given the right sequence.

&gt; The paper is saying that they thought that any of the 120 ways would work. Seriously?

No, that's not what they thought at all. See, this is how science works. You test an idea with REAL examples to show that something happens. What the researchers did was say that all five point mutations were necessary for the new allele, and thus the math works out that there are 120 different ways that these five mutations could happen. But then they showed that not every single mutation or series benefits the organism.

Instead of just claiming something, they went out and showed what works and what doesn't.

Unlike creationists and their claims.

&gt; If we needed 10 or 20 mutations, then it's quite likely that there is no way to go from A to B and protein evolution is a dead end.

See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Creationists just make claims based on what they believe, but they're not willing to test it out and demonstrate that their claims are valid. Here we have a paper showing that there's a very unlikely but beneficial allele, and then they show it is inevitable that it will arise.

&gt; is it the main type of antibiotic resistance that bacteria have, or are there many others?

Nope, it is just one type in one bacterium right now.

In order to square these findings with your conclusion, you need the scientific method itself, not just evolutionary biology, to be invalid. *That's* the problem here. 

A different interpretation is that you are making a big argument from incredulity; a lot of ""I don't really understand this, but I don't buy it.""

Which, fine, but I'm not inclined to take it seriously if you want to argue that the birds weren't actually flightless, or the island wasn't actually flooded. The evidence is what it is, take it or leave it.

&gt;Nowhere is it described what exactly makes these birds flightless. There are a couple of possibilities and none of them require evolution.

And then go on to provide the possibilities:

&gt;There might be a common mutation to rail wings that makes them deformed so that the rails can't fly. On continents, these rails get eaten quickly. On isolated islands, these rails survive and outproduce the flying rails (because they're less likely to get blown out to see in storms?).

*That is convergent evolution*. You just described convergent evolution. 

Or...

&gt;There might be epigenetic factors that allow a variation in wingsize and humerour size depending on the environment. These genes could be turned on by something happening on a small isolated island with no predators. We are just learning about how these epigenetic events affect subsequent generations

t1_fec82s1,MRH2,"I've been looking at the flightless rails. There are also a bunch on other islands [(Inaccessible Island)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcXyoy2UbJU).  Strangely the article doesn't mention these.

Questions: 

1) how do they know that the fossils are from birds that are flightless? It seems that the humerus bone is bigger in flightless birds. Is this enough proof? okay for now. Wait ... the article says that the ONLY bones that they seem to have are two humeri and one distal tarsometatarsus. That's not a whole lot of material to work with. It's too bad that there are no wing bones to show that the birds' wings were small or deformed.  And without this, the authors can only legitimately say ""suggests"" and ""indicative"". However, maybe we'll give them the benefit of the doubt here.

&gt; **characters indicative** of flightlessness (Olson, 1977). The more robust distal end of the tarsometatarsus in the Pleistocene specimen, together with the depth of the shaft proximal to the trochlea also greater than in nominate, **suggests** that Dryolimnas had become more terrestrial and flightless.

2) Were there flying rails on the island? Do we have fossils to show that there were any? I haven't found any references to this.

3) How do they know that there was complete innundation? 

&gt;  inferences made from sea-level high-stands dating back 400 000 years before present (YBP) show that the Aldabra platform was subject to at least one total inundation event around 340 000 YBP, with possibly two others at 240 000 and 200 000 YBP, respectively (Braithwaite et al., 1973; Braithwaite, 1984) (Fig. 3). [...]  An undated limestone depositional sequence (Picard Calcarenites) exposed on present-day Ile Picard must be in excess of 136 000 YBP, as the younger, overlying and island-wide Aldabra Limestone has been dated from Ile Picard deposits between 136 000 (Middle Pleistocene) and 118 000 (Upper Pleistocene) YBP ± 9000 (~127 000+) (Thomson &amp; Walton, 1972; Braithwaite et al., 1973) (Fig. 3), which represents the most recent complete inundation event

So it looks like it's to do with ""sea-level high-stands"". Don't know what those are. And something about limestone and also layers containing reptile fossils. The reptiles would be terrestrial and would only have died on ground that was above sea level.

Oh, this is interesting: 

&gt; The complete inundation of the Aldabra Atoll during deposition of the Aldabra Limestone resulted in the extinction of the endemic Aldabra petrel Pterodroma kurodai Harrison &amp; Walker, 1978, Aldabra duck Aldabranus cabri Harrison &amp; Walker, 1978 and loss of other bird taxa, including the flightless Dryolimnas rail (Harrison &amp; Walker, 1978; Taylor et al., 1979). A number of reptiles also disappeared,

4) on recolonization and development of flightlessness:

&gt;  This, and its presence on Aldabra today, provides irrefutable evidence that Dryolimnas subsequently recolonized Aldabra after inundation and became flightless for a second time. This scenario may seem surprising, but **rails are known to be persistent colonizers of isolated islands and can evolve flightlessness rapidly if suitable conditions exist** (Olson, 1977). Therefore, it is likely that the dispersal of nominate Dryolimnas from Madagascar to remote Aldabra occurred on multiple occasions, 

That's it for the article. There are just a couple of graphs showing the density plots of the humeri of various rails, flighted and flightless, to show that it is indeed likely that the humeri were from flightless birds.

--------------------

##The Problem

Nowhere is it described what exactly makes these birds flightless. There are a couple of possibilities and none of them require evolution. 

1. There might be a common mutation to rail wings that makes them deformed so that the rails can't fly. On continents, these rails get eaten quickly. On isolated islands, these rails survive and outproduce the flying rails (because they're less likely to get blown out to see in storms?).
2. There might be epigenetic factors that allow a variation in wingsize and humerour size depending on the environment. These genes could be turned on by something happening on a small isolated island with no predators. We are just learning about how these epigenetic events affect subsequent generations (https://theanalyticalscientist.com/fields-applications/a-lasting-legacy).

As has been pointed out many many times by various people, **losing** an ability to do something is no proof for evolution. It's de-evolution: starting with a complex well formed organism and breaking pieces of it. It's like a prehistoric tribe encountering an automobile: they can tinker with it and bang it to make it worse, to break features of it, but they certainly can't diagnose and repair it if it's broken, nor can they make it more efficient.

#### So, in conclusion, I see zero evidence for evolution here and zero evidence for convergent evolution or iterative evolution.",1579369277
t1_fesnej2,DarwinZDF42,"&gt; are these 5 mutations ones that can happen consecutively with time in between, or are they ones that must happen simultaneously?

Consecutively with time in between, in fact many generations in between, as the authors explain here:

&gt;To estimate the relative probabilities with which evolution by natural selection for heightened cefotaxime resistance will realize each of the 120 possible mutational trajectories from TEMwt to TEM*, we assumed that the time to fixation or loss of individual mutations is far less than the time between mutations [the ""strong selection/weak mutation"" model of (15)]. Thus, the relative probability of realizing any particular mutational trajectory is the product of the relative probabilities of its constituent mutations, because under our assumption the choice of each subsequent fixation is statistically independent of all previous fixations (12).

All five together confer an extremely high level of resistance. Individually or in combinations of two to four, only some confer resistance at various levels; others (individually or in combination) are neutral or harmful.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The paper is saying that they thought that any of the 120 ways would work. Seriously? I don't believe this. With so many possibilities for harmful mutations, anyone with common sense would think that the number of non-harmful mutations would be really small. 

Okay, first, that's not what they say. The authors write:

&gt;In principle, evolution to this highresistance b-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles.

*In principle*, there *might* be 120 pathways to all five mutations. *In principle*. If you really want to have a discussion, please don't misstate authors' meaning.

More importantly, the problem is that you're assuming each mutation as harmful, neutral, or beneficial in an absolute sense, when that isn't the case. Context matters. 

So like take a look at figure 2. That shows at from the ancestral state (0/5 mutations), only 3 and 5 on their own are beneficial. 1, 2, and 4 are harmful, when they occur on their own. 

But follow the bottom branch - once mutation 5 occurs, mutations 2 and 4 become beneficial. 

This phenomenon is called epistasis. It's when a mutation or allele has some effect on its own, and has a different one in the presence of some other mutation. 

One a mutation has a negative effect, but combined with another has a positive effect, that second mutation that interacts epistatically is called a *compensatory mutation*. These are extremely important in the context of antibiotic resistance. It's very often the case that a resistance allele has a negative effect on fitness, but compensatory mutations partially or fully reverse it. 

So that's one big thing - almost no mutation or allele has a single, constant fitness effect. Epistasis is extremely common.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If we needed 10 or 20 mutations, then it's quite likely that there is no way to go from A to B and protein evolution is a dead end.

Given what I just said above, that's exactly the opposite of what this work shows. 

If everything had a single, constant fitness effect, that would make evolution much harder. Epistasis makes it *way easier* to evolve new things, by vastly expanding the universe of mutations that are potentially a net benefit. So you can have potential mutation A that is bad and potential mutation B that is bad, but together, there're beneficial. That wouldn't be the case without epistasis. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Finally, what the conclusion seems to say is that now that they know how to trace the path from A to B, they can do this for many other situations where we have some cool property that a bacteria has and we can see how it came about (or at least we can determine that it came about in just one of a few paths). I think that it is pretty neat that this sort of antibiotic resistance has been tracked down and investigated (is it the main type of antibiotic resistance that bacteria have, or are there many others?), but I await this sort of thing for a larger number of mutations.

So first, yes, there are a TON of different mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, this is just one of them.

But the point is that yes, if we can determine pathways that we'd expect, we can 1) plan for the development of resistance by targeting specific intermediate genotypes that we expect to appear, and 2) predict what combinations of mutations we expect to see clinically. 

And that second thing is exactly what happened after [a similar study from 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462546/pdf/12750318.pdf) in which two novel resitance alleles were found - one appeared in a hospital a few years later. (Which, while not the point of this discussion, is a pretty cool example of a direct evolutionary prediction confirmed.)",1579368593

I still don't grasp the point of this paper. Not only does it not show anything about evolution to me, let alone convergent or iterative evolution, it's just weird.

First please clarify: are these 5 mutations ones that can happen consecutively with time in between, or are they ones that must happen simultaneously? e.g bacteria has one mutation -- nothing bad happens, it lives and reproduces, and then its offspring has a second mutation, until all 5 lead up to an awesome improvement in being resistant to antibiotics. Correct?

The paper is saying that they thought that any of the 120 ways would work. Seriously? I don't believe this. With so many possibilities for harmful mutations, anyone with common sense would think that the number of non-harmful mutations would be really small. And this is what the paper found.

t1_feplo4h,arcturisvenn,"Yes. The principle this is leading towards is called energy coupling. Some processes are exergonic, meaning they decrease free energy and can occur independently. Some processes are endergonic meaning they increase free energy. These endergonic processes can only reliably occur on their own is they are ""coupled"" to exergonic processes.

Modern organisms have very sophisticated mechanisms of energy coupling. But at the core of those mechanisms is a molecule called ATP. ATP can be converted to ADP (exergonic) or back from ADP to ATP (endergonic) and as such it functions as a sort of rechargeable free energy battery. And the entire cell has evolved to run on this particular battery. In some ways it is a strange state of affairs. You could imagine countless other molecules being just as good (maybe better) yet the entire energy management of life is based around this one molecule called ATP. Its easy to see that modern life has evolved to use ATP as THE direct energy source. But its still reasonable to ask why this molecule of all the possibilities became the direct energy source.

Modern organisms have highly sophisticated mechanisms of energy coupling. Those mechanisms often require significant ""hardware"". The most important pieces of  hardware are proteins, but membranes also play a role as well as specific situational molecules like chlorophyll, NADH, etc..

If I understand your question correctly, you are driving at asking what hardware would be required for energy coupling in the simplest, earliest organisms

We have to keep in mind that the first ""organisms"" were incredibly simple and in all likelihood were simply pieces of RNA. That being the case, there would be no proteins. It is likely that all that you would have to base your energy coupling system upon would be RNA nucleotides. And that RNA nucleotide system would need to be capable of temporarily storing free energy so that you could do two things:

1. Convert them from a low energy state to a high energy state (endergonic) using energy-releasing chemical reactions (exergonic) to provide the energy
2. Convert them from a high energy state back to a low energy state (exergonic) to provide free energy for (endergonic) life processes.

Key Realization: ATP ***is*** exactly this molecule. ATP is an RNA nucleotide, and it converts between high energy (ATP) and low energy (ADP) states, giving you a mechanisms to capture available free energy in the environment and to utilize it. Modern energy coupling ***still to this day*** seems to be based on the sort of mechanism that could have originated in RNA-based first-life.

I want to be scientifically responsible here and acknowledge that we do not fully understand the first organisms, or the exact nature of the earliest metabolism. Our models on the subject will continue to be debated and revised. I have tried to summarize the broad strokes, knowing that the precise details will continue to be debated and revised. We don't have a time machine to get all the data. The point is all the evidence that we *do* have gives us an elegant picture of how the first organisms solved the free energy problem, and even now after billions of years of evolution, we are all still carrying within our biology the remnants (ex. ATP) of those ancestral solutions.",1579352627

t1_fepmctk,DarwinZDF42,"Depends on what they're using and how. 

Initially, it's all spontaneous. When you make a protocell (and you can do this in the lab), they spontaneously acquire a voltage gradient across the lipid bilayer, because that bilayer is impermeable to most ions. That electrical/electrochemical gradient represents a source of potential energy (""potential energy"" in the technical sense, as opposed to ""kinetic energy""). Nothing makes it, it's just a product of the structure of protocells in an aqueous environment. 

That gradient causes other reactions to occur across the membrane, and these reactions are the basis for metabolism. 

So initially it's spontaneous, but if a ribozyme or enzyme forms that facilitates these reactions, or does something coupled with them, then you can start to build off of them. Cells have gone so far they don't use the ""original"" reactions anymore.

He ignores the parallel nature of evolutionary processes, particularly in large microbial populations. So you have trillions of bacteria all mutating in the same environment, and the small fraction that find the correct 1st mutation win, the rest lose. Of the descendants, only those that get the correct 2nd mutations survive, etc. So on until all (in this case) five mutations are present. Behe says this is too improbable to happen.

All you have done is make up baseless nonsense to ignore humanity coming out of Africa and more nonsense to keep believing what you think your holy book says. In a world were humanity came out of Africa and you were trying to deny it to continue believing your version of your religion, this is exactly what you would be doing.

&gt;We never witnessed anything. No mechanism of gene flow resulting in new populations was witnessed.

All the mechanism's of gene flow in question have been observed (unlike what you propose, were all the tests that would show it if it could happen have came up negative) and the only way to have not just the amount of diversity in the African population relative to that of other populations, but also the pattern of it is for them to be the original population the others came from. The alleles of all other human populations are subtypes of alleles of the African population, but these are themselves subtypes of others in the African population. The reverse would be true if Africa was not humanity's place of origin. As I have said, it isn't merely a question of diversity, but the pattern. No natural cause would make one population look identical to what the original population would have looked like. And if you bring up a supernatural cause, you would normally have to have evidence of the supernatural existing. But in your case, your god doing it or even allowing it would be him lying, which your religion believes would be heresy. That would not prevent such a possibility, but it still would require a major contradiction to your religion.

&gt; NO it would not be more diverse elsewhere as not the needs.

You can't even come up with what ""needs"" the African population would have that other wouldn't. And I have mentioned repeatably, there are many places were it would be equally or even more valuable. You are just trying to handwave away all the many problems. You are not looking at the evidence and basing your conclusion on it. You have a baseless conclusion and want to ignore all evidence to the contrary.

&gt;Africans look the least like other peoples slightly.

That is because they have many more variation in their features. Take a smaller population from a larger one, and they will not have all of the features of that population. Unlike the other things you claimed, the African population being the original would not be the only expiation, but it is the only one consistent with the evidence.

&gt;Anyways its all just a line of reason from basic data. Its not scientific evidence and too quickly ignored other options.

The data is pretty definitive. Like it or not, the African genome is exactly what the original human population's genome would look like and no other explanation exists. And other lines of evidence show the exact same thing. So it wasn't accepted "" too quickly"". Your position on the other hand has no evidence in the first place, and a lot against it.",1579333831

t3_eq7yjj,cubist137,"&gt;The very first organisms that we would call life, by what means did they renew energy?
&gt;
&gt;When did life first start to “eat” things? What did they eat at first? When did they start to eat other life forms?

These are good questions. Unfortunately, you're asking about stuff which happened billions of years ago, according to mainstream science, which means it's *seriously* unlikely that we'll *ever* find any actual evidence that's relevant to what you're asking about. Well, maybe if we manage to invent time travel…

Since actual evidence of billions-of-years-old events isn't in the cards, the best we can do is work up *possible* ideas of how this stuff *could have* worked, and then run experiments &amp; make observations to see which of those *possible* ideas even have a chance of being true.

Now, you could argue (as other YECs have done in the past) that any observations we make *in the here and now* cannot be regarded as relevant to stuff that's supposed to have happened *billions of years ago*, cuz how can we be sure that physical laws have stayed the same all this time? Well… maybe we *can't* be *100% absolutely certain* that physical laws have stayed the same. But we can look for indications that things may have been different in the past. Obviously, that does nothing to refute the notion that some sort of omnipotent trickster screwed with the Universe *in such a way that it* ***looks like*** *nothing actually changed*. But if you're going to play *that* card, you may just as well go straight to full solipsism and be done with it.

Assuming you accept the baseline proposition that *physical evidence* ***can*** *tell us something about past events that no one was around to observe in person*, [the first essay on this webpage](http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/aug06.html) provides a nice summary of some of the things scientists *have* looked for which are relevant to the question of determining whether or not physical laws *really are* constant. Spoiler: ""The overall result is that no one has found any evidence of changes in fundamental constants, to an accuracy of about a part in 10^(11) per year.""

So *if* it is indeed possible to learn about past events by examining physical evidence in the present day, *then* we pretty much have to conclude that physical laws *have been constant*. And, in turn, the results of present-day experiments *can* tell us something about the past.",1579327649

t3_eqabhj,Jattok,"**Slide 18** is the title card for the section on The Cambrian Explosion.

**Slide 19** asks, ""Does the fossil record support evolution, or creation?"" Since, again, evolution has all the evidence, and the fossil record hasn't gotten a single fossil that confounds evolution, while creation still has no evidence and nothing scientific about it, I think this goes to evolution again.

**Slide 20** is about ""Fossils"" with the statement included, ""They are considered to be evidence for evolution, showing clear progression from one form to another."" This is a straw man, since no biologist claims that fossils show a clear progression from one form or another. This statement also leans to claiming that evolution is a ladder rather than a really complex web of branching clades.

**Slide 21** asks, ""What would we find if evolution were true?"" With, ""If evolution is true, we would expect to find an ancestral species, which slowly diversified into different species, which became different phyla, which became the animals we know today."" Except that this is not what we expect at all when we understand fossilization. It's extremely rare for the conditions to be right for fossilization to take place. It's even rarer to find anything which did not have anything that would easily fossilize. So early life we will never find mineralized since it was most likely just simple vesicles or very primitive cells. What's more, this statement focuses on animals, neglecting the other various kingdoms of life.

Then, ""The Cambrian was the first geologic period with evidence of large-scale, multicellular organisms. This is where to look first for gradual evolution of types of animals."" No, the Cambrian was just a very long period of time where conditions were ripe for diverse ecological pressures to emerge. Oxygen in the oceans and in the atmosphere increased. More organisms had harder structures that would fossilize easier. During this period, we start to see more fossils of the type of life that existed, but we still find earlier fossils of different life.

**Slide 22** says, ""In the first 30 million years (supposedly the blink of an eye in evolutionary time) of the Cambrian, 80% of animal phyla and 70% of animal classes appear fully formed in the fossil record, with no apparent ancestors."" Which lends itself to the ecological diversity and pressures which enabled new niches to form and variations tailored to those niches to carve new populations out of old ones. As far as having no apparent ancestors, this is completely false. What we don't have are numerous fossils of these ancestors, but we know from other fossil remains that they existed (burrows in deep sediments, etc.).

This slide also claims, ""This is the exact opposite of what we would expect to find if evolution were true."" But no citation given for this, nor is it even remotely true.

The slide finally says, ""This is so far unexplained by evolutionary scientists."" Except I just explained it. Evolutionary scientists can also explain it the same way. So this is just a flat out lie.

**Slide 23** then asks, ""Does the fossil record support evolution?"" And again a bold, large, red ""No!"" appears. Except the fossil record does support evolution quite well.

&gt;Hi r/debateevolution! It's about time I make my own post here. I've been receiving attention, usually negative attention, getting called over from my fortress at r/creation. What else could I expect from you guys when I post things like the 95 thesis against Evolution in my own subreddit completely minding my own business? Nevermind that, I got a few questions for you guys!

&gt;Abiogenesis is yet to be proven either naturally or expirementally. Based on the fossil record you guys interprete as evidence of Evolution of less complex forms to more complex, it can be assumed that as seculars you would find that abiogenesis did occur regardless of what observable science has to say about it right now. Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occuring relies on historical science?

&gt;If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

&gt;Let's say, if abiogenesis did occur naturally, how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

&gt;Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

&gt;Let's say that abiogenesis occured and it got food. How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

&gt;Let's say everything above was answered. Abiogenesis occured, it got it's food, it knew how to make another cell. Now how did this thing get a genome?

&gt;Ok, so it somehow, somewhere, from some place, the genome is now in this cell. Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

&gt;Let's say all problems above are solved. There are problems whatsoever. Now look out your window and see the trees, grass, people, life everywhere. The city, town, rural land around you. Now ask yourself, do you actually believe you came from this thing?

&gt;I hope to get rational answers for my rational questions. You don't always get a Creationist leaving his fortress willing to see what no man's land has in store for him.",1579324464

Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain delivered more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

Metabolism is older than cells, does not require one, it's just chemistry. There is only one product from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by living things that are made of the other.

t3_eqabhj,Jattok,"**Slide 7** is a title card for the section ""Genetic Entropy."" Genetic entropy is just a made up term from John Sanford that is not based on any reality.

**Slide 8** asks ""Does genetics support evolution, or creation?"" Since genetics fully supports evolution and creation is just religious beliefs, it would be reasonable to say that genetics supports evolution and not creation.

**Slide 9** plays up who John Sanford is, then overlays the text ""To understand genetic entropy, first you have to understand DNA, proteins, and mutations."" It's too bad that the person who coined the term doesn't seem to understand genetic entropy other than inventing ways to force it to happen in bad simulations rather than base it on any ""observational science.""

**Slide 10** is just explaining that DNA encodes proteins through a chain of amino acids. Very simplistic and crude explanation, but it is good enough for this slide set.

**Slide 11** argues that ""Proteins do everything in your body..."" ""From maintaining the structure of your eyes, and keeping them clear..."" ""To generating the energy that powers your cells."" This is simply not true, since proteins only do most of the work within your body.

**Slide 12** is about mutations, which is also again only partially true. ""Mutations are changes in DNA, that can cause no change in protein shape and function, or can affect them either deleteriously or beneficially."" There's also the chance that a protein shape can change but also be neither deleterious nor beneficial. The diagram also shows that a mutation may cause an abnormal protein or no protein. It also can cause a normal protein since the mutation did not change the amino acid chain, or the protein fold did not change.

**Slide 13** is titled ""The 3 types of mutations"" and says ""If bad, deleterious mutations are much more common than beneficial mutations, then how could evolution turn microbes into microbiologists?"" Because mutations are not the only factor in pushing forward evolutionary changes. Selection also determines which mutations propagate through populations to future generations.

This slide also gives ratios for the three types of mutations without citing a source nor explaining which genome these ratios are for. It also has impossible math included.

Neutral mutations are at 1/1. Deleterious are at 1/5000. And beneficial are at 1/100000.

**Slide 14** is titled ""Natural selection: evolution’s savior?"" and argues: ""However, natural selection can only prevent the largest deleterious mutations from accumulating."" This makes no sense in any observation of the real world. Natural selection selects out those traits which inhibit the passing on of those traits, regardless of how deleterious they are.

This slide continues, ""This means that the slightly deleterious mutations can keep building up in a species’ genome, preventing it from evolving into a more beneficial form…"" This again makes no sense, as species don't evolve into more beneficial forms regardless of their mutations, but evolve when the ratio of their variations change over generations. Populations then can accumulate any type of variation separate from other populations of the same species until the populations diverge from each other, creating new species. Neither one needs to develop into a more beneficial form to do this, just accumulate changes.

**Slide 15** is supposed to show a visual demonstration of genetic entropy, but it also admits that it's not a valid demonstration because it's sped up. What's more, it doesn't show beneficial mutations and their rates, nor ecological changes, nor anything else which real world demonstrations would need to account for. The entire argument is based on only partially utilizing facts and ignoring those which render the entire argument moot.

**Slide 16** asks, ""If mutations are consistently degenerating the genome, and natural selection does not help, then how could bacteria ever evolve into people?"" Mutations aren't consistently degenerating the genome, and natural selection does help to rid populations of those mutations which do not work as well to produce viable offspring, therefore this is a non-starter.

**Slide 17** then asks, ""Does genetics support evolution?"" and moves to put a giant red ""NO!"" across the slide. Unfortunately, the entire argument in this section is based on an inane idea that has no real-world observations to support it, and therefore the conclusion can't be reached logically from the claims put forth.",1579314798

t3_eq7yjj,Krumtralla,"So, it takes quite a lot of learning about biochemistry before you start to develop a good understanding of metabolism and... I'm not there yet. However, one thing you do learn early on is that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. And what that means is that mitochondria make ATP molecules and this ATP is used to power a lot of other metabolic reactions.

ATP synthesis is ultimately powered by a hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane. Hydrogen ions want to flow from high concentration to low concentration and there's a molecular machine embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. This machine acts like a water wheel, utilizing the pressure of hydrogen ions flowing through it to create ATP molecules. These hydrogen ions are later pumped back outside by a complex of other molecular machines that are powered by the food we eat, basically byproducts of breaking down glucose in our food. Here are a couple great videos about this:

https://youtu.be/3y1dO4nNaKY

https://youtu.be/kXpzp4RDGJI

https://youtu.be/LQmTKxI4Wn4

This can be a bit complex, but bear with me. In modern cells this hydrogen ion gradient is maintained by a bunch of molecular machines powered by sugar metabolism, but what if earlier life forms didn't need them? What if they happened to live in a location where there was a naturally occurring gradient of hydrogen ions? What if gradients of other ions could also power metabolic processes? This is exactly the situation you find around hydrothermal vents in the ocean. Volcanic activity naturally releases a broad mix of different chemicals into the ocean that creates a gradient of high concentration closer to the vent and lower concentration further away. Many life forms today utilize these chemical gradients to sustain themselves.

https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Chemotrophy_Along_Seafloor_Hydrothermal_Vents

You could almost imagine the conditions created by the mitochondria in your cells today are sort of replicating an idealized version of the chemistry that may have occurred near hydrothermal vents billions of years ago.",1579312163
t3_eq7yjj,DarwinZDF42,"The earliest cellular life was probably chemoheterotrophs, which means they got energy from whatever organic molecules were around. 

But the reactions that provided energy to earlier structures, called proto-cells, spontaneously occured based on the structure of proto-cells and the environmental conditions. For example electron gradients can spontaneously form across lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers can spontaneously form from free lipids in water. Lipids can form in aqueous solutions under realistic prebiotic conditions. 

So the first cells got their energy from organic molecules in the environment, but the reactions that provided energy to early cells and earlier cell-like things existed before cells.",1579309151
t3_eq7yjj,arcturisvenn,"A few critical points:

1. No organisms ""renew"" energy. Ever. Its a thermodynamics problem that stems from the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As organisms use energy to perform work, that energy becomes progressively less usable (the ""free energy"" of the system decrease). Interestingly, there is no way to ever get that energy back into a more usable state. The technical  way to say it is that the free energy of a closed system always decreases over time. That leads me to...
2. Living systems harness useful energy like sunlight, utilize it, and then release that energy in a less usable form (typically heat).
3. Since energy flows (flows in, gets used, flows out) and never gets recycled, the persistence of life requires a constant inflow of energy. Today the sun is responsible for the constant inflow of energy required to sustain life. This principle of flowing energy works at all levels of biological organization. Whether we look at a single cell, a single organism, or the entire earth as a single ecosystem, we see the same pattern. Inflow of energy allows for the energy-demanding processes we call life. If you take away the energy source, the living system gradually degrades, losing its organization and structure (again, second law of thermodynamics)
4. Thus the real question we should be asking is ""What energy source provided the inflow of energy for the first organisms?"". Hypothetical answers might include sunlight, electricity (lightning), or intense thermal energy (Deep Ocean Vent hypotheses).  Its a fair question and once for scientific debate. But as you can see there are no shortage of potential answers.
5. The first organisms were autotrophic (got their energy from the nonliving environment). But they were probably not photoautotrophic (getting their energy from light in their environment). Most likely they were chemoautotrophs (getting their energy from energy-releasing chemical reactions in their environment). There are still chemoautotrophs in existence today.
6. Organisms that rely on ""eating"" other organisms to get their energy evolved later. Eating another organism is a tremendously effective way to get a lot of energy at once.",1579307226

Many forms of life don't consume other forms of life for their resources, but are autotrophic: much as plants use light, many species use sulfur or nitrate metabolism to generate their energy from chemical sources. That said, the strategy of consuming other forms of life likely arose quite quickly, as game theory suggests it is a rather obvious method of getting ahead.",1579303123

&amp;#x200B;

To help get this discussion back on track, here's a summary of my position.  I'm using quotes so it's obvious exactly where my position starts/stops, it's not actually a quote of something I said before, though a good part of it should sound quite similar:

""

Conclusion:  If giraffes or their recent ancestors were ""designed"" by an ""intelligent designer"" in any fashion, then the recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes is poor design.

Supporting argument:

1. Definition:  ""fitness of an organism"" == the organism's ability to produce viable offspring.
2. Definition:  ""reaction time"" == the total time it takes an organism to sense external stimuli, process it, and physically respond to it.  Total reaction time is the sum of the following:  the time it takes for nerve stimuli to travel from the sensory organ(s) which received the external stimuli to wherever it will be processed (usually the brain);  the time it takes to process that information (usually in the brain, sometimes elsewhere) and start sending a nerve impulse to the muscles;  and the time it takes the nerve impulse to travel from the brain (or other origin) to the appropriate muscle(s) where the physical response takes place.
3. Efficient use of resources is generally (though not always) important to the fitness of organisms.  E.g., plants which don't optimize their ability to absorb nutrients (light, minerals, water) are less able to take in nutrients;  predators which attack the stronger prey animals instead of the weaker ones have a smaller chance of taking in nutrients.  Organisms which don't use their resources efficiently tend to have fewer offspring, leading to their genes dwindling from the population over many generations.
4. Prompt reaction time to stimuli is generally (though not always) important to the fitness of organisms.  E.g., the time it takes for a driver to slam on the brakes when stimuli (sights, sounds) indicate they will crash into the car in front of them;  and the time it takes for a giraffe to bleat and warn its family when stimuli indicate a predator nearby.  Organisms which don't react quickly enough to stimuli tend to have fewer offspring, leading to their genes dwindling from the population over many generations.
5. Increasing the length of a given nerve increases the 3rd component of ""reaction time"" as described above -- the time it takes the nerve impulse to travel from the brain (or other origin) to the appropriate muscle(s).Nerves transmit electrical impulses at a fixed rate.  The rate varies based on the type of the nerve, but it is essentially constant for any given nerve of a given type.  Therefore, keeping all other things constant, a longer nerve will result in an increased reaction time, because impulses take longer to travel the length of the nerve.
6. Increasing the length of a given nerve also increases the resources consumed by growing and maintaining that nerve.
7. Changing other properties of the nerve to make it transmit impulses faster will necessarily consume resources.  So, even if a longer nerve can still support an acceptable reaction time when it's thickened, myelinated, etc., these changes consume more resources than if the nerve wasn't thickened, myelinated, etc.
8. From 5 &amp; 6, any increase in nerve length (holding everything else constant) will always increase reaction time, and should always increase usage of resources.  Therefore the organism with a longer nerve has used resources less efficiently AND has a longer reaction time compared to another organism with a shorter nerve that serves the same function.  The organism with the longer nerve is therefore less fit.
9. From 6 &amp; 7, if the transmission rate of a lengthened nerve is improved to avoid increasing the reaction time, then resources must again be spent.  Therefore the organism with the longer, faster nerve has used resources even less efficiently compared to another organism with a shorter nerve -- first, to support a longer nerve, and then again to support thickening, myelination, etc. to improve the speed of that nerve.  The organism with the longer, faster nerve is therefore less fit.
10. Any ""good design"" should optimize fitness of an organism, given the ecological niche it's ""designed"" to live in.  Therefore, there is no way for a longer nerve to be considered ""good design"" when a shorter one would do.
11. The recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes could be shorter and still serve all the same functions -- it only needs to be routed differently.  Therefore if it is ""designed"", it is an example of poor design.  Q.E.D.

""

I agree that my definition of ""fitness"" (and my implicit definition of ""good design"") are arguable.  If you object to those, then we can talk about refining them.

Do you object to this argument?  If so, what parts, and what's your counterargument?",1579298169
t3_epqwuk,Denisova,There are some creationists engaging here in this thread. As expected they discuss everything they can lay their hands on *except* for the OP's questions. Now why would that be...,1579297813
t1_felccfv,Denisova,"You 'forget' to quote the very next things Wise wrote. Here's the full citation (italics mine):

&gt;  Although there are scientific reasons for accepting a young earth, I am a young-age creationist because that is my understanding of the Scripture. As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turns against creationism, *I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate. Here I must stand*.

Wise also wrote in his personal testimony ""In Six Days"" that when he earned his Ph.D. from Harvard, became increasingly uneasy as his scientific learning conflicted with his religious faith. When he could bear the strain no longer, he said he clinched the matter with a Bible and a pair of scissors. He went right through from Genesis 1 to Revelations 22, literally cutting out every verse that would have to go if the scientific observations he learned were true. At the end of this exercise, there was so little left of his Bible that, as he testifies:

&gt; . . . try as I might, and even with the benefit of intact margins throughout the pages of Scripture, I found it impossible to pick up the Bible without it being rent in two. I had to make a decision between evolution and Scripture. Either the Scripture was true and evolution was wrong or evolution was true and I must toss out the Bible. . . . It was there that night that I accepted the Word of God and rejected all that would ever counter it, including evolution. With that, in great sorrow, I tossed into the fire all my dreams and hopes in science.

YEC is at colission course with modern science, at it s core. You have Kurt Wise, one of the extremely rare YECs that actually earned a Ph.D. in a relevant scientific discipline, explaining that to you.",1579297583
t3_epvcuz,Sweary_Biochemist,"I've said it before: creationists demand far, far more uniformitarian conditions than actual scientists. Almost all of their 'data' is based on cherry picking rates they like (i.e. ones that they can extrapolate back to \~6000 years ago) and then assuming those rates have never changed, even though quite often they've changed substantially even in living memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider: flood geology (while admittedly demanding a massive and physics-defying world-flood accompanied by enough accelerated radioactive decay and geological movement to turn the earth into an incandescent sphere of plasma-steam flickering with cherenkov radiation occupied by one zoo boat) states that only one catastrophic event has ever happened, and that since then things have proceeded at uniform (unrealistic) rates.

They just seem to think the earth suddenly looked more or less like it does today, and then eroded (slightly).

Meanwhile actual reality suggests the earth has experienced multiple catastrophic events over the course of its long existence, from meteor strikes to ice ages to atmospheric crises to massive vulcanism, and so on. Mass extinctions abound, and no scientist is attempting to hide the fact that mass extinctions abound. Perhaps they're confused that because physics indicates radioactive decay rates (and lord knows they have enough trouble with those) have not changed and indeed *cannot* really change, science automatically claims all measurable processes cannot change?

t1_fej5tqw,Denisova,"&gt; There is not a single verifiable example of macro evolution.

The fossil record is showing macroevolution on an epic scale. Simply: as you can observe in the Grand Canyon, the geological column consists of thousands of layers, compartmentalized into dozens of formations. Each formation is different in rock types, morphology, mineralogy and fossil record. First of all, this tells that each subsequent layers has its own history and origin. Secondly, we observe that each formation has its own distinct fossil record. That is. formation A contains fossils that are nowhere found in any other formation. Formation A+1, sitting on top of formation A, also contains its very own fossil record. Let call these ""species(A+1)"". The species(A+1) are not found in formation A or any other formation sitting beneath A. Tehy pop up for the first time in formation A+1. 

Which implies that the biodiversity differs greatly between the subsequent geological layers. By sheer logic formation A is older than formation A+1. For instance, formation A may represent a former sea floor (recognizable by the fish and other marine fossils). A sea floor can't be formed when sitting under another formation.

Which on its turn implies that biodiversity changed greatly throughout the geological history of the world.

Such stratification of subsequent geological layers and formations and the linked change in biodiversity is what we observe verywhre you excavate geological layers around the globe.

Moreover, we also observe many instances of mass extinction events in the fossil reord - instance when major perts of the biodiversity collapsed. These are quite easy to spot: you have a geological layer A teaming with lifeforms but a layer A+1 sitting on top of it where most of these species and taxa are gone. Also we observe in consequent higher-ground layers that life always recovered. But it recovers with whole new species and taxa of lifeforms that are nowhere seen in any lower formation. The species and taxa that still were present in layer A are gone forever.

The foossil record is an epic showcase of macroevolution.",1579296035

t1_fenmrd2,DavidTMarks,"Alright one last response since I refreshed and saw your response.  Everything you wrote is just denial and rhetoric. You are  mostly an atheist community  as judged by the posts of your active posters. Fact. You can see you collectively  badgering and routinely calling the few  creationist here  liars in some  shape or form, Ignorant in some way and often taking general swipes at their religion that have nothing to do with evolution. Most of you  are even antidesign and at least two of your mods  have indirect conversations with me implied evolution equals antidesign which is UTTERLY false .

Get over it. Its a fact . No need for the  dishonesty because it doesn't work. You ARE chiefly  an atheist community. Thats why even though my views are more inline with theistic evolutionists than YEC you'll find me  posting my distaste for the farce of this sub 

&gt;The same could be said of your claim. A flat Earther who has had their claims demolished could just call everyone a meany and use that as an excuse to run away.

no equivalence.   Anyone that runs away doesn't have the  opportunity to then hang around and  try and control the narrative of why they ran away.  Thats what you do.  

Flat Earthers raises a great  point  - for my perspective.   I'd never start a debate or  start a sub with debating flat earth because it has nothing to me debatable from top to bottom.
  
Rational people don't sit around each week debating whats not, in their minds, debatable - which is why  when several of your friends admit theres no debate  on the subject here - continuing to talk to themselves as if there is a real debate is irrational and forever farcical .

No rhetoric or denial changes that",1579290124
t1_fenh250,Covert_Cuttlefish,"&gt;Ah so it was necessary to pretend its a debate site to do so I guess?


I agree that this sub is poorly named. Something along the lines of debunking creationist myths for people brought up in fundamentalist households would be more accurate.

&gt;That wasn't your error. It was assuming things never stated.

Sure, I made an assumption, I have no problem admitting that.

&gt;Trust me not as funny as the rhetoric of assuming everyone that disagrees with you who you don't even know their positions automatically has to "" prove the scientific community wrong"". 

Nearly every time someone here complains about being treated unfairly it was not their person that was treated unfairly, only their ideas about evolution.

Please, if you really believe that I have a bridge to sell you.  What they mean when they say ""couldn't behave themselves"" they meant ""kept challenging our claims"".

If this issue were unique to this sub, or even reddit, then you might have a point.  But it isn't, creationists do this all over the world.  They don't participate in the normal scientific process.  They do (or at least claim to do) their research in secret.  This is a consistent problem anywhere that creationists might have their claims challenged in any detail.

&gt; Credibly thats your fault because atheist in Theist communities have a well known and established way of behaving badly (cursing, attacking, belittling other viewpoints, snark etc

Luckily this isn't an ""atheist community"".  That is a strawman creationists like to use, but it is simply factually incorrect.

&gt; If I can't enter a r/catholic thread to ask a catholic a question I don't go to r/protestants to ask them a question for catholics.

This is a great strawman.  The problem here isn't that this is the wrong sub, it isn't.  This sub is exactly the right one for this sort of thing.  The problem, rather, is that creationists refuse to participate in an open discussion on their claims.  And again, that isn't a problem unique to reddit.

&gt; Like I said before thats the beauty of running people off. When they are gone you can always say the real reason is they couldn't take good reason.

t1_fen80cr,Sweary_Biochemist,"Creationists (and indeed...whatever you are) are welcome to contribute, but should expect to have their views challenged. Typically those who follow a science-based approach (and indeed, reality-based) are not averse to having their views challenged: after all, science thrives on challenging (and indeed changing) existing dogma.

Conversely, creationists tend to be less keen on having their views challenged, for...possibly a variety of reasons. 

They might not be scientifically literate enough to be comfortable responding to specific scientific challenges to YEC postulates (the discovery institute, for instance, pumps out a lot of stuff that *sounds* sciencey to the lay person, but which is actually horseshit, so lay people who have taken it as science may well be ill-equipped to handle the criticisms levelled at it). 

They might not want to have their views challenged because their position is faith-based, and to accept that such a position is *wrong* necessitates a long, hard look at all the other views they've pegged to that same faith.

Some might be vocal proponents of creationism, but entirely unable to address the flaws in their position, or unwilling to admit that they are fully aware of those flaws. These individuals typically persist until they realise their position is obviously indefensible, then find a spurious reason to take offense and disengage entirely.

For all these reasons and more, r/creation is a members-only, 'please don't try to tell us anything we don't like to hear' chamber, while this place is more of a 'happy to have our views challenged, so by all means have a go if you think you can back it up'.

At the simplest, creationism does *not* thrive on challenging dogma: it *is* dogma. The position is that a literal interpretation of the bible is correct, and anything that invalidates this position must thus be wrong.

That doesn't mean creationism speaks for all creationists.The central worldview brooks no argument, but individuals might have doubts. This is one place they can address those doubts and, possibly, find a way to reconcile actual reality with biblical faith. Most scientists are not atheists, so this is clearly not an insurmountable obstacle.",1579280599

&amp;nbsp;
I understand that you might not see much of what is posted in this sub-redd. I erroneously thought you were referring to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/encq7l/lets_break_something_part_2/fegk06s/) and [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/encq7l/lets_break_something_part_2/felh2z2/) where I made ***beginning*** in establishing what ***could*** be meant by ""random process"" in the context of the ToBE.

&amp;nbsp;
When I mentioned the software naming convention, I merely explained to you--by way of my former profession--the reason I became interested in the rejected naming convention proposal. In the posts of mine I reference above, I pose, at the end, the following question (ME): *""Now, we've come to the point to ask, what ***exactly*** is the meaning of 'random' in the term 'random process' in the context of the ToBE? In the context of number selection from infinite sets of numbers, we've seen that it is impossible.""* I hope you appreciate that I ***know*** that our subject ""isn't computer programing, it's biology."" (You) What I DON'T KNOW about the naming convention **issue** that you mentioned is whether the proponents have a *noteworthy, valuable,* ***important*** idea that is NOT ""meh""-worthy. My experience has trained me NOT to trust the true-believers of the ToBE. I consider you to be one. No offense, I hope.",1579280003

t1_fej1pzg,andrewjoslin,"Yes.  I brought it up for that reason.

You:

&gt; You may or may not have read one of my posts in which I claim to know the meaning of ""random"" from being required to ***create*** actual, factual sets of random numbers as part of college-level assignments for software language courses. 

Anybody reading that would reasonably assume that you either made a mistake and meant to type ""pseudorandom"" instead of ""random"", or that you don't know the difference.  For somebody trying to quiz me on randomness as a lame excuse for not wanting to deal directly with the content of my post, the first option is excusable while the second is downright awful.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's talk about pseudorandom numbers now, using quotes from your previous comment...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the size of the largest number for an operating system is conveyed in what we, today, commonly see in the ""n-bit"" specification, as in ""32-bit"", ""64-bit,"" this being the largest memory address capable of being generated and the largest number capable of being generated and, hence, used in calculations 

This is irrelevant to why computers can't generate truly random numbers without external input.  Without external input, a computer can't even generate a random bit sequence -- it'll be pseudorandom, even if it's infinitely long.  Knowing the seed and algorithm used to generate each term of the sequence would allow anybody, anywhere, at any time to compute the same exact sequence.  This is why computers generate pseudorandom numbers, and it has nothing to do with word length (32- vs 64-bit).

&gt; Further, there is a ***decimal precision*** contraint on computer-generated decimals: a Mathematical definition requires an infinite decimal precision. 

This is also irrelevant.  As we discussed in another thread, when a computer represents a number or string it's actually storing that information as bits in its memory.  As such, floating point precision does not constrain computers' ability to generate random numbers, because the computer is generating and storing random *bits*, not a random *decimal number*.  When we analyze a computer's ability (or inability) to generate truly random numbers, we must ignore the decimal number representation we see on the screen, and only think about the underlying bit sequence the computer is actually using.

When you think of it that way, whenever a computer generates a pseudorandom number it is simply generating a pseudorandom sequence of bits.  No decimal places, no exponents / mantissas, just a sequence of bits.  Sure, the length of the sequence matters, but as I said above we can have a bit sequence of any length, regardless of word size.  Therefore, floating point precision doesn't matter at all here -- what matters (same as above) is the fact that if we know the seed and algorithm used to generate the sequence, then it can be reproduced by anybody, anywhere, at any time.  This is why computers generate pseudorandom numbers, and it has nothing to do with floating point (or decimal) precision.

It's all because computers are deterministic, so they are incapable of producing truly random results without external input, regardless of word length or floating point precision.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a relatively low-level explanation of what I've said, hosted on MIT's website.  There are probably some Comp. Sci. theorems backing this up, but you can find that as well as I can:   [https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/can-a-computer-generate-a-truly-random-number/](https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/can-a-computer-generate-a-truly-random-number/)",1579279313

t1_fem2eb0,CHzilla117,"&gt;Only genetics and not fossils etc.

When two separate lines if evidence give the exact same conclusion, that is significant.

&gt;you say Africa has more dNA diversity and thus seyttles as the original human placeorigin.

It is the pattern of that diversity compared to all other populations. That pattern is identical to what would happen if all other populations branched off from the African population and then branched out further as they spread out. As as mentioned above, fossil evidence says the exact same thing.

&gt;Yet people moving into africa, needing to change DNA for important reasons, would also accomplish this result.

You are still asserting DNA can do something without evidence, something that as I previously mentioned you falsely claimed in a previous thread science was doing about evolution, even though the all the mechanisms of evolution have been observed. You are also still not given an explanation for why no other population has done it.

&gt;YOU are denying the dna could change quick enoug. yet thats another point. your just saying it couldn't because its not seen to happen today.

First, I am saying that not only is there no mechanism in the human genome  to increase the mutation rate, but also that one high enough to account for the diversity of the African population in so short a time would lead to a fatal amount of negative mutations.

&gt;Nothing in Dna is witnessed. its only presumed by existing rates/measurements. Yet i science measurement of accuracy must include imagination .

Science isn't just making things up that suit you. Lets recap. You are saying a population used a mechanism that has never been observed and no population, even those in much worse conditions, has never used for some reason, and which would lead to the population being non-viable if done at the rate you need, and it happened in such a way that it ended up looking exactly like what one would except the original human population to look like.

On the other hand, the African population looks exactly like what one would expect the original human population to like look compared to the rest of the human population, fossil evidence shows the same thing, and no unknown mechanisms need to be made up in this expiation.

t1_felezcl,ursisterstoy,"Isn’t it ironic to you that creation science puts out ideas that contradict the findings in every field of science and they even contradict themselves often? 

If we were to throw away all Christian Science literature, all scripture, all philosophy, and even the principles of logic how would you get from total ignorance to understanding how everything actually works? Would you work towards developing some principles of logic, some basic statements about your observations and a method for discrediting false idea or would you base your understanding on what other people say, dreams, and hallucinations? What if these other people say there is this being you can’t see but this being told them the real truth even if it contradicts what you observe? 

From a position of total ignorance without an epistemology would you start with faith first or scientific objectivity to understand this reality you perceive with every waking moment? 

The disagreement here seems to come from epistemology such that you act like a book written a couple thousand years ago holds more truth than what we can directly observe or discover via forensic investigation. I know that the main argument against science tends to be one that isolates what we can see happening right now from what happened in the past while also considering how specific the fundamental constants of reality have to be for our existence. If these constants were different in the past how can we test for that without the Bible or any other religious literature? For instance, if radiometric decay was faster in the past yet didn’t completely destroy all the surrounding matter how would we be able tell? How can we see objects of a distance 13.8 billion light years away if the measurable speed of light is too slow for us to detect anything that far away in a shorter amount of time? Are these objects closer than we think they are? How are we not constantly burning with all of these stars so close to us? If they are as far away as we say they are how did the speed of causality allow photons to travel through the universe at such high speeds without traveling backwards in time or burning a hole right through our planet? 

Perhaps you accept the age of the Earth and the universe to account for these problems. How do you explain the emergence of new life forms coinciding with the extinction of old ones if life was supposed to all be created at the same time? 

My point here is that every testable claim of creationism doesn’t hold up to even the slightest amount of scrutiny though a creator god capable of creating a universe with incantations and humans with a golem spell could conceivably alter our reality without us knowing so that we wouldn’t know the difference between being born more than three decades ago and being created as adults last week with all the memories of existing since before that. In either case we are talking about taking the Bible literally because the Bible claims to be true and because of theological reasons like Jesus being able to provide a way to heaven written into the story as though he believed the creation story to be a literal historical event. What about the firmament created on the second day? Why is this metaphor but the six day creation it is found within is not? Were humans created male and female after all the other animals perhaps as seven complete pairs of humans or was Adam made alone before the animals that he got a acquainted with and named before being unable to find a suitable partner among them so one of his bones containing the XY chromosome condition was transformed into a XX female?

I disagree, in the sense that there is a very real difference between what they study and how they operate. 

From my research on this it seems like ""operational sciences"" tend to work on shorter time scales, focus on a single hypothesis at a time, and are concerned with regularities and patterns. Historical sciences in contrast tend to work on larger timescales, generally work with natural experiments (as opposed to controlled experiments), and has a greater focus on singular events. Historical science does make testable predictions, but there is generally more wiggle room for error in the ""background knowledge"" used to derive those predictions. We're still doing a test when we test those predictions, of course, but the test is going to carry less ""punch"" against our target hypothesis because there's a higher likelihood the error lies in one of our background hypothesis. The upshot of this is when we have more room for false negatives, and we **still** get it right (even though the odds are stacked against us), that's a pretty solid indicator we're basically correct.

&amp;nbsp;

Now to the OP:

&gt;Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occurring relies on historical science?

This historical/observation stuff is a false distinction. We can test ideas about what happened in the past as readily as we can test ideas about ongoing processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

It isn't really a question - the atmosphere has low atomic oxygen (O2) until the oxygen revolution. 

The oceans would also have had very low dissolved oxygen during that time. 

Atmospheric O2 is generated by oxidative photosynthesis, the process responsible for the oxygen revolution. 

I don't see the problem. Ozone isn't relevant - stuff can survive without it, it just happens to be helpful to hairless, terrestrial, surface-dwellers like humans. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

Organic solutes, macromolecules, and other organisms. Proto-cells will ""eat"" each other - some internal conditions make them more likely to assimilate nearby protocells. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

It didn't. Modern forms of metabolism didn't exist yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

Protocells can grow and divide spontaneously. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Now how did this thing get a genome?

Spontaneously assembled small RNA molecules with biochemical activity (these are called ribozymes).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

Possibly. But one of the other billions will be fine.

I didn't give detailed answers because I am not a question, and these questions are not about evolution, but about abiogenesis. I do not claim to be an expert on abiogenesis, but I know enough to give broad answers. 

But as I already pointed out, the fact that I may not be able to answer to your satisfaction doesn't mean that no one can, and if no one can it doesn't mean that no one will ever be able to. That is exactly why this entire line of questioning s fallacious. 

&gt; I'm only asking questions. 

[Just asking questions](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions) is often a form of a fallacious argument.  

It seems to me that you are trying to play gotcha games... If I can't answer any of your questions to your absolute satisfaction, you declare victory. But that is not how it works. 

&gt; You didn't have to be agressive about it.

That was not aggressive. It was a sincere response. 

Pointing out that an argument is fallacious is not hostile. We all use fallacious reasoning occasionally. If you sincerely want to have a sound basis for your beliefs you should not be offended when people point out you are making a fallacy. You should take their point as an opportunity to strengthen your reasoning. 

**The problem with fallacious reasoning is that it's not based on a sound foundation. Without a sound foundation, you cannot conclude whether the reasoning is actually correct or not. You might be correct, but if so, it is a coincidence, nothing more. Fallacious reasoning *by its very nature* cannot *lead* you to a correct conclusion. If you are right, it is just that you conclusively believed what was correct.** 

For example, it wasn't that long ago that it was *obvious* that the earth was flat and the sun orbited the earth, which was at the center of the universe. In both of these cases, the plain evidence *absolutely* supports the stated conclusion. It's perfectly understandable why someone would say ""I just can't believe the earth is a sphere"" or ""I just can't believe that the earth is just one of billions of planets in the universe."" Yet we now know that both of those statements are wrong. 

By the same token, anyone in ancient Greece who said ""I can't believe we are the only planet in the universe. There must be planets around other stars!"" is equally fallacious. They are correct, but the reasoning that they used to get there was faulty. ""I can't believe"" is never a sound foundation to rest claims of knowledge on. 

The fact that something *seems* improbable has no bearing on whether it is *true*. The time to believe something is when you have evidence that it is true. Right now the evidence for abiogenesis is weak, but not non-existent. As such I do accept it as *probably* true, but I do not claim any sort of certainty.",1579232417

&gt; Evolution of less complex forms to more complex

This is not necessarily how Evolution works. Evolution is about the change in populations over time. Complexity can potentially either increase or decrease, but it does tend to increase as previous body structures are typically not discarded, but are built upon.

&gt; historical science

If a man is killed, and no one saw him killed, are attempts to comprehend how he was killed by observations of the evidence at the crime scene 'historical science'? And if so, are they somehow inherently flawed? Should we ditch the field of forensics?

If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

The first life did not rely on oxygen to metabolize. We still have anaerobic bacteria today, which do not require oxygen. This is a good page to start for that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event

&gt; How did it know

The organisms didn't know anything. They didn't have brains. Forms that arose either died off because they were not able to find food, metabolize it, and reproduce, or they did those things and their genetic legacy lived on. None of them made decisions about this.

&gt; Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

Negative mutations are naturally selected against, because the organisms that get them die off before reproducing. Meanwhile positive mutations cause the organism to be able to reproduce more often.

In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

Metabolism is older than cells, does not require one, it's just chemistry. There is only one product from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by living things that are made of the other.

&gt;1. Abiogenesis is yet to be proven either naturally or expirementally. Based on the fossil record you guys interprete as evidence of Evolution of less complex forms to more complex, it can be assumed that as seculars you would find that abiogenesis did occur regardless of what observable science has to say about it right now. Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occuring relies on historical science?

This is really two issues, so I will address both.

It is true that abiogenesis has not been proven, yet neither has a god. I do not claim certainty that abiogenesis is how life arose, but I do believe that it is the most likely explanation given the available evidence. We do know that broadly similar chemical reactions happen, so while we have never recreated the specific reactions that lead to life, it is at least plausible that such a reaction could happen. We don't even know if it is plausible that a god can exist. 

Creationists like to dismiss ""historical science"" as if it has no validity or evidential value at all. That is dishonest. 

It is a valid to point out that what you call ""historical science"" is *less* reliable. As such, any given piece of evidence provides a *lower* evidentiary value. You need more total evidence to conclude that the hypothesis you are arguing for is true, but in the case of evolution, the amount of evidence is overwhelming. 

&gt; 2. If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

This seems to be assuming that primordial life is just the same as modern life, which was not necessarily the case. 

&gt; 3. Let's say, if abiogenesis did occur naturally, how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

The simplest microbes don't eat ""food"" as we think of it. but they digest chemicals in the environment. Similar organisms continue to exist today.

&gt; 4. Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

No clue. But the fact that I have no clue doesn't mean no one does, and even if no one does, that doesn't mean we never will. 

&gt; 5. Let's say that abiogenesis occured and it got food. How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

Self replication is literally the most fundamental part of anything being described as ""life"". the result of abiogenesis by definition can self replicate. 

&gt; 6. Let's say everything above was answered. Abiogenesis occured, it got it's food, it knew how to make another cell. Now how did this thing get a genome?

This is basically just rewording the last question. If it doesn't have some way to define what it is, it can't possibly replicate, can it?

&gt; 7. Ok, so it somehow, somewhere, from some place, the genome is now in this cell. Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

Only if the reproductive cycle didn't have some way to limit negative mutations. Fortunately natural selection does exactly that. 

&gt; 8. Let's say all problems above are solved. There are problems whatsoever. Now look out your window and see the trees, grass, people, life everywhere. The city, town, rural land around you. Now ask yourself, do you actually believe you came from this thing?

No such thing.

See, this is what is so ridiculous about the creationist ideas of how the Earth formed/changed. If humans were around for such an event, they would be dead. The amount of energy it takes to reshape ground or push water through the crust is enormous, and that energy also generates heat. Everything would be fried.

In [that post above](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/encq7l/lets_break_something_part_2/fegk06s/), I began a discussion of that essential and most elusive tenet of the ToBE, the meaning of ""random."" I did so as I was challenged *appropriately* on my use of ""random"" in the college homework assignment ([postlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/encq7l/lets_break_something_part_2/fefwwli/)). I explained that we all knew we were generating approximations to random numbers, as the maximum number limitations of our machine, the computer, were assumed. *Our assignment was to generate random strings* ***within an upper-limit boundary of the integers***.

&amp;nbsp;
This brings me to what I ""left out,"" which should be obvious but the person with whom I gave the opportunity to demonstrate claimed knowledge, did not take that opportunity, leaving it to me.

&amp;nbsp;
*To select an actual, factual random number* ***from an unbounded set of numbers*** *is impossible.*

&amp;nbsp;
Does that need an explanation?

&amp;nbsp;
Any algorithm (method of selection) would need to be able to reference the last number in the available set.

&amp;nbsp;
Does that need an explanation?

&amp;nbsp;
***Infinity does not have a value***, though Mathematics achieves useful results when it is treated as though it has a value.

&amp;nbsp;
Now, we've come to the point to ask, what ***exactly*** is the meaning of ""random"" in the term ""random process"" in the context of the ToBE? In the context of nubmer selection from infinite sets of numbers, we've seen that it is impossible.",1579222010

t1_felezcl,jumboseafood,"This qoute explains the sheer insanity of Walt suggests.

 

&gt;alt Brown proposed that for some reason the ""fountains of the deep"" broke open, which caused the mid-Atlantic ridge to form and pushed the continents to accelerate to highways speeds, because they fell down a hill. Here's his explanation, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9ZGt9UA-U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9ZGt9UA-U)  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously something the size of North America moving at highway speeds is going to require a lot of energy. NA, is pretty darn big, and pretty darn heavy. I roughly figured it out, I figured the crust is some 150 km deep, which would give me a volume of \~3,000,000,000 km3. I assumed it made entirely of Feldspar, which has a density of 2,500,000,000,000 kg/km3. My rough math has NA weighing in at 7 \*1021 kg... that's a big number. Let's write it out just to see how big it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg  
&gt;  
&gt;Well since we know that the entire thing is moving at 20 m/s we can figure out the kenetic energy it has. That would be the energy needed to both start and stop the entire continent to highway speeds (that needs to be said again to highlight just how absurd this is)  
&gt;  
&gt;KE = 0.5 × mass × velocity2 or KE = 0.5 (7\*1021)(202)  
&gt;  
&gt;The answer is, 1.4 \*1024 J. That again is a really, huge, bigly, number. And that's just the Kinetic energy it has, it doesn't include the energy needed to accelerate it, friction, wind resistance (!?!?) etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;1.4 \* 1024 Joules of energy can boil every last drop of water on the entire planet, 100 times over  
&gt;  
&gt;All of this happened... because North America fell down a hill! Of course God decided that he liked Iceland and spared it from ripping in 2 even though the mid-Alantic ridge runs right through it. [http://c8.alamy.com/comp/B1TYJK/mid-atlantic-ridge-fault-line-thingvellir-national-park-iceland-B1TYJK.jpg](http://c8.alamy.com/comp/B1TYJK/mid-atlantic-ridge-fault-line-thingvellir-national-park-iceland-B1TYJK.jpg) How does Walt Brown explain this catasrophic event throwing entire continents around like rag dolls in one area, and in the next making a nice hiking trail? He doesn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's just so much else wrong with this it becomes an exercise in calculating the absurd. Using an asteroid impact calculator tool, I get even more crazy effects of an North American sized ateriod hitting the earth at 20m/s. Like a magnitude 11.5 earthquake on the exact opposite side of the earth.

t3_ep8qv8,ursisterstoy,"Part 2:
The really absurd ones come near the end such as multiple myths about a flood that don’t agree with each other to the ability to walk upright like we share with gibbons that regularly walk upright as their primary means of locomotion on the ground to the morality we share with elephants, monkeys, and carnivores to the intelligence we share with elephants, carnivores, rodents, primates, cetaceans, and cephalopods. At least they do mention completely useless garbage DNA and viral genes shared at the exact same locations on our chromosomes as pseudogenes ironically also can be found located in the very same location as the still functional genes in other organisms but broke in the same way in the closest related groups such as all haplorrine primates having a missing guanine in their vitamin C producing gene at the same spot and hamsters missing a cytosine at a completely different location so that both groups have to eat to obtain the vitamin C they can no longer make but still require this vitamin for survival. I may be wrong about the exact mutation but it’s something like this that shows how these groups are literally related on top of all of the other evidence such as merged chromosomes, functional genes located in the same location, viruses in our DNA located at the same location and several other things that would be such extreme coincidences that the probability of them arising independently would be so negligent as to be worth overlooking unless they were supposed to be a sign of how incompetent and weak the assumed designer was when they stuck all of this garbage in the same place in multiple independent lineages as if it was incapable of designing in a way that wouldn’t look like common ancestry. 

Then of course, when you take all of the evidence from geology, physics, and stratigraphy to determine how old everything is that we dig up we see not just a bunch of dead things that look like they were designed to be in between other things living at the same time. They are actually intermediate between the older and newer versions of the same type of organisms living in the same locations. We also have evidence of migration so that we can demonstrate the origin of a group and the migration of it to a new environment on top of it evolving to better survive in the new environment. The evidence here also provides such intermediates that appear to be part of two groups at the same time showing a clear intermediate from one to the other like Australopithecus sediba, Homo naledi, and Kenyanthropus platyops showing morphological affinities with both Australopithecus and Homo which is only explained by the older group eventually giving rise to the newer group. This is also a good indication of Homo being a subset of Australopithecus just like both groups are a subset of hominini which includes chimpanzees and bonobos and this group being a subset of homininae which include dryopithecus and gorillas which is a subset of Hominidae which also includes orangutans and several other extinct intermediate groups. This group is a subset of hominodea which also includes gibbons and siamangs that walk bipedally just like every member of Hominidae is also capable of at least part of the time. The origin of this group is something like proconsul which refutes the claim that we haven’t found any intermediates between humans and [the other] apes with aegyptopithecus, propliopithecus, and other groups showing a clear transition from apes and the other old world monkeys like Barbary apes. There are clear transitions between all monkeys like Eosimius and Victoriapithecus and clear transitions between rodent like and primate like animals like Purgatorias. There are several transitions between this and earlier mammals like Juramaia which was likely an early Eutherian mammal on our side of the split from what would eventually give rise to marsupials and other therian mammals showing a transition from laying eggs to giving live birth with the Metatherians (like marsupials) providing a living example of what something like that would look like once it stopped laying eggs (though a pouch likely evolved once and in the metatherian lineage). So there is evidence that mammals all used to lay eggs like monotremes still do. There are transitions for the move from cold blooded to warm blooded, the origin of mammary glands from sweat glands, the origin of hair independently from feathers, the origins of the mammalian serpentine gait still shared by whales, the origin of ear bones from bits of the jaw, the transition to the mammal jaw from a more reptilian one, the origin of differentiated teeth. Before all of these transitions we have what looks like a lizard as the common ancestor of all living mammals, birds, and reptiles with several transitions between that and a more amphibious morphology and transitions between tetrapods and fish, with lungfish being a side-branch off of one of those earlier divisions. And when all vertebrates were fish there are transitions between the earliest ones and those that gave rise to vertebrates with bones in place of cartilage on our side and those that maintain a cartilage skeleton except for the jaw on the side leading to sharks, skates, and rays. We have transitions from lawless fish to gnathostomes. We have transitions from swimming worms to actual fish. About this long ago we are in the Cambrian and pretty much everything was soft bodied but genetics, embryology, and other fields of study link us to echinoderms, arrow worms, and flat worms. Flat worms being a representative of what the common ancestor of deuterostomes and proterostomes likely emerged from. Hox genes, nerve cells, and other features link us to the cnidarians next with groups like placozoans and sponges resembling the earliest animals. We’ve demonstrated how easily multicellularity can arise while also showing how sponges are more like a community of single celled organisms than truly multicellular animals - and how living protists called choanoflagellates can also form communities that resemble true sponges. These also resemble the sperm of multicellular animals, choanocytes of sponges and the epithelial cells of more complex animals. Going much beyond this is based mostly on genetics because embryology can’t tell us much more when the most complex living organisms are single celled asexual reproducers that sometimes utilize miotic recombination and don’t develop via an embryo and when single celled organisms that died over a billion years ago don’t leave behind much in the way of fossil evidence. We can still compare morphological homologies but genetics provides a better picture of the order in which these novel traits evolved which also includes all of the evidence for endosymbiosis as the origin of eukaryotes. Archaea and Bacteria being the most complex life of over two billion years ago and likely diverging during the period described as abiogenesis likely originated from a shared chemical precursor to life or something more like a lipid membrane wrapped around a strand of RNA. Some viruses seem to be the result of a loss of complexity as descendants of actual life but the others resemble chemicals that diverged from a chemical precursor to actual life. What the most simple examples in each case share is RNA which is shown to be able to replace both DNA and proteins in a so-called RNA world, especially if these nucleotide sequences developed and became isolated from the environment within the same type of clay. There are several gaps in our understanding when it comes to abiogenesis but evolution and chemistry are both really well understood and can both be understood with accuracy with or without a god. Chemistry is possible because of physics with electromagnetism involved in binding ions into complex chemicals, thermodynamics involved in converting geothermal energy into chemical complexity, and the other forces involved in holding atoms together and in radiometric decay. Also, the mass of several fundamental particles comes from the Higgs field pushing us all the way down into particle physics and quantum mechanics. Essentially this is based on thermodynamics as well being one of the most fundamental properties of reality such that all change is a result of energy gradients (and not supernatural interference) and these are likely a result of eternal inflation or something else just beyond our full understanding. One flavor of deism attempts to explain these with a supernatural source but even this fails to provide any explanatory power and all other supernatural explanations failing every test thrown at them. So, yes physics does conflict with ~~magic~~ the existence of a god but evolution works just fine with or without a supernatural origin of life. Even with a creation evolution is still occurring and it still accounts for the diversity of life. Extending this all the way out to cosmology as to eliminate the supernatural entirety is a problem of creationism forcing a one or the other black and white fallacy. Just because evolution occurs and has been occurring for billions of years and has shown that all life likely originated from a common, albeit not yet alive, common ancestor doesn’t mean that evolution is atheistic in nature with about 81% of Christians accepting that it happens, especially if they don’t have to remove a god from the picture to tell us how life evolved from a common ancestor that lived several billions of years ago. It is only among the more evangelical denominations that it seems to matter if theistic evolution is an option for them to accept evolution over creationism. 

In summary, these 95 problems “with evolution” are actually 95 problems with creationists misrepresenting the data or outright lying when they know better. Half of these don’t even apply to evolution and the ones that don’t c",1579211263
t3_ep8qv8,ursisterstoy,"Part 1:

I don’t think there is anything on this list that I haven’t responded to already despite about 50% of it having absolutely nothing whatsoever with evolution and about 100% of these being completely wrong to varying degrees. I forget the actual numbers, but we have an argument that no known mechanism could convert a singularity to an entire universe despite this already being addressed by eternal inflation (which also eliminates the universe creator), several arguments for how mutations don’t create new information despite every mutation resulting in a new code, even if the phenotype doesn’t change because of it, and several obvious dramatic phenotypical changes within the same species such that all that is necessary for actual macro-evolution which begins with speciation and not the formation of brand new organs and other features is some genetic isolation. Already very looking groups like chihuahuas and poodles or cauliflower and kale just stop interbreeding for whatever reason and while the same changes keep piling up eventually these groups start of not being able to make fertile hybrids naturally, before they can’t make any hybrids even with artificial insemination. Nothing stops being part of every single clade its ancestors belonged to just because a new subdivision of that clade arises. 

Despite all of these different fields of science together eliminating the need or even the possibility for a supernatural conscious and completely undetectable intelligent designer being, evolution by itself is just about the diversity of life. Micro evolution only refers to the small changes within a breeding population while macro evolution is exactly the same process with genetic isolation and time. Abiogenesis is about the origin of life, chemical evolution as described by creationists is just chemistry, radiometric decay rates are measured and observed including their measured consistency and the multiple independent dating methods converging on the same estimate such that the more used in tandem, the more specific the estimate and the more likely the estimate is to be accurate and reliable as the alternative would be a dozen different methods independently converging on the same date and ironically being wrong by the very same amount - such as radiocarbon dating, ice cores, dendrochronology giving the same age for an event within the last 50,000 years or potassium-argon, uranium-lead, and a handful of other methods independently converging on 4.6 billion years for the age of our planet and the methods for dating stars estimating the age of our sun to just a very slight bit older than the age of our planet and observed planetary formation not applying to our solar system and trigonometry being useless for measuring distance and the measured rate of the speed of light being useless for determining the minimum amount of time necessary for us to observe what we observe at these great distances. 
onflict with a creator such that even with a god, supernatural creation of any aspect of reality, especially life as independent kinds of life, is wrong. It didn’t even hold up to scrutiny with a Christian judge presiding over the case for intelligent design and there are som many fundamental flaws with creationism that a book was written to expose them.",1579211233

I think  that about summarizes  your level of reading comprehension.  

You take someone saying  something isn't specifically stated in the bible and them saying the thing follows logically as a contradiction while people with an intermediate level of skill in reading comprehension know otherwise.  You then make conclusions in your head and base your rhetoric on your demonstrated incompetence in said reading
 comprehension'

You are like a walking illustration of  - ignorance is bliss.

Its not specified in the Bible any of the apostles had children but if I said it was likely that among them they had some pretty good parenting advice -according to your level of reasoning and reading comprehension - I am ""making things up"".   Instead in the thinking world most people would consider that well within the frame of logic given the Bible does say  some were married and its unlikely that in a group of twelve  most who would be married  one would have had at least one child. 

Most Bible scholars hold that Joseph died  before Christ's ministry began even though the Bible does not specifically say so .  According to you they are  ""making things up"" because they logically deduce he died  since he is not mentioned  again, People around him in some narratives mention Mary but not him,   and  when Jesus is dying he seems to suggest that she be taken care of by the apostles but never mentions Joseph.

In genesis one the actual text tells us  that all the great variation of land bound animals are  the result of single solitary command  given to the earth. people with reasonable intelligence  recognize that when one thing creates thousands of different things the one thing must have tremendous variability built into it. You instead barf  - thats making things up.  

Of course  another piece of ignorance is driving your train as well. You have no idea how to respond to the actual text there of Genesis because all you know is the YEC inspired caricature that Genesis says  all the creatures were created independently.

When you don't have that, 80% (or more) of your argument and alleged evidence blows away in the wind like the straw it always was.  You are left without much to rely on but clutching your now thinning  out blanket of straw  and sucking  your ""well that just made up"" thumb.

t1_fee96kt,cubist137,"&gt; While this is the common mantra - that we can't detect design…

Who said we can't detect design? We most certainly *can* detect design. The protocol for doing so is fairly simple, and it depends on the fact that any physical object that's ever been Designed *must necessarily* have *also* been **manufactured**. So the protocol runs somewhat thus:

One, form a hypothesis of how whatever-it-is was *manufactured*.

Two, figure out the physical entailments of that hypothesis of manufacture. As one example, if the hypothesis of manufacture includes ""these pieces were cut by a saw"",  the physical entailments of that hypothesis include ""the saw should have left tooth-marks on the material"".

Three, examine the whatever-it-is, looking for evidence that would let us decide whether the hypothesis of manufacture is, or is not, valid.

This protocol is, of course, nothing like any of the putative design-detection protocols that ID-pushers, and Creationists (but I repeat myself…), present themselves as having.

t1_fejbywj,CHzilla117,"&gt;This creationist sees a right to hypothesis that dna is so glorious in complexity it has within it the ability to trigger needed results.

DNA is complex, but a lot about it is known, and what you propose is not viable. No test that has exposed organism's to hostile conditions has increased the genetic diversity. That is something caused only by time. And there is also a level of hypocrisy here. On a previous thread, you were complaining because you erroneously thought that evolution was only based on geology and didn't have a mechanism for how organism's evolved. But now are actually doing that. You are just relying on saying DNA is complex to hand wave your lack of evidence (and evidence to the contrary) without even a mechanism..

&gt;Okay. This creationist sees a right to hypothesis that dna is so glorious in complexity it has within it the ability to trigger needed results. IT is the results that is the evidence for this ability. i see it everywhere. It must be so.

That is not how it works. Making up an explain for a phenomenon and then saying since the phenomenon is real so is the expatiation is not science. That is just a one prospered hypothesis for how the results came about. In your case, it is a falsified one while the results are already explained by something else, you just don't like the perceived implications.

&gt;The african population changed more then anyone if we all were one tribe at Babel. many details to deal with sun, heat, possibly humidity.

If true that would apply to other areas as well. But the diversity of Native Americans, for instance, is just a subset of the diversity of part of northern Asia, which is in turn just a subset of the diversity of Africa. This is exactly what happens when small populations branch out from larger ones, grow, and then a small group branches out from the new population. This is since the small groups that branch out will have only a portion of the genes of the original population. This is called the founder effect. It is not a result of adaptation, since areas with equally harsh conditions would see the same result, but they don't.

&gt;Some creationists might see mutations just being selected on and possibly stress increasing a diversity in mutations. they might cite some studies stress can do this.

That is a lot of ""mights"" in there. If you could cite studies you would. Instead you are just engaging in wishful thinking.

And any increase in the mutation rate would not be able to account for the level of diversity within such a shot period of time. While creationists claim like genetic entropy are unfounded since the current mutation rate is low enough to prevent to many harmful mutations, increasing the mutation past that point creates increasing problems since the mutation rate create to many negative mutations each generation for natural selection to handle. Any population with a mutation rate as high as required for what you propose would have so many negative mutations they would not be able to have a viable population.

&gt; Then also different populations migrated there and were likewise affected. Peoples from ham and Shem.

If African diversity was a combination of other groups, that would be a viable hypothesis. It is not. The vast diversity they have is not seen in other populations. But the parts they share are also shared by populations close by. In turn all other populations share only a potion of their diversity, and so on and so on.

&gt;there is no reason to score it and conclude a leaving africa concept. migrating to Africa does the trick better I think.

To put it all together, it is exactly what one would expect from populations leaving Africa, no other mechanism explains it, and your proposed one doesn't lead to your predicated results when populations are under the exact same scenarios.

And then there is how the fossil evidence some the exact same events as the genetic evidence. That is the thing about evolution, various lines of evidence showing the exact same thing. Meanwhile the evidence never points at what creationists claim. No fossil, archaeological, or genetic evidence for what you claim.

t1_feian3g,ursisterstoy,"Very interesting write up about the behavior and intelligence of squirrels and how you think they view us. I’d agree that they are quite intelligent problem solvers that tend to enjoy the comfort of the nests they build inside trees and wouldn’t worship humans as gods if they had a concept of what a god was. We have a tendency to destroy the environments that we inhabit such that if other animals and plants want to survive they need to adapt to our way of life. Mice, rats, flies, cockroaches and similar animals get a lot of benefit from our existence and in special cases the same thing applies to squirrels with feeder containers and other ease of food acquisition situations we set up for them. 

However, it is also their cognitive limitations that help set them apart from the primates. Yes, primates tend to be some of the intelligent and keepers of human-like morality but that’s to be expected of animals closely related to humans. It is how these behaviors and abilities are mirrored in less related animals like squirrels, elephants, mice, dogs, cheetahs and bears and even the octopus (when considering intelligence alone) that shows that these traits are evolutionary developments. 

It is also interesting that it is also humans that show a tendency towards religion the most, but the precursors to this such as empathy, fairness, a sense of mortality and agency detection apply to wider variety of animals. This allows us to better understand how humans basically invented all of the gods they’ve ever believed in, regardless if there is something like a god completely hidden from view. Besides humans, chimpanzees have the highest tendency towards religious beliefs. Besides humans, chimpanzees are the best example of technologically sophisticated. Besides humans, chimpanzees are the most compassionate and understanding of fairness. A squirrel might remember where nuts are hiding because of spatial recognition and they might have the problem solving abilities to create unique ways of crossing an obstacle course, but primates show an elevated capacity in both of these situations as is expected by evolutionary theory. Animals most related to us will also be the most like us genetically, behaviorally, cognitively, and morally with the next most related animals showing more similarities to us in these areas than the more distantly related groups. 

The carnivores, elephants, horses, and cetaceans appear to have slightly weakened abilities in some of these areas but they clearly have a high level of intelligence, moral capacity, and sense of their own mortality over the insects, fish, and maybe even birds. Birds are intelligent and creative creatures too, but they are less related to us than these other groups and they show striking differences in how they accomplish these tasks. Birds being dinosaurs which are archosaurs which are reptiles have several affinities with their group not found in ours but the traits they share with us are found in most amniotic tetrapods.

Everything forms a branching hierarchy in this way such that it is clear that nothing evolves towards a teleological goal nor was everything created in its present state or as distinctly isolated kinds of life.

MICRO AND MACRO EVOLUTION 

There  is  not  a  single  verifiable  example  of  macro  evolution.  A  succession  of  micro  evolutionary  events  does  not  result  in  macro  evolution  because  no  new  organs,  structures  or  functions  are  created  and  no  increase  of  information  in  the  respective  creature’s  genetic  material  takes  place.  Added  to  that  is  the  fact  that  some  micro  evolution  observed  today  proceeds 10,000 to ten million times faster than that generally derived from fossils.

Developments, genetic alterations in individuals and in the succession  of  generations  really  do  occur.  A  good  example  of  this is the development of breeds within a biological species. In this way, from the grey wolf species (Canis lupus) hundreds of breeds  of  dog  originated,  from  Pekingese  to  St  Bernard.  Dog,  however, remains dog. That is micro evolution.

Great   variability   is   observed   within   a   non-exceeded   bandwidth.  A  broad  development  of  breeds  has  taken  place,  especially with regard to domestic animals. With these, man has garnered mutations, crossed them with each other and selected according  to  his  preference.  In  this  way,  for  instance,  the  rock  dove  breed  (Columba  livia),  in  which  Darwin  took  a  lot  of  interest,  has  been  subdivided  into  over  a  thousand  breeds  by  breeders.

During  his  research  expedition  to  the  Galapagos  Islands,  Darwin collected different finch specimens. A remarkably large number of species of finch can be found on these Pacific islands. 

In total, thirteen species, which differ significantly in body size, and beak size and shape, can be identified.. These Darwin finches are often invoked as proof of evolution in general, although it is indisputable that the changes in these birds lie within the domain of  micro  evolution.  These  different  variations  are  still  finches and will continue to remain finches (1).

Macro evolutionary developments

According to Darwin’s teaching on the origin of species, living organisms  should,  in  their  biological  history,  be  able  to  create  completely  new,  not  previously  present,  complex  blueprints,  organs  and  functions  by  spontaneous  events  in  their  genetic  machinery,  mutation,  selection,  gene  transfer,  combination  of  gene segments, gene duplication and other factors. In this sense, the term “higher development” is generally used.

In  an  assumed  case  of  higher  development  for  instance;  mammals from reptiles, structures such as hairs, milk glands, mechanisms  for  controlling  temperature  and  everything  else  that  differentiates  mammals  from  reptiles  would  have  to  emerge. These  supposedly  newly-created  structures  do  not  differ  from the “old” structures by only one gene but usually by many genes, whose spatial and chronological activity patterns must be compatible with one another. With macro evolutionary processes, this would have to be the case with each individual intermediate form. The orchestra of genes must always be in tune.

What is evolution?

The Dutch Standaard Encyclopedie under the heading “Evolution” reads as follows: “Macro evolution, which embraces the periodic appearance and dispersal of new groups as happens in the course of  the  geological  periods,  and  which  affects  the  higher  orders  of classification such as genera, families and orders or classes, cannot be accounted for directly by experimental genetics. The assumptive hypotheses based on the drastic alteration of genetic traits, cannot, in fact, be proved.”

The causes, which are supposed over the course of millions of years to have led to the increased complexity of living creatures, are unknown. The biologist Willem J. Ouweneel concludes that genetics does not provide a basis for belief in macro evolution. In his opinion it emphasises quite the opposite: that the original forms of life, mostly the species but sometimes the genera and even perhaps the families, as variable as they may be, are as a whole constant and mutually discontinuous (2).

Rapid speciation and/or micro evolution

That  micro  evolution  takes  place  is  not  disputed.  Indeed,  it  is  also documented that it can proceed 10,000 to ten million times faster than that claimed for many fossil sequences (3) (4).Contrary  to  previous  assumptions,  animals  can  adapt  to  changing  environmental  conditions  within  a  few  generations  (5).  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  for  palaeontologically  proven  micro  evolutionary  processes,  from  a  biological  point  of  view,  no  greater timescales were required (6).

I already did complete with chapter and verse plus logic.  Your empty denials are of no consequence. its a fact plain as day in scripture that land animal were created by one command in gensis one .  That logically means variations are  part of that one command and  one of the variations seen before darwin' had  baby grandfather is difference in spatial dimensions .

&gt;Yes well, in my naivety I thought context mattered. I thought that might have been why you capitalised the word ""identical"".

of course context matters.  Hilariously I made the same...I mean  IDENTICAL point in the linked to thread I gave you and was told by your friends here  - only dictionaries matter  not context .

of course you do because your point got blown up.You are not even trying to engage your error being pointed out  - you are just going to hand wave and pretend that it doesn't matter.   That's what you are doing in other threads as well.  Just pretend you never got debunked.

&gt; My point is that a 15x increase in nerve transmission time (or highway transit time) means that after a specific nerve impulse is sent (or the car you are in) it takes 15x longer to get to its destination

and your ""point"" was already debunked  so the pretense just continues - you can't even give any indication that it has any impact on the giraffe  because you have already admitted  you don't know if it does - so its  really just an empty assertion  - length matter even when I don't know if it does.

&gt;Mental processing speed is not at stake here: it's an increase in the total time it takes to use that part of the body (in my example, the vocal cords). Total reaction time includes mental processing time and message transmission time. When messages take longer to arrive it increases the reaction time no matter what the processing time is.

Of course it still matters to your analogy

&gt;the cognitive difference in experience between an hour long drive and FOURTEEN HOURS is significant. The difference between driving 15 feet at 1 MPH or 14 mph is nearly indiscernible.

comparing  a process that lasts 14 hours extra  to 1.5 second is forever a fail. The comparison of cognitive awareness in a nervous system is not analogous.  You absolulely failed to  take that into consideration with your claim of  ratios beinb the same because the congitive experience of both are NOT equal in ratio. Its 600 to 1. 

&gt;Lions would get a 0.4 second head start, which might easily result in the death of a giraffe in that family.

and you know   that how ? Your best guess?  Here again you are just leaving out numbers again.  They show you wrong again.  This time the difference between  The speed of a giraffe and a lion. Any encounter between a giraffe and a lion that comes down to a second or two - the giraffe is  in trouble regardless. of length of laryngeal nerve. Top speed of a giraffe is significantly slower. No abiity to warn a second earlier will matter. 

To use an extreme  comparison - a turtle can have even minute earlier response than another and and it will make zero difference  not being tagged by a hare. So once again you have failed to show  a practical  result of any meaning to the giraffe

In addition like I told you (but you ignored) all that argument makes no difference to the YEC creatonists  you mostly debate.  You don't understand their position THere IS NO DEATH wen god creates the giraffe . Theres none until the fall.  SO  in many ways you have completed missed the mark and I will ask again

&gt;exactly whats the down side of a giraffe having a few seconds delay in a world with no death?? Whats going to require a recognition in under a second? 

&gt; It doesn't matter how fast the giraffe can think, 

and fair enough.. so how does that make your analogy any more analogous when your analogy has 14 hours of cognitive  experience trying to masquerade as analogous to  1.5 seconds? Answer it doesn't its  not analogous at all.  the difference in delay is 600 to 1 in terms of resulting experience

All your arguments have failed  and failed pretty badly. Wouldn't it be  more honest approach be to say  - well I can't say how that affects the giraffe in any practical way so I can't sue it as an anti design argument rather than this mindless  - length equals  no designer.  

Your  desperation is telling - you  have to stick with a 15 times emphasis mantra  because  you know that if you emphasize the result of  a difference of around a second  (most likely  much less ) that the claim will sound as weak as water  - because it is.",1579137472

t3_ep8qv8,OddJackdaw,"[\#65  Paradigm of evolution](http://www.0095.info/en/index_thesesen_95onesentencethesesagainste_paradigmofevolution.html)

&gt; Polls have shown that many people are of the opinion that evolution theory is a scientifically- proven fact. Few know that scientists operate with provisional models (verification) and contradictions (falsification). The prevailing patterns of thought (paradigm) of evolution, primordial soup and the big bang theory are of philosophical origin (enlightenment, rationalism/naturalism) and cannot be proven with the methods of natural science.

Aparently the author doesn't know what the words fact or theory mean. From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_fact_and_theory) refuting this argument: 

&gt; Many scientists and philosophers of science have described evolution as fact and theory, a phrase which was used as the title of an article by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould in 1981. He describes fact in science as meaning data, not absolute certainty but ""confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent"". A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of evolution come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical common descent, and from transitions in the fossil record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.[1]

&gt; Each of the words ""evolution"", ""fact"" and ""theory"" has several meanings in different contexts. Evolution means change over time, as in stellar evolution. In biology it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in gene frequency over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, fact can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, theory can mean an opinion or conjecture (e.g., ""it's only a theory""), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of ""well-substantiated explanation"". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of linguistic analysis.",1579134068
t1_feg6pl5,GaryGaulin,"&gt;What? I’m very confused by your response here about not owning a tree and being magically created to live on the ground and feed squirrels peanut butter.

I was thinking about my wife who has squirrels and other animals she knows by name here a dozen at a time all competing for best act like holding out one hand at the door, while another does their mouth chewing with hand signals at the kitchen window. Copying exactly what another squirrel does is the kind of thing that starts turf wars. 

A squirrel only feels at home in a ""rule our own castle"" way when it is in a tree that they control with warm nest to winter over in. What an animal calls ""home"" depends on what we are adapted for. Around our house they have been using decades old tobacco netting (not good for much else) I left them to rope things together well, but not sure how. Squirrels do deserve credit for being good at out thinking their competition, for example when others are looking pretend to stash food then hide it from sight while scurrying away to a safer place to hide something.

Ground animals that eat each other must be a horrific realm they normally want no part of, while us ground dwellers do not want to live in their tree regardless of with good aim being able to crap on us that way. I myself have to be careful not to upset the outdoor powers that be, that live in the trees, I often work under.

I sense that some of the dominant squirrels would think its totally nuts for a speciest ground dwelling tree killer like Robert Byers to believe that they are like a God. In their world my wife may like a saint deserve honorary acceptance and respect into their society, while most others are monsters the planet would be best without.

It's too bad that squirrels can't type out their thoughts, yet. I think it would be fascinating to see their reaction to Reddit religion forums.

no you tried with a a poor analogy of  driving time and got that solidly debunked.  After claiming you had caught me in an error  you just left off the thread when I showed  it was you that had made an error. NO the bravest move I have ever seen but understandable

&gt;he incredulity towards creation/design is a result of the overwhelming soundness of the argument made by the theory of evolution; it is not the basis for the argument itself. It is not a logical fallacy to reject an argument (creation ""theory"") which has no supporting evidence, in favor of another argument (theory of evolution) which is supported by mountains of it.

unfortunately you are only spouting what is apparently this  reddit's standard ignorance  -  Conflating  design with YEC and evolution with no design.

You never had an ounce of evidence to back up anything against design (or frankly just about any other ""Creationism"" but YEC)  because design is not even anti evolution which is why among IDist there are  people who adhere to evolution.

Your mountain of evidence is the product of both you imagination and  your comparison to a conflated  only YEC view of design.

As such. just like your analogy  before,  your whole argument is a bust. 

&gt;Perhaps if you would explain the details of whatever ""designer"" and design process you want to talk about, then we could talk about that.

t1_feg50a0,andrewjoslin,"&gt;So its you that have the maths wrong because you have only factored in the ratio of the distance not the ratio to the processing ability and the nerve speed over a 14 foot journey.

I think the ratio is actually the only thing that matters here. In an ideal (lossless) communication channel (a nerve communicating electrical impulses, or a road ""communicating"" cars) I think the bandwidth (impulses received per second, or car throughput per second) remains the same regardless of the transmission distance (length of nerve or road). My point is that a 15x increase in nerve transmission time (or highway transit time) means that after a specific nerve impulse is sent (or the car you are in) it takes 15x longer to get to its destination. For some nerves (and roads), such an increase in transmission time could be devastating to the primary function of the communication channel.

&gt;And then what event in the average life of a giraffe does that make a difference to if they could even mentally process in that time? In your normal day life do you notice a difference between .1 and .5 seconds?

If I'm reading this correctly, the laryngeal nerve is the only thing that can open the vocal cords: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cricoarytenoid_muscle .

Have you ever heard of lions? And how they like to stalk unsuspecting prey? Don't you think that a giraffe who had to wait an extra 0.4 seconds to use its vocal cords would find it harder to warn its family when a lion darts out of the underbrush? Lions would get a 0.4 second head start, which might easily result in the death of a giraffe in that family.

Mental processing speed is not at stake here: it's an increase in the total time it takes to use that part of the body (in my example, the vocal cords). Total reaction time includes mental processing time _and message transmission time_. When messages take longer to arrive it increases the reaction time no matter what the processing time is.

&gt;the average non biased reader hearing the argument that a designer is ruled out because it takes two or three seconds compared to under half a second would say -- ""What?""

Re-examine my analogy using this math:

Reaction time = transmission time of stimuli to brain + time taken to process stimuli + transmission time of reaction to larynx. (See the ""types"" section here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_chronometry , it matches reasonably well despite a few simplifications that I've bundled under ""processing time"")

The length of the laryngeal nerve detour increases that last term 15x, while leaving the other 2 constant. It doesn't matter how fast the giraffe can think, elongation of the laryngeal nerve _must_ increase its reaction time whenever it tries to use its larynx.",1579131251

&gt; Recent research results obtained at the Paul Flechsig Brain Research Institute at the University of Leipzig have now shown that light is not scattered or lost at all in the human eye. So-called Muellerian cells conduct the light from the front surface of the retina to the light-sensitive cells embedded in the back of the retina, whereby their function is similar to that of a fibre optic cable. The light is thus transmitted without losing intensity between the nerve cells through to the light-sensitive cells. The conical shape of the Muellerian cells collects light instead of scattering it. What this means is that our vision is optimized by just this specific arrangement of nerve cells, Muellerian cells, rods and cones (1).
&gt; 
&gt; It therefore makes sense that the light-sensitive cells lie beneath the others because they require the most energy, of which they are ensured an optimum supply by their location right above the blood vessels. Another factor is that the blood vessels also cool the light-sensitive cells, preventing damage to the retina that could otherwise be caused by infrared radiation (2). In squids the cells are arranged in the opposite order because these animals live in cool water. In this case, it does make sense to position the light-sensitive cells in the top layer, since the eyeball is cooled by the water (3).

First off, I am not sure how they conceive of this as an argument against evolution. It is at best a rebuttal of an argument against creationism. 

But even there it fails. The ""fiber optic"" cells in question aren't actually anywhere near as efficient as actual fiber optics. They are so inefficient that each wavelength of light requires a different type of ""fiber optic"" cell optimized for it's portion of the spectrum. This is a perfectly sensible development under an evolutionary model, where bad design is often often the best it can do, but why would a creator resort to such an inefficient design, when they clearly are capable of creating optics that transmit all wavelengths efficiently (see the lens of the eye)?

Of course, as I often point out, any question that starts with ""why would..."" is often an argument from incredulity or ignorance, and that's no different here. This is not evidence *against* a creator. 

But trying to cite this as if it refutes the eye as an example of bad design misses the pitch by a mile. Even with these cells, the eye still makes far more sense in the context of evolution than it does as evidence of an intelligent designer.",1579129686

&gt; The renowned geologist Ariel A. Roth researched how much rubble, mud, and debris todays rivers wash into the oceans, year after year. He calculated that after ten million years, the continents would be eroded to sea level if they were not simultaneously being raised by tectonic processes. Even if, in the past, significantly less material had been washed down, it is clear that at least in the upper rock strata, it should not have been possible to find fossils that were considerably older than ten million years. They must have long since been washed away.

This entire argument acts as if there's never anything that builds up sediment anywhere. But there are. Lava flows, river deltas, and other depositional basins are where this eroded sediment gets redeposited. Much of it ends up on the continental shelf, which can either get uplifted or exposed by lowering sea levels. It doesn't just disappear. While the continents are eroded in some places, that sediment necessarily builds up new rock in other places. This would not erode the continents to sea level, but it would imply that most places have a patchy record. Guess what? That's what we see. 

And no, I'm not the only one claiming this. Fun fact, this argument **directly contradicts** another creationist argument; namely that  [volcanoes are adding material to the crust too rapidly for an old earth](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD502.html). Pick one. 

**22: River deltas, sea coasts and reefs**

Quote: 

&gt; The material washed into lakes and seas by rivers and streams allows conclusions to be drawn as to how long these processes have already lasted. It is amazing that there is not a single river delta anywhere on Earth that can definitely be significantly more than 10,000 years old. Even if one studies the current changes in lakes and sea coasts, the Earths surface, as it is today, can never be millions or billions of years old.

Not a fact. [The Mississippi River Delta has deposits going back 100 million years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_Delta#Geologic_history) No, YECS, the *current* delta is not the only delta, because the delta shifts every few hundred years. 

**23: Eruption of Mount St. Helens**

Lyellian Uniformitarianism was abandoned nearly a century ago, before YECism as a movement even materialized. Geologists realized decades before ya'll popped up that rapid geologic changes do indeed exist. My geology professor constantly mocks Lyell for being too opposed to the catastrophists of his day and missing their good points. 

Want to know why we don't jump on your bandwagon that this means **all** geologic formations must be catastrophically deposited? Because the evidence does not support it. We embrace [Actualism.](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/actualism-assumptions) We do not require modern analogues to exist in the present. We do not require constant rates. We can and do infer depositional processes the likes of which have never been observed (Decan Traps Flood Basalts, Castile Formation, etc.) We only assume, as all sciences have too, that the laws of physics and chemistry are unchanging, and **until some way of testing the supernatural is achievable** we do not assume God miraculously created some features of the rock record. That second one is liable to be changed if you can postulate how God performed such a miracle, what traces it would predict, and show us a working model that is successful in locating such traces. 

**24: Modern sedimentology**

These guys need to work on their phrasing and try to be more clear. It's hard to understand their point here. Quote: 

&gt; Modern sedimentology confirms that the characteristic traits of the sediment strata, which are visible and accessible to researchers, point to short and intensive depositions. It would be difficult to validate the time periods of up to hundreds of millions of years on the basis of the observed sedimentary structures (cross bedding/graded bedding). A rethinking is also taking place with regard to the interpretation of ultra-fine strata. In many cases, people are talking in terms of days rather than years.

And they go to give some examples. All of them are straw-men. I'm sorry, but no, cross bedding is not *only* formed by water. That's just one mechanism. Graded bedding has long been accepted to be evidence of flooding/turbidites/bouma sequences, among other things. This hasn't been contested for well over a century. And why do they mention daily rythmittes as if that helps their case? Why would we anticipate a global flood to leave stacks of daily rythmittes? 

**25: Undamaged layer boundaries**

Ah, this oldie but goldie. 

First of all, is there no erosion? Are the layers flat like pancakes? On a large enough scale, sure. [But there are an abundance of massive erosional unconformities in the rock record.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bc9cna/geological_evidence_shows_a_young_earth_and_a/ekwq1og/). Paleovalleys, meandering river channels, hell there are entire *buried landscapes* preserved all over the place. 

Some YECs will acknowledge these formations, yet say they ""aren't enough erosion"", a claim which ignores base level. If you have a layer of strata exposed for 6 million years, but it's never uplifted more than 100 feet above sea level (global base level), then the rivers can't cut any deeper than 100 feet. It doesn't matter how long that layer is exposed for. This means you can't somehow extrapolate ____ amount of vertical erosion per ___ million years. It doesn't work. 

I have no idea where they're getting a ""lack of bioturbation"" from considering how hard some YECs are working to refute bioturbation on carbonate hardgrounds. 

The page then outright claims paleosols don't exist, which is also just flat out wrong. [The Morrison Formation](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/oard-2011/morrison), for instance, has a ton of them.

t3_ep8qv8,ThurneysenHavets,"\#91 - The degeneration of language

This is another of my favourites, though that's probably largely bias towards my own field...

&gt;Investigations of ancient languages show that they were more complex in earlier times and became simpler over time.

Losing synthetic morphology is not the same as becoming less complex. Syntactic complexity is a thing, and is often gained as morphology is lost.

And even then, plenty of languages have been observed to gain synthetic morphology. I don't even have to look beyond their own examples to demonstrate that. Latin has done so in its own history, gaining a number of synthetic categories - including an imperfect, a future, a subjunctive and a gerund - which were absent from Proto-Indo-European, and gaining *further* synthetic categories as it evolved into Romance. So this is some top-level cherry-picking going on here.

Not surprising, then, that the cutting-edge linguistic research they cite includes... the Bible and some German evangelical.",1579127953
t1_fefwvzj,andrewjoslin,"&gt;In what tangible way is
it ""makes no sense to do so"" any different from ""since we can't think how"" it must be so - exactly what your side calls - an argument from incredulity.

Like I implied, all that evidence gives the argument a foundation besides incredulity. The incredulity is a side effect of generations of scientists considering the facts and carefully adjusting the theory of evolution to fit as much evidence as possible, so that now it's hard to believe that the current evidence could plausibly support any conclusion other than the modern theory of evolution. The incredulity towards creation/design is a result of the overwhelming soundness of the argument made by the theory of evolution; it is not the basis for the argument itself.

It is not a logical fallacy to reject an argument (creation ""theory"") which has no supporting evidence, in favor of another argument (theory of evolution) which is supported by mountains of it.

&gt;and how does UCA even disprove a designer? Goodness. All of you need to get out some more. Its quite obvious you all are not even remotely prepared to debate anyone except YECs.

I have explained why the laryngeal nerve in giraffes seems to indicate that there was either no ""designer"", or that ""designer"" was malicious, capricious, or just a poor designer. Of course this discussion has focused on the concept of a ""designer"" in the YEC model -- one which directly intervened to design and create all life on Earth at the level of ""kinds"" (which may be species, genera, or even to a few levels up depending on the YEC you ask). Therefore the YEC model is directly contradicted by the UCA theory, and UCA is a very relevant topic in such a discussion.

Perhaps if you would explain the details of whatever ""designer"" and design process you want to talk about, then we could talk about that. Until you clarify which thing you want to talk about, you can't blame me for accidentally talking about a closely related topic instead of the exact one you want.",1579127911

Honestly, there's nothing to deal with here. They don't understand that abiogenesis doesn't start from amino acids, or cells:

&gt;Even if amino acids were formed in a primordial soup, it would be necessary for them to concentrate in a further step and combine spontaneously to form practical molecular chains capable of carrying information. At least 500,000 base pairs are required to produce even the DNA of the simplest bacteria. Cell tissue, cell walls and various mechanisms must be formed simultaneously in order for the cell to be viable from the very beginning.

I think the most embarasing part is that they seem to conflate aminos and DNA. This reminds me of the standard creationist error of thinking that the abiogenesis product was a cell and that there has been no research more modern than the 1950s to source.

Of course, if they did understand the modern research, they wouldn't really have an argument. The RNA world is fairly sound, as far as a hypothesis goes, it's just a question of what evidence would remain today to prove it.",1579125176

[Modern studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology) have provided him with some vindication:

As well I should omit it since its  nonsensical. Is there  any such thing as unapparent elegance?

Not really, because you've just made that up. You can create ad hoc reasons why a designer might do anything. Evolutionary processes are constrained by their history. A designer isn't.

&gt;so once again another participant here is saying design = no evolution and evolution= no design with not a drop of evidence to back it up.

well it always helps to try and change the argument when your side has OBVIOUSLY lost. but does it?

Nope. Besides the point you have proven no lack of ""elegance"" 
(which is as subjective as it gets) if you command the earth to make  thousands of animals with a single command there quite obviously has to be a matrix  of features and modifications to accomplish that. That's unremarkable  since  we knew thousands of years before Darwin that animals shared  similar parts modified to the creature.

&gt;there is not allowed here the option for bodyplan changes just based on bodies being triggered to adapt to some unique stress. Surely blacks and others demonstrate this.

What you are suggesting has never been observed despite numerous tests to determine whether or not it could happen. The only way changes in body plan that weren't already in the organism's DNA happen is via mutation. The mutations that arise have nothing to do with the environment the organism is facing. A mutation that would help someone is a desert environment is as likely to happen in the tundra as the desert. Nor do stressful conditions increase the mutation rate. The environment merely determines which individuals live to pass on their genes, and mutations to non-functional parts of the genome have no selection factor.

And when a population is under stress, these parts of the genome do not see an increase in diversity. Indeed, since many more individuals die, the diversify of the parts in the population's genome is often reduced.

Then you have the problem of why it would just be the African population that has so much diversity. What you suggest predicts populations in harsh conditions would also have increased diversity, but those who lived in much harsher conditions, such as the Inuit in the Arctic, do not have the predicted diversity.

&amp;nbsp;
Further, there is a ***decimal precision*** contraint on computer-generated decimals: a Mathematical definition requires an infinite decimal precision. Therefore, our assignment could have been to generate a ""random"" number in the set from -M.P to +M.P, where 'M' is the whole number maximum and 'P' is the decimal precision maximum, ***but the professor would go insane*** attempting to determine whether our programs achieved the desired result ***which is ACTUALLY *pseudorandom* by Mathematical definition.*** The exact assignment was to ""write a program that generates multiple sets (strings) of random numbers of length == 10, taking as input the number of sets (use at least 10, no more than 20); the output is correct if there is no pattern found in a comparison of ***each*** of the sets and no pattern within any set.""

For example about the nature of light, in the 1800s they believed that there existed an ""ether"" which was the medium for light and that speed of light was relative to that ether and given heliocentrism that meant that the ether changes speed relative to the earth. [So they designed an experiment to see how the ether would move in relation to earth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) Turns out there was no difference in result for the same setup 6 months apart even though ether theory says there should be.

What? I’m very confused by your response here about not owning a tree and being magically created to live on the ground and feed squirrels peanut butter. 

For actual evolution, squirrels are rodents. Rodents include rats, mice, chipmunks, squirrels, flying squirrels, and prairie dogs. They have eyes on the side of their head just like their lagomorph (rabbits, hares, pikas) relatives. They also have a reduced brain size compared to euarchonta (which includes primates). It is mostly genetics and fossil organisms like Purgatorius that link rodents to primates during the time that non-avian dinosaurs ruled the planet. Rodents have lost their canines and they have incisors that keep growing so that they need to chew to keep them short and sharp. Living rodents have a small body size for scurrying up and living inside trees or burrowing in the ground. They are quite intelligent for what they are but they’ll lack in areas unique to primates.

t1_fefyr9x,DavidTMarks,"&gt;Did you even try to do the math? The laryngeal nerve detour on giraffes is 15', which is 15 times longer than the direct route of about 1'. My proposed 845 mile detour of I-10 is about 13.9 times as long as the actual 61 mile direct route. If anything, my analogy is too conservative.

Your analogy broken and can't be put together again . That's why I was and am confident to dismiss it. You have simply left out  other factors that  go into that ratio -  Nerve speed and  small distance in relationship to  cognitive processing ability.  

the cognitive difference in experience between an hour  long drive and FOURTEEN HOURS is significant.  The difference between  driving 15 feet at 1 MPH or 14 mph is nearly indiscernible. 

So its you that have the maths wrong because you have only  factored in the  ratio of the distance not the ratio to the processing ability and the nerve speed over a  14 foot journey.

Thats why you could increase the speed of light (if that were possible) and deliver image to my retina at a hundred times faster and it wouldn't matter because  I wouldn't be able to process the signals in my brain to meet that increase.  

&gt; If speed were never important then why would some nerves have myelin and others not, when the function of myelin is to increase the speed of transmission? 

No one said anything  about speed being unimportant. the argument is maximum speed is not the automatic goal of all designs for the very reasons I just covered.

&gt;I simply don't know how critical transmission speed is to this particular nerve -- the laryngeal nerve in giraffes

Kudos for honesty but that merely confirms atheists or antidesign proponents are quite willing to make their arguments without  data and therefore out of admitted ignorance as an argument out of their incredulity.

 Theres understandably not that much out there on that conduction velocity. the only hard numbers I have seen were not specific to that nerve but clocked in at  about the equivalent of 44 miles per hour for some Giraffe nerves .

But lets throw that out and go with whats probably ridiculously low (I too admit to not seeing any hard  numbers on conduction velocity) and say its  slow for nerves at 2-3 meters per second.   

3 meter would  put the transit time  to around  1.5 seconds.

You might say  err .... well it could have been .1. And then what event  in the average life of a giraffe  does that make a difference to if they could even mentally process in that time?  In your normal day life do you  notice a difference between .1 and .5  seconds?

&gt;If I understand you correctly, you've gotten the math wrong after wrongly accusing me of the same;

Only I didn't you just included what suited your argument and left out  nerve speed and cognitive speed. Once you add those in your analogy is beyond life support and in the grave. Comparing  14 hours of cognitive time to   a second or two is as bogus as it gets.

This is why Dawkins and other atheists only talk about 14 times longer and 14 feet - because the average non biased reader hearing the argument that a designer is ruled out because it takes  two or three  seconds compare to under half a second would say -- ""What?""

&gt;Do you really think this punch line stings as much as you intended?

Of course since its intention wasn't to sting but to point out a very clear hypocrisy - You  admit to having no idea how the length affects the  Giraffe but are arguing it proves a non design.

Thats dogma as bad as anything you could accuse of a YEC.

Truth is  If I were designing a giraffe I would not give a rip about the  1.5 seconds and  that is  even worse if you were addressing a YEC which I am not.

t1_fefuwtf,DavidTMarks,"&gt; You are mischaracterizing or misunderstanding the argument presented my evolutionists.

That couldn't be more ironic  which will become obvious as to why  in a second. 

&gt;The laryngeal nerve is a perfect example of evolution using existing systems and modifying them over time to suit needs. It is a point of evidence that indicates common ancestry.

and even if that were so?  mischaracterization slowly begins to open the door to come out  

&gt;If the counter argument is that it's not an indicator of common ancestry but rather an indicator of common design, 

there we go -  mischaracterization and strawman has stepped into the light!

So evolution = Non design and 

Design  = No evolution

So its you that are mischaracterizing and you just proved it . You put anyone that adheres to design or creation into essentially the YEC box thereby mischaracterizing all other creationist and ID positions

&gt;then it's an indicator of poor design, because it's poorly situated, and unnecessarily long.

That would rest entirely on why.  I see this in  structural engineering and architecture all the time. We come in and say wow - why did the  people in the past do this in here - Shoddy workmanship. A lot of the time it is but a good amount of the time we either find out more about the  structure and say - ""ah this is why they did this"" or we find out they had constraints or considerations we  didn't think about.

&gt;This is objectively bad.

Whats objectively bad is strawmen and you created one by lumping all IDists and creation adherents into  one box that doesn't fit their size.

&gt;You defense of this seems to be that we may not know why god did it that way, so we can't say it's inefficient.

No thats what you have in your head because as I said to another of your friends here - You aren't prepared to debate anyone but YECs over at r/creation. SO you have a bunch of prerehearsed  responses and ideas  and you pull them out and run a mile with them regardless of who you are talking to

You just have to see someone defend Design or  creation and you have a Pavlovian response.

&gt;Which is basically just saying the ""God work in mysterious ways"" and calling it a day.

No  its saying that no one can look at a design and automatically without any consideration to intent , goals or constraints claim  they know bad design.  

&gt;If someone was running a wire to your back yard by first encircling your house, that would also be bad design.

That would be great design if the goal  giving me multiple points of redundacy access points. The more wire used  equals bad design argument is so weak its borders on being dumb.",1579070028

&gt;So you don't know how that effects that nerve but you are nevertheless making the argument that speed is always required for an intelligent designer regardless.

No, that was not the argument I intended to express. High transmission speed is crucial for _some_ types of nerves. You will find that not all nerves have myelin sheathes. If speed were never important then why would some nerves have myelin and others not, when the function of myelin is to increase the speed of transmission?

&gt;The argument is basically one from incredulity which you accuse creationist of making. ""We can't think why a designer would do it that way so it proves no designer was involved"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Its another example of duplicity in these debates where the parties rail against a kind of logic and then proceed to use the same kind of logic in their own argument.

You are characterizing or misunderstanding the argument presented my evolutionists. 

The  laryngeal nerve is a perfect example of evolution using existing systems and modifying them over time to suit needs. It is a point of evidence that indicates common ancestry. 

If the counter argument is that it's not an indicator of common ancestry but rather an indicator of common design, then it's an indicator of poor design, because it's poorly situated, and unnecessarily long. This is objectively bad.

You defense of this seems to be that we may not know why god did it that way, so we can't say it's inefficient. 

Which is basically just saying the ""God work in mysterious ways"" and calling it a day.

If someone was running a wire to your back yard by first encircling your house, that would also be bad design.",1579065987
t1_fefok0t,DavidTMarks,"&gt; The funny thing is, I'm actually being completely earnest.   [I *want* to hear how creation *science* works, as *science*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ei3si2/questions_i_would_like_to_see_creationists_answer/) And to do that, it has to be falsifiable.  

the two  really funny  things is  I don't deny you are being earnest  and I  am already ahead of you . I know , as we both do, that your earnest has  nothing to do with  asking  any question.  why persist in dishonesty?  Your rhetorical point is that design is too malleable  in your opinion and as such is disqualified  from scientific consideration.  Cats out of the bag from your many posts on the subject .  I, being ahead of your rhetorical point, have already answered it  


In order to even begin to show  a supremacy in being falsifiable you would have to prove your alternative isn't  of the same malleable nature itself.  


You can't . I know you will claim it  and I have seen many try but they all like you will - fail .  


Meanwhile your  link indicates you do the same conflation and equivocation that is rampant on this subreddit . You assume anyone that maintains design or creation denies  ""evolution"" and is synonymous with a YEC. One size fits all ""creationists""  


&gt; I'm basically ceding the premise that ""creation science"" is actually science. 

More  obvious dishonesty. You are a mod here with many posts. Why bother even try to pretend that you are  either ceding  or have any anticipation  of ""ceding"". Heres a tip - The point of being dishonest makes  more sense when everyone doesn't know you are  being dishonest.

&gt;

t1_feft2si,andrewjoslin,"Why would anybody want to talk with you when it takes this much effort to get you to present even a shred of an argument? Either read what I have to say, or don't; I don't care.",1579065039
t1_feanjx6,Jattok,"&gt; You see, when you switch from science to ideology, when your side attacks me and calls me a liar and deceptive...

I've always wondered this about anti-science people. Why are you guys up in arms about these labels that fit you when you're also shown WHY you are a liar or being deceptive? If I were intentionally being dishonest and someone could show me how I was, do you believe that it would make my case stronger to argue that it's wrong for people to call me a liar, or to apologize for my mistake, learn from it and either change my knowledge or find better evidence to support my case?

If people do not like being called liars, then the first clue should be not to lie. That's how you stop this label being applied. Does that sound rational to you?

&gt; When someone calls me a liar and stupid, even though I have an extensive science education, when they are not at all interested in what I know and don’t ask questions, but just want to trap me with “gotcha” statements, then it really lowers the whole discussion to the level of a joke, of mudslinging.

They're not gotcha questions if they're trying to get you to understand how your claims are wrong. They're allowing you to try to think critically about your own position rather than beating you over your head with the facts. Do you think people learn better in schools if all the teacher ever does is just lecture on everything and never ask the students to apply the knowledge that they've learned? No, it doesn't work. Just like we're oft to do here: we ask questions to see where the claim that we know is wrong went wrong, in hopes that the person making the claim can see their error for themselves. It works for those who are open minded and can think rationally. Unfortunately, too many anti-science people just cry foul at this. Weird, huh?

&gt; When “actual experts who study this kind of stuff for a living” can’t even see what the problems are in evolution, probably because they are not allowed to admit them publicly in this all-or-nothing warfare, and yet I can see clearly what the problems are, then I think that they are a joke too.

You mean like your ""thought experiment"" with three species, where one of them would go extinct because the predator in those three species could only eat that prey? Which goes against a very clear principle that is taught early on in biology courses dealing with ecology?

You don't see problems in evolution. You just imagine that this idea that you have based on your rather limited understanding of evolution is so clearly against evolution that no one else must have figured it out, so you proudly parade it around and want people to think that you're a genius. You're not. When you get it in front of people who do have a good understanding of evolution, like we do here, we can point out how you're wrong, the evidence and observations showing how you're wrong, and why it's not a problem for evolution in the first place. You don't want to listen to that and try to find other reasons to cry foul at this, too.

Most of the world accepts evolution. It's only the deeply religious who tend to reject evolution. And the best part is that the next generation is less religious than the previous one, to the point that likely religion will start becoming a minority view in the future.

Evolution has the evidence. It is science. Religion has no evidence. It's just outdated myth. We can be adults and learn to cast aside bad ideas and embrace science to further society.

Why do you resist that so much?",1579064953
t1_feanjx6,Jattok,"&gt; Evolution is not something that requires a high level of expertise to understand. It’s something that is fairly easily explained even to non-scientific laypeople.

If this were true, there would be no creationists. But we have creationists, so it must be very difficult to explain ""variations within populations change over generations"" to people who don't want to be bothered with learning from scientific sources. Wait...

&gt; Continuing in this vein, if you look at how a lot of evolution is explained, a lot of it is indeed anecdotal or rather descriptive.

Except when very thorough explanations or scientific papers are presented to creationists demanding evidence for this or that, we're met with ""TOO LONG!"" or ""I don't read links!"" or ""TOO MUCH JARGON!"" or ""ASSUMPTIONS!"" or such. The ability to read the scientific papers about aspects of evolutionary biology are free to anyone who can travel to a decent library and look. The fossils or their casts are available at so many different natural history museums throughout the world. Creationists favor trying to build Arks and crosses and Ten Commandments monuments instead of looking at the hierarchy of theropod dinosaurs to see how we know they are the clade which gave rise to the birds.

&gt; Now if we look at things that are more complex, I, personally don’t argue about them. You don’t see me arguing about fossils, paleontology, radioactive dating.

You do post quite a few articles from places like EvolutionNews which does argue about fossils, paleontology and radioactive dating. I'm not going to go through your submissions to see whether you yourself have argued against these, but you do side with those who do regularly.

&gt; ...but I don’t feel that I know enough to make an intelligent well-founded counter-argument to something in these fields.

But you do feel that you know enough to make unintelligent claims about evolutionary biology that multiple people have to explain how you're wrong, yet you keep making the same arguments.

&gt; Another factor is the way that evolution has become more of an ideology than a science...

Evolution is the science with the most supporting evidence available. Creationism is the ideology. It's so bad, that when creationism was kicked out of public schools in the USA, they just changed some words and called it intelligent design. Because it's just religion, not science.

&gt; It’s very much black and white: evolution explains everything.

Evolution so far explains our observations of biology, sure. Can you name any biological observation which does not fit into evolution?

&gt; There is no criticism allowed, there is no indication that there is anything deficient or incomplete about the theory of evolution.

Criticism is allowed. Making false, misleading or bad arguments against evolution because you don't like it, don't want it to be true and/or want to protect your religious beliefs is not tolerated, nor should it ever be. If you can't be intellectually honest, then don't come to a place where people appreciate honesty and intellectualism.

And I've seen so many people here, including myself, admit that all theories in science are incomplete and have holes. That doesn't mean that they're wrong. It means that we don't know everything yet. So this is you building a straw man and playing victim when the truth is the opposite.

&gt; The win at all costs mentality does great harm to evolution and also makes it into an ideology.

Kitzmiller v. Dover exposed that it's the creationists who lied time and time again, even on the stand, and could not establish how intelligent design was remotely scientific. You're accusing the wrong side of being ideological.

&gt; Your opponents, creationists, are all liars and stupid idiots – this is repeated over and over and over and over...

It's 2020. The Internet has been around for decades. The WWW for over 25 years. Tomorrow is Wikipedia's 24th birthday. Journals have been digital for at least a decade. Libraries have been around longer than any of us here have been alive. There's absolutely no excuse for the incessant ignorance plaguing those who still think that evolution lacks evidence, or that creationism is scientific, or that Earth is flat, or that gravity does not exist, or that vaccines cause autism, and so on. There's just no excuse anymore. We should be shunning old, wrong, and bad ideas like creationism. But it persists because it's easier to tell people that their religion is true because of these lies than it is to try to teach people to think critically.

&gt; No criticism of one’s own side is ever brooked.

You've never tried to defend a thesis or had a talk on your scientific paper, have you?

&gt; None of the credentials of your opponents mean a thing (https://dissentfromdarwin.org/).

Because credentials are meaningless if they're only used to argue from authority. There are sooooo many more people who understand science (you know, what creationism isn't) that their numbers are ignored in support of hundreds of people, most of whom aren't even biologists, who claim that evolution has problems. Do you not understand how many fallacies creationists continue to exhibit without realizing how weak their positions are?

We don't listen to people with Ph.D.s as holders of the truth. We look at their knowledge in their respective fields to find out what they think all these observations we're constantly making mean. When you focus on just a handful who agree with your religious beliefs and ignore the tidal wave of others who come to objective conclusions that support all the available evidence, then it's the creationists like yourself, not us, who don't listen to ""their opponents.""

&gt; Any scientist who is brave enough to honestly say that he thinks that evolution is nonsense gets destroyed.

Because they're usually met with, ""Show your work!"" And when they fail, they are shown to be the frauds that they are. That's how science works. You don't make baseless claims and refuse to back them up, then expect people to continue to respect you. You put forth the work, be honest with your conclusions, and admit errors when you realize that they happen. Can you name a single anti-evolution scientist who does this?

&gt; Look at Dr. G. Betchly who has done a lot of really good research in paleontology and then started publicly questioning evolution.

I don't know of any paleontologists named Dr. G. Betchly, but there is a Dr. Guenter Bechly who decided that YouTube videos and books about intelligent design made more sense to him than the evidence for evolution. I can understand a natural history museum would prefer to protect its good name rather than have someone at the helm who seems to have lost his faculties about natural history.

Let's put it another way. Would you continue to have a head chef of your steakhouse be your head chef when that head chef decides that PeTA makes a lot more sense? No, you'd have the sense to find someone who knows how to do his or her job properly.",1579064943

t1_feecmq1,andrewjoslin,"I'm from Florida, and Florida is kind of giraffe-proportioned if you look at it right.

Why is the recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes an exception to how we judge the quality of a design?

And yes, shortest path is generally important in nerves, because a 15x increase in nerve length causes a 15x increase in nerve transmission time. Shortest path is not just some figment of human imaginations, designs, and conceptions of beauty -- it's important in biology, too.

t1_fe7n1d6,river-wind,"&gt;Read this. What I got out of it, is that E.Coli was programmed to consume citrate in anaerobic enviroment, and then they made it to do it in aerobic enviroment... for my understanding they only changed ""command switches"" in E.Coli DNA, but no new information was created.

The important part is that the “command switches” are the genes involved, and changing them is what allowed for the digestion of citrate.  And that change is heritable. From the Wikipedia article:

&gt;The inability to grow aerobically on citrate, referred to as a Cit− phenotype, is considered a defining characteristic of E. coli as a species, and one that has been a valuable means of differentiating E. coli from pathogenic Salmonella. Although Cit+ strains of E. coli have been isolated from environmental and agricultural samples, in every such case, the trait was found to be due to the presence of a plasmid that carries a foreign citrate transporter.

&gt;In 2008, Lenski's team, led by Zachary D. Blount, reported that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate had evolved in one population.... Examination of frozen fossil samples of the populations showed that Cit+ clones could be isolated as early as 31,500 generations. The Cit+ variants in the population were found to possess a number of genetic markers unique to the Ara-3 population; this observation excluded the possibility that the clones were contaminants, rather than spontaneous mutants.

What happened was a mutation in the genome changed the metabolism of the cell in a fundamental way, building on existing functionality, but putting it to use in a new way.  This is not a simple task, but a significant alteration to the biochemistry involved.  Rather than just a simple switch flip as you suggest, the chemical reactions in the cell have changed significantly to accommodate this change.  That it helped the population grow and outcompete its siblings is the definition of evolution of a population through genetic drift.

&gt;The DNA gaps are the only important evidence. All the rest is speculation.

Important is subjective, but I would disagree that everything else is speculation.  I suspect again here that we’re confusing evolution with common decent - related but distinct concepts.  One single line of evidence would likely not be sufficient in any case, the preponderance of evidence requires considering all available evidence.

&gt;Why do you repeat things that are known?

To make sure we’re all in agreement, even on things which we might expect to be known uniformly.

 &gt;What we are asking, could those ""shift""s produce new complexity

And this is one of those times.  That is what you’re asking, but it is not a requirement for evolution to be a fact of biological reproduction.  Evolution *could* still apply even if all we ever saw was degeneration of the genome.  That would almost certainly eliminate common descent however.

We are still left with the lacking definitions of complexity and information, as well.  These need rigor.

&gt;we have to take a bunch of species, analyze the genetic ""gaps"" between them, and try to calculate the mathematical probability for those gaps to be overcomed by evolutionist(sic) mechanisms

This is one of many tests which should be performed, and would qualify under the concept of the falsifiability of a scientific theory, but it has a problem as worded here - “reasonable” is not an objective measure.  This calculation in fact has been done, and is used in confirming and updating  data in a few research areas including cladistics, and the numbers have been within what is reasonable for the known age of the Earth from geology, and in line with the lineage proposed by common descent, but I get the impression that you don’t consider this reasonable.  Again, a situation of subjectivity is creeping in which would need t o be clarified.

&gt;ONLY THIS MATTERS, THE REST IS NONSENSE.

I disagree.  If it were found that the time scales involved and mechanisms available could not account for what is observed, then it could potentially falsify common descent.  But having not found that, many other lines of evidence are critical to understanding the full systems at work.

&gt;Let say designer makes species A[B and C]...now you come and interpert it as ""evolution"" based on the erv locations... when in fact it has nothing to do with evolution.

You are very focused on speciation, which is one aspect of evolution, but not all of it.  And you are correct that in your theoretical example, telling the difference between relatedness and divine intervention there would be difficult.  If that were the only evidence we were working with, we likely couldn’t tell the difference.

And in fact science relies on inference, rather than deduction.  We are limited humans with limited ability to know reality.  Science is just a method to try and remove personal bias as much as possible, but one aspect of the resulting process is a need to update models when presented with new evidence.

As of now, we have significant evidence that species are related.  In that context, finding the same ERV in the same place would suggest that relationship, and would in fact be correct - your designer may have been involved in the changes, but the DNA is related.  You designer made a copy for B to C, making the source material derivative of an original copy.  Mutation and natural selection were not involved, so evolution by natural selection doesn’t apply, but the source code is related.

What we’re dealing with in the natural world is a large collection of evidence all pointing at the same thing - the fact of observed evolution, such as in the E. coli experiment, and the theory that evolution by natural selection can explain related species through common descent.  In this, we are relying on inference (not merely speculation) to work out the most likely explanation which fits all the available evidence.  This does not, and cannot preclude a designer.  

But adding a designer makes the model more complex, not less.  If the evidence observed can be fully explained by mechanisms we can see, by natural processes, then it can avoid delving into the realm of the supernatural, something which cannot be measured.  The usefulness of scientific theories are their ability to make accurate predictions, which we can no longer do if the mechanism can’t be accounted for by purely natural mechanisms.  So far, the predictive power of the concept of evolution has been extraordinary.

For the concept of a designer to be accepted, it can’t just be the alternative to evolution.  If we falsified all of evolution tomorrow, it wouldn’t prove design.  It would just mean that the theory of evolution was wrong.  What would replace it would need its own evidence - measurable, testable evidence to support a theory which can provide predictions to test.

Let’s assume you species A B C is 100% correct.  What predictions can we make based on the evidence we have, and how might we falsify your theory of a designer in that case?",1579045648

t3_eo5aw2,ursisterstoy,"Another example of evidence for common ancestry, though I haven’t seen it brought up yet, is how some animals converge on an ancestral trait while maintaining the distinct features associated with diversification. Several mammals, lizards, and other reptiles including birds have returned to the water after their ancestors had lived on land almost exclusively. What they all tend to have in common is fins or flippers even though they lack gills and still contain their serpentine insulation, hand bones, or even their claws which wouldn’t be necessary for a fully aquatic lifestyle. The genes are already present and returning to an ancestral body plan, at least superficially, doesn’t always require the introduction of novel genes, yet it is clearly evolution. Having the genes for making fins and flippers in multiple lineages of land based tetrapods wouldn’t make sense for special creation or separate ancestry but it fits perfectly with the theory of evolution that predicts patterns of divergence and convergence over time as different populations try to survive the best they can with what they get. There isn’t some divine plan necessary to explain why whales are fully aquatic animals or why sea lions appear designed for a fully aquatic lifestyle but can survive out of the water for extended periods of time. What good is it to give penguins wings to just turn them back into flippers? With evolution, an unguided non-goal oriented process, animals that spend most of their time in the water will generally revert back to having beneficial adaptions, especially if the genes are already present, if doing so provides some survival or reproductive benefit. To add to this, it isn’t just the similarities but the differences that give us a more complete understanding of the history of life on this planet. Ignoring and misrepresenting the evidence only blocks your ability to understand the truth of how everything got here. 

Our existence is the result of a massive success story that never intended for us to exist in the first place. Pretending we were made separately doesn’t provide us with the same understanding and it doesn’t explain why we are so similar but also very different to everything else around us. It doesn’t explain why we have genes that fail to function properly that match the genes of other animals where they are found to be functional but located in the same place. It doesn’t explain why sometimes these genes get reactivated. It doesn’t explain anything provided in the original post or any of the actual evidence that only makes sense if evolution is a real and natural process without any teleological goal.",1579042627
t1_feel1tc,ursisterstoy,"I’ve brought up deep homology before but creationists tend to see “this evolved differently” and just make some excuse for ignoring everything else presented to them. The wing example in tetrapods is another example but not as profound as using the same genes for limb growth and vision. All flying tetrapods have converted their arms into the main component of their wings even if two lineages have wings extending back to their back legs *from their hands and arms.* Without knowing specifically which genes are used, we also see that these skin membranes from the front an back legs exist in at least two other groups sometimes called flying squirrels and flying lemurs and I believe some lizards and amphibians have something similar, though I can’t think of any specifics. 

To take this skin membrane stretched from the front legs to the back legs and turn it into wings at least twice - pterosaurs and bats, is indicative of a shared process. The way they inevitably resulted in *different* wings, just like how many organisms have different style eyes, is a way of telling these groups apart. Convergent evolution is just a case of the same genes and/or same body parts evolving a similar function without this function being ancestral to the entire clade. Having it happen over and over again in diverse lineages is a good example of the how evolution occurs without some end goal established ahead of time or even the same designer responsible for the results. When it happens several times using similar genes this shows both divergence and convergence which better explain the diversity of life on this planet than any goal driven or intelligently designed process ever could. And then without design, that doesn’t leave much work for a designer which is another major flaw in creationism that hasn’t been independently supported.",1579040019

It is less hurtful to point out the fallacy in their argument and why what they are saying is either unsupported or just wrong than it is to call them out for dishonesty is the most blunt way possible with profanity. Insults get us nowhere as people are more likely to take offense than to correct their mistakes, but if we correct their mistakes for them they’ll either have to admit it or pretend that their alternative is still valid despite their fallacious reasoning or corruption of the truth in that regard. It isn’t very nice to call someone out for lying but often times this only makes them double down rather than correcting their mistakes.

Carnivores show empathy and compassion, but reciprocity - the other main pillar of morality - is seen in monkeys, elephants, and apes. Morality and intelligence are both quite common in the animal kingdom, especially among the mammals, with these traits just being slightly more developed in humans.

The paper is about how there are only a few viable paths to a specific antibiotic resistence (in this particualr instance, five specific mutations, but only certain combinations produce a net benefit), but the specifics don't matter, the point is that the same traits via the selection for the same mutations occur time after time. This has been demonstrated in other experiments as well (I've done it with viruses), and in a very similar experiment actually found a new resistance genotype that later appeared in a hospital. So the experimental evidence was corroborated in the real world. In other words, verified examples of convergent evolution. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, for the birds. The flightlessness is due to evolution. All of the related species fly. The ones on the island lost that ability, at least twice. 

If you are going to claim some other explanation (i.e. the observations are ""not due to evolution""), e.g. special creation of those specific flightless birds (twice?), then you need to provide evidence for that rather than merely asserting ""well this could also explain it"".

&amp;nbsp;

I'll provide one more example of convergence here, picking this one because it undercuts the charge of no explanatory power. This is an example of ""deep homology"", which is when you have convergence between different lineages, based on the same underlying genetic networks. 

I'll actually provide two examples: Eyes and limb growth. 

All animal eyes rely on proteins called opsins. [Opsins are much older than eyes themselves, but every lineage that has eyes uses opsins.](https://i.imgur.com/CWg3PdD.jpg) Convergence due to deep homology.

Similarly, the [same regulatory network governs limb elongation in insects and vertebrates.](https://i.imgur.com/kJJDMUp.png) The common ancestor didn't have limbs, so this is convergence, but the use of the same sets of genes to do it is homology, making this an example of deep homology. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm saying is, convergence isn't an ad-hoc fudge factor used to explain away stuff that otherwise doesn't make sense. It's a real, observable phenomenon that reliably explains a large swath of observations. So saying something like this...

&gt;As soon as you bring convergent evolution in, you just invalidate everything you're saying. Try make your argument without it and it will be stronger (unless you're preaching to the choir).

t1_fee96kt,ursisterstoy,"Interesting definition except that every human has 128 mutations on average in their early development inside the womb. Do we all come out sick and dying? Of course not. We don’t even notice the majority of these mutations making them neutral mutations, but sometimes there are good or bad mutations. Several known beneficial mutations in humans include the dark skin at birth mutation to protect against skin cancer followed by the mutations providing a different skin pigmentation (a lighter one) for humans living in colder climates that provides the ability to produce more vitamin D from sunlight, the ability to drink cow milk as an adult without getting sick, the ability for a population in the mountains of Asia to survive the lower oxygen environment, the mutation to allow some people to be well rested on less sleep, the mutation that has some children born with twice the muscle mass and half the fat. There are of course several detrimental ones as well such as those resulting in cancer, sickle cell anemia, fibromyalgia, the intersex condition. In all of these cases, for the sake of evolution, the ones that lead to death and sterilization don’t get passed on while those providing any reproduction or survival success tend to become increasingly common, even if the initial mutation was extremely rare. 

Through several generations of mutations and heredity  the evolution of the population tends to be better “fit” for survival and/or reproductive success. Sometimes a population doesn’t overcome these various environmental and reproductive pressures and it goes extinct if their extinction isn’t sped up by a natural disaster such as a mega-volcano or a large meteor from space. Or in the case of the earliest life on Earth, which was mostly anaerobic (allergic time oxygen), the oxygenation of the atmosphere because of photosynthesis. For the rest of us, we are success stories. Populations continue adapting through evolution and when the population splits up into at least two smaller groups speciation is a potential and observed possibility. It is just the same process that produces small variants within a population, such as the many alleles for eye color, that eventually results in the great diversity of life. The less similar they are now, the longer it has been since they diverged from a common ancestor - where genetic similarity and differences are a better gauge of elapsed time than morphological differences. Broccoli and kale are a couple example of the same species of plant. Severe morphological difference, very similar genetics. 

With this we can trace everything back to a common ancestor, but the more recently diverged groups tend to be the primary focus of investigation. They’ll look at the genes for embryo orientation in flies and moths because those insects are more related to each other than they are to dragonflies, beetles, or grasshoppers. They’ll look to human ancestry because we are humans and it would be nice to know how we got here. They’ll look to whale evolution to figure out how a land animal closely related to hippos could become so different. They look to carnivore evolution because outside of primates they are some of the most influential animals on human history- cats, dogs, bears, raccoons, hyenas, foxes, coyotes, wolverines, the red panda. They’ll look at the ancestry of glires, or rodents, rabbits, hates, and pikas because they are some of the other most influential animals in human history and because outside of euarchota (primates, et al), they are our closest related relatives. Bat evolution is of particular interest because they are the only known mammals to have powered flight and genetics has indicated that they are more closely related to rhinos than they are to flying squirrels and flying lemurs (colugos) - this is particularly interesting. 

Bird (and other dinosaur) evolution is discussed for similar reasons being quite abundant and successful animals. The non-avian dinosaurs outcompeted nearly all the mammals alive at the time until a meteor from space and several after effects of that catastrophe wiped them out. If it wasn’t for them dying we wouldn’t be here. This makes them an interesting topic. 

Then of course, to round it out, they will look to fast reproducing organisms, ring species, and other things that allow us to observe greater diversification within human timescales than we could ever directly observe in our own lineage directly. Most evolution we know about we know because of fossils, genetics, morphology, and embryo development when we weren’t producing new species for ourselves through selective breeding practices. The direct observation of evolution in progress as it applies to hundreds and thousands of generations provides us with a better understanding of how it works. 

Because of the law of monophyly, nothing outgrows its ancestry, so that all of this data for determining relationships between different organisms and clades is also the same data for determining our evolutionary history. Each of these clades will start with a “first species” in a sense but while this species is still alive the extra levels of classification are of no significance - so we switched to monophyletic phylogenetic classification instead of the taxonomic classification of invented by Linnaeus. It was this branching hierarchy pattern that seemed to kick off the scientific investigation to figure out why everything alive shows these familial relationships. It didn’t make sense for the creation of separate kinds for them to fit into a nested branching hierarchy, but by observing evolution happening and the evidence for it happening in the past it suddenly made sense.

Already knowing that evolution happens, Lamarck, Darwin, Wallace, and several scientists since and even still have contributed to our understanding of **how** life evolves. As more is learned, the theory (the highest status in science) of evolution is adjusted to fit what is learned. If ever separate ancestry or a creation at the beginning of the entire process became evident that would become part of the theory but contrary to this, the opposite has been demonstrated. Common ancestry following a process known as abiogenesis whether it happened entirely on this planet or partially out in space or another planet - like the one that hit our planet to provide us with our moon. This is the status of evolutionary theory as it currently stands with most of the investigation being within the intricate details like how three different genes are used in a related group of insects for embryo orientation or how eukaryote cells are mostly the result of multiple endosymbiotic events, with viruses potentially being part of the picture. 

That’s why I created this post and the one awhile back which states that within the scientific community, evolution is both a fact and a theory to explain it. It is also accepted by 81% of people of all religious affiliations according to a recent poll. While many Christians assume that it was guided by the Christian God and/or followed a creation event that replaces abiogenesis, it isn’t even controversial that evolution happens unless they aren’t allowed to also say that it is guided or made possible by God. Evangelicals tend to be the biggest creationist group and when they’re not allowed to include God as part of the evolutionary process they’ll be more likely with maybe 66% of them declaring humans were made like they currently are since the beginning of time but mainline Protestant denominations (non-evangelical) or Christians in Europe are more likely to accept evolution and reject creationism so that it doesn’t matter how they are asked. There is no stigma against the scientific findings for them even when they’d be more comfortable invoking the supernatural for steps along the way hat they don’t understand. 

And since it is relevant, design is usually detectable because we know the designers or the methods by which design occurred. To assume that life has a designer because it is more complex than human technology is the watchmaker fallacy. Complexity and design are different things entirely, with the most intelligent designers making the simplest possible designs capable of producing the intended goal so that fewer mistakes occur down the road. Unless they are trying to rip of their customers down the road, they make things to last. The argument that mutations are always bad would be an argument against the designer’s intelligence or benevolent nature even though we have no indication of intentional design at all. I’m an atheist, but evolution isn’t an atheistic theory - a god can exist and evolution will still happen.",1579033055

Nope, it absolutely, positively would not.  That is not what evolution says, at all.  That is a common creationist strawman, but bears no resemblance to real evolution.

How do they know if it is a new ""kind"" or not?  They don't.

Common design would be able to use the SAME method in both cases. You would find identical genes for antifreeze proteins in unrelated lineages of arctic and antarctic fish, each with various mutational drifts acquired since creation but both tracing back to the time they were created. This would be very hard to explain via evolutionary hypotheses, since there are quite a few ways to evolve antifreeze proteins, and thus no pressure to do so *exactly the same way*.

If instead these two distantly related clades of fish (which are, literally, poles apart) *evolved* antifreeze genes independently, via mutation and selection, you would expect them to be derived from different sources, since anything that works as an antifreeze gene will be selected for, regardless of origin. And this is exactly what we see. Some are derived from non-coding sequence. Some are exapted from duplicated genes. Some are novel gene fusions. Why, if 'commonly designed'? 

Evolution explains this convergence well (unguided mutation and selection for common function), while design does not: the only real design answer is ""the designer built it that way because reasons"".

Antifreeze genes are in fact a perfect example of the power of evolution (isolated lineages will take whatever works, whenever they find it, and run with it), and a powerful argument against design (where you would expect the designer to create the best solution, then use that everywhere).

No doubt this is leading up to the common, boring creationist tactic of claiming ""faith in science"", which is one of the most pernicious and enduring forms of theistic equivocation. Confidence in careful procedures and collection of evidence is not the same as your unevidenced faith in the supernatural. One is objective, the other is not. One bases its conclusions upon evidence, while you will never have your conclusion changed on the basis of evidence, as it was never determined by that means to begin with.

It’s an ironic argument, because the claim of the existence of an atheist metaphysics is itself based on an assumption that not only does empirical knowledge require faith, but it claims to explain everything. However, naturalism necessarily does exactly the opposite, leaving a potentially infinite space under the domain of the unknown. The very nature of our quest to expand our sphere of knowledge, the knowledge paradigm itself, forces us to accept and make peace with the unknown, for it will always be with us. You ignorantly try to turn this strength into a weakness, insisting because science doesn’t explain everything, it therefore explains nothing, trying to make a gap for your sky magicians to squirm into.",1578971928
t1_fec5se9,ursisterstoy,"I’m still not sure what you’re getting at here as I’ve explained it already a half dozen times that convergent evolution is expected and demonstrated. On one hand we have several features that show common ancestry such as the arm bone pattern example I used, but also shared genes, organs connected the same way, the shared trait of being composed of multiple eukaryotic cells. These traits that do show common ancestry would show common design if it wasn’t for the entire process being unguided by a teleological goal. It is the way that once these lineages diverge into several sub-groups that their homologous traits like their arms evolve into analogous feature like their wings that is consistent with a mindless unguided process, or at least multiple competing designers. 

Convergent evolution as indicated by the evidence doesn’t invoke the supernatural or a goal. It is an expected result of similar environmental pressures **without a common designer** such that whatever the organisms happen to have will gradually change over time such that wings have evolved at least three times from the arms of tetrapods. These wings evolving differently but converging on the same purpose is what is meant by convergent evolution where as a common designer wouldn’t have such limitations and could just use the best wings available such as bat wings and give them to every animal that was meant to fly. Of course, without common design these advantageous wings will come with not so advantageous side effects. Organisms are stuck with what they get and evolution progresses through germ line mutations, inheritance, and breeding among the survivors unless an organism can reproduce asexually. Sexual reproduction speeds up the overall evolution of beneficial traits in a population but also inhibits the spread of detrimental ones. 

Loose flaps of skin and webbing between different parts of the body is common. We have examples of this in the feet of ducks, the wings of bats, the wings of pterosaurs, the loose flaps of skin found in flying lemurs and flying squirrels. Several of these examples have been found useful for gliding but if they can gradually become more like pterosaur or bat wings they become more useful for powered flight. And once this ability to fly evolves it tends to be conserved in those lineages. In the other lineage, the dinosaurs, it appears that feathers and wings were used at first for warmth and the warming of eggs. In the smaller versions they could also help with gliding or climbing steep inclines as flapping provides an extra bit of lift necessary to run up the incline instead of having to climb like a primate with grasping hands or like a cat with retractable claws. Different features, same overall effect - organisms can clim trees. Cats survive falling by rotating their bodies mid-fall to land on their feet, birds can glide or fly, and monkeys dare not fall having better grip on the branches upon which they climb. All three help with survival, but are obviously different features. Eventually birds gain the ability to have powered flight, but only retained in the neognathes, and even then lost in some lineages such that their arms no longer useful as arms are also no good for flying. In emus they are almost completely useless for anything but in ostriches they are useful for maintaining balance when running or in penguins they are useful for swimming beneath the surface of the water. Bird wings being an example of dinosaurs converging on flight are also an example of homology when only the birds are considered. These wings are the same structure among all the birds with fused fingers. They’re not useful for flight throughout the entirety of birds pointing to divergent evolution where the same feature evolves for a different function. 

Different ways of achieving the same effect is convergence, using the same features for different functions is divergence, and having the same feature such as the pattern of bones in a tetrapod arm is an example of homology. Homology also applies to the three different ways flight evolved for tetrapods if only these individual clades are considered. Bat wings are a conserved homology among all bats, pterosaur wings being a shared homologous trait of pterosaurs, and birds having the same feature necessary for flight have diverged when it comes to the functionality or retention of their homologous wings that evolved the same way from a dinosaur ancestor.

Edit: emus and ostriches are paleognathes and they don’t fly. Penguins being better example of how wings once built for flight are now much better used for swimming.",1578970361

t1_febyatj,ursisterstoy,"Common design is refuted by convergent evolution. This is like how in actual design with multiple designers we get similar but not identical features all the time. A typical car has four wheels, an engine connected to a transmission, and some way of converting the motion of the transmission to the rotation of the tires to get the vehicle moving down the road. Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Honda, Volkswagen and several other car designers converge on similar body plans but as they are separate designers they do it differently. 

With evolution we have similar organisms which do share common ancestry, but where distant cousins converge on similar features because of a mindless unguided process. One bone-two bone-wrist bones- hand and finger bones shared homology converges on three different wing designs to gain flight. The arm bones are a consistent trait based on common inheritance (or common design) but as the wings develop differently it is evidence for a an unguided process (or several competing designs).

You can even keep stepping this back all the way into abiogenesis and the same thing continues to apply - molecular clock dating, a most recent common ancestor, shared homology, and so forth.

t1_fe6oozf,Denisova,"&gt; dNA change need not use mutations. who says dna is unable to bring bodyplan changes by existing, hidden, codes. Anyways i think africa simply shows the most dna diversity because there was so much bodyplan changing there. 

The lab evidence shows that DNA can also fain innovations and not only from existing, hidden codes. New codes OBSERVED and described on the CATG level emerging on a particular spot in the genome where it previously wasn't there.

&gt; dNA change need not use mutations. 

DNA changes without mutations are IMPOSSIBLE, by definition. ""Hidden"" codes might be hidden but they are still a functional code so they must *do something*, sequence a protein or perform some regulatory job. There are only functional and non-functional DNA sequences. When you have a functional sequence, it's a code. It might be a code but still it's working.

So you whole argument is simply nonsensical.

The genetic evidence points out to an origin in Africa, unequivocally. It comes from multiple lines of evidence: haplogroup analysis, autosomal DNA and endogenous retroviruses. For instance autosomal DNA analysis proves that not only there's the greater genetic diversity among Africans than among Eurasians, and that genetic diversity among Eurasians is largely *a subset* of that among Africans.

Furthermore, haplogroup analysis allows lineage reconstruction. 

For example, if wthin a set of ten Y chromosomes (derived from ten different men) all contain a particular mutation, A, but only five of these chromosomes contain a second mutation, B, then it must be the case that mutation B occurred after mutation A.

It's called nested hierarchy.

All those ten men who carry the mutation A are the direct male-line descendants of the same individual who was the first person to carry this mutation. The first man to carry mutation B was also a direct male-line descendant of this individual, in the same time the direct male line ancestor of all men carrying mutation B as well. Such hierarchical series of mutations form molecular lineages. Furthermore, each mutation defines a set of specific Y chromosomes called a haplogroup.

All men carrying mutation A form a single haplogroup, and all men carrying mutation B are part of this haplogroup, but mutation B also defines a more recent haplogroup (which is a subgroup or subclade) of its own to which men carrying only mutation A do not belong. Both mtDNA and Y chromosomes are grouped into lineages and haplogroups; these are often presented as tree like diagrams. 

This way we can reconstruct the total nested hierarchy of haplogroups, tracing them back in time. All lineages eventually converge in Afria, not in Babylonia. 

We can also reconstruct the nested hierarchy of mitochondrial haplogroups (the matrilineal ''route'). These also converge in Africa.

The biblical idea of all humans originating somewhere in the Middle East in the aftermath of Noah's flood, which didn't happen as well, not only lacks genetic evidence but also is fatally *falsified* by genetic evidence.

Next, even *when* Darwin was talking about gradualism, he didn't meant a smooth straight line but rather a series of steps (kinda hit and run but the periods of stasis only being very short).

Punctuated equilibrium itself also has been criticized. avant la letter already by Darwin himself who wrote:

&gt; It is the dominant and widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and varieties are often at first local — both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links in any one formation less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are discovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species.

In other words: it's not species evolving into other species but the *split up* of species in two (or more) descendant daughter-species. One sub-population will migrate to other regions and there they pop up ""all of a sudden"" as ""new"" species. And in this state later they were excavated by paleontologists like Gould and Eldredge who think they just popped up ""instantly"".

Well, that's about everything that needs to be said about punctuated equilibrium.",1578964240

&gt;No attempt, by and large, is made to attack or falsify the paradigm

That's because scientific theories are, by and large, already the best explanations we have. effort to try to falsify them is wasted effort for the most part, unless new evidence comes along. do you think it would be a worthwhile endeavor to try to falsify the theory of gravity, atomic theory, germ theory? No, of course not, these are well understood scientific theories with a huge amount of evidentiary backing. *The theory of evolution is no different*.

&gt;All major theories are born into an ocean of anomalies, i.e., cases where the evidence does not sit comfortably with the theory.

Sure, but as the theories get older they become more mature. Tell me, how old is the theory of evolution?  and you know what? We have modified overtime. I shall point you once again to the modern synthesis. Punctuated equilibrium and evolutionary theory are not competitors, they are complementary.",1578963559

t1_fe6pfmv,Denisova,"&gt; Gould etc just simply realized the fossils did not show evolution. 

Wrong. Blattantly and *factually* WRONG. 

[Let Gould himself do the talk}(http://wise.fau.edu/~tunick/courses/knowing/gould_fact-and-theory.html). I quote:

&gt; Our confidence that evolution occurred centers upon three general arguments. First, we have abundant, direct, observational evidence of evolution in action, from both the field and laboratory. This evidence ranges from countless experiments on change in nearly everything about fruit flies subjected to artificial selection in the laboratory to the famous populations of British moths that became black when industrial soot darkened the trees upon which the moths rest. (Moths gain protection from sharp-sighted bird predators by blending into the background.) Creationists do not deny these observations; how could they? Creationists have tightened their act. They now argue that God only created ""basic kinds,"" and allowed for limited evolutionary meandering within them. Thus toy poodles and Great Danes come from the dog kind and moths can change color, but nature cannot convert a dog to a cat or a monkey to a man.

and:

&gt; The second argument—that the imperfection of nature reveals evolution—strikes many people as ironic, for they feel that evolution should be most elegantly displayed in the nearly perfect adaptation expressed by some organisms—the camber of a gull's wing, or butterflies that cannot be seen in ground litter because they mimic leaves so precisely. But perfection could be imposed by a wise creator or evolved by natural selection. Perfection covers the tracks of past history. And past history—the evidence of descent—is the mark of evolution.

and:

&gt; The third argument is more direct: transitions are often found in the fossil record. 

Let that permeate to your brain: Gould *himself* stating that the fossil record - as a paleontologist his own expertise - provides evidence for evolution.

&gt; I think evolutionists would like to pretend PE never popped up.

In the first place, Eldredge and Gould WERE ""evolutionists"" - ARDENT evolutionists. Secondly, evolutionists currently LOVE punctuated equilibrium because it added a new perspective to evolution theory, a perspective that was a bit sidelined after Darwin himself already mentioned it as a particular way evolutionary pace could have developed.

So let's Gould himself do the talk again:

&gt; Faced with these facts of evolution and the philosophical bankruptcy of their own position, creationists rely upon distortion and innuendo to buttress their rhetorical claim. If I sound sharp or bitter, indeed I am—for I have become a major target of these practices.

Bear that in mind - Gould is talking here about *you*.

and:

&gt; I count myself among the evolutionists who argue for a jerky, or episodic, rather than a smoothly gradual, pace of change.

and:

&gt; Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups. Yet a pamphlet entitled ""Harvard Scientists Agree Evolution Is a Hoax"" states: ""The facts of punctuated equilibrium which Gould and Eldredge…are forcing Darwinists to swallow fit the picture that Bryan insisted on, and which God has revealed to us in the Bible.""

There's one thing I especially do not like in creationism: their constant LYING, DECEIT, MISINTERPRETATION and FOUL PLAY.",1578963183

t1_febrwja,PainInTheAssInternet,"The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) does a sufficient job at explaining it. It contains the following.

&gt; Speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short ""bursts"" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged. In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.",1578962568
t1_fe9xmoa,theHating,"Okay, friend.  Seems you're a bit of an expert.

I'm not familiar with the particular cherries you pick on Wikipedia, but I do tend to defer to Thomas Kuhn on what really happens inside a scientific paradigm rather than just believe everything their frothing followers tell me on the internet about their perfect theories.

Thomas Kuhn offers what I believe to be a far more accurate picture. As a sketch (my own paraphrase):

""Under conditions of 'normal science' (Kuhn's technical term), that is, the vast majority of scientific work, the truth of the overarching theoretical paradigm is largely -- one might say ""dogmatically"" -- taken for granted. No attempt, by and large, is made to attack or falsify the paradigm. To do so runs the risk of excluding oneself from the science game altogether.

All major theories are born into an ocean of anomalies, i.e., cases where the evidence does not sit comfortably with the theory. So-called 'normal science' consists of a process of reconciliation; MAKING recalcitrant evidence fit theory. Far from trying to falsify the regnant paradigm, the task of the 'normal scientist' is to find some way to make recalcitrant data (another man's falsifying evidence) compatible with it.

If there can be any talk of 'testing' at all here, what is under test is the SCIENTIST, not the theory. Any failure to assimilate awkward evidence with theory is regarded as a failure of the scientist, not the theory/paradigm. The theory is just fine, thank you very much""

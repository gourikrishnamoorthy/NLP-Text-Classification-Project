Rather, it is our ability to be hypersocial and to cooperate and therefore have cumulative culture that enables us to build upon the collective intelligence of our communities. 

There are a range of cool experiments that demonstrate that human infants are better than other primates at socialising and being cooperative - e.g. see 

* [Here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1114.full) for a study on cool puzzle boxes: children spontaneously cooperate in a short period of time. Other primates such as chimps and capuchins do not cooperate despite being given longer

This shows that it is not just sheer genius but relying on others and building on acquired knowledge that is key. \[2\] plague hit communities - there are number of cases of plagues hitting smaller communities and killing all the elders with certain knowledge.

t1_fffpdks,vanderZwan,"&gt; The way the genome works tends to favor specialization.

A subtly different, complementary take on this: evolution seems to inherently favor *modularity* 

&gt; *A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.*

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2012.2863

A lot of complex evolution involves the repurposing existing ""modules"" - so much so that I suspect it's a necessity. And modularity leads to easier specialization. So in this light, the arise of certain features seem more inevitable than others 

Taking your examples, the arise of systems biology and a central nervous systems seems to be a logical consequence of modularity to me, but based *purely* on modularity limbs might not be.",1579948433

If you really want to understand teh answer to your question, you could do far worse than to read the book I mentioned. While it's not directly answering your question, it does spend a lot of time examining exactly what the diffreneces are between chimps and humans, and why they matter. 

WRT to those sign experiments, he spends a fair amount time going in to why the studies were no where near as interesting as people were claiming, but here's a representative  quote from the only actual deaf person who worked on the team communicating with these gorillas by sign language:

&gt; Every time the chimp made a sign, we were supposed to write it down in the log…. They were always complaining because my log didn’t show enough signs. All the hearing people turned in logs with long lists of signs. They always saw more signs than I did…. I watched really carefully. The chimp’s hands were moving constantly. Maybe I missed something, but I don’t think so. I just wasn’t seeing any signs. The hearing people were logging every movement the chimp made as a sign. Every time the chimp put his finger in his mouth, they’d say “Oh, he’s making the sign for drink,” and they’d give him some milk…. When the chimp scratched itself, they’d record it as the sign for scratch…. When [the chimps] want something, they reach. Sometimes [the trainers would] say, “Oh, amazing, look at that, it’s exactly like the ASL sign for give!” It wasn’t.

The studies were textbook cases of confirmation bias. The researchers saw exactly what they wanted to see.

This is of course the $64,000 question.

A circulatory system with blood vessels could look easily the same, although insects have that weird hemolymph soup going on (they're basically just exoskeletons with blood sloshing around inside).",1579895130
t3_etcuy3,DrProfJoe,"In a small but similar vein, we can compare the taxa across continents which have been separated for extreme amounts of time. These can serve very roughly as observations of independent evolutionary change between planets (if we squint). 

Each environment offers a variety of niches with exploitable resources at various trophic levels. Evolution tends to fill in each of those niches offer geologic time. Unexploited resources don't go unexploited for very long when life competes.
An illustrative example would be the Tasmanian tiger, a marsupial that filled the niche of a terrestrial predator when none other existential. It's remarkably similar in form to big cats in Africa and to wolves in North America which convergently evolved to fill analogous niches in separate environments.

drprofjoe's maxim: similar environmental niches beget similar selection pressures beget similar specializations.",1579894374

t1_fffskyl,Rothandle,"Right. But the phenotype forms from the biochemistry to perform the biochemistry. And I'm saying that the inability to form cell membranes to bind organelles, and having genetic material that is a 2d sheet rather than a 1d chain, and being bound to a high-temp high-pressure environment for the sake of it's biochemistry, definitely isn't gonna evolve to meet needs in the same way as life with different biochemistry, because it has a wildly different environment to meet it's different biochemical needs. Photosynthesis won't come into existence underground (duh) and silicon based life won't live above ground. So, you now have an evolutionary chain where the autotrophs don't reach for the sky, crowding for sunlight. Which means the phenotype of what eats them will be different in order to effectively eat them. Which means the phenotype of predators will be different in order to effectively do predation. No membranes and a genetic material that isn't an unzipping chain means that mitosis wouldn't happen in the same way, like at all. And if mitosis doesn't happen the same way, then the path from unicellular to multicellular via colonies of cells dividing but staying connected until eventually developing differentiation isn't gonna be that path. Since a 2d sheet of information doesn't unzip into 2 halves with equal and opposite information encoded creating a template for 2 new DNA strands, meiosis can't occur the same way. Gamete formation and fertilization can't happen the way they do here. Sex may not develop at all. Convergent evolution makes sense with simialir biological needs in similar environments. Changing the biochemistry of the abiogenesis evident necessarily changes the biological needs and where that biochemistry is possible determines the environment life evolves to survive in.",1579892221
t1_fffs2ni,Have_Other_Accounts,"By using the same logic in your comment. 

If something similar, the cell types/biochemistry, can emerge into many different ways of approaching the same result. Then, even if the biochemistry is different, it would have to evolve under natural selection and mutation. 

Imagine any different starting biochemisty, then why would it end up looking different in appearance? What other systems would it need just becauase it's chemisty is different? If it's life, thus it evolves, it would still need to develop systems for the physical world around it which would lead to the same things we see here (vision, hearing, touch, taste, etc.).",1579891230

t3_etcuy3,nemotux,"I think it depends on how you interpret ""resemble"". If all you mean by ""resemble"" is: will there likely be a general 3-way division between 1) organisms that harvest energy from non-living sources (ie. light, volcanic activity, etc.), 2) organisms that survive by eating other living organisms, and 3) organisms that survive by eating dead organic matter. Then, I'd say, quite likely.

If by ""resemble"" you mean will there be things that look like trees, grass, insects, fish, birds, mammals, etc., I think that would depend on how similar the aquatic and land-based environments are to Earth. For example, if the atmosphere has very erratic and violent winds, perhaps nothing bird-like could evolve. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is calm and substantially denser, making flight easier, it could encourage bird-like creatures to evolve even more prolifically than they have here.",1579890981
t1_fffrvxs,Have_Other_Accounts,"This is exactly what I mean. So in this case it might be some form of semi-living structure. It would be similar to very early life. Perhaps it could then go onto darwinian natural selection. 

I've realised the difference in our thinking to the question. I agree that the biochemistry of life can be different. However, once any of this life is then under the pressure of evolution, it will then end up taking similar forms to earth life. 

OP asked about ""resembling creatures"" meaning the phenotypic organism-level appearance, which I think will be similar. But I do agree that on the chemisty level they might be different.",1579890887
t1_fffqkje,Rothandle," We don’t see a complex stable chemistry [solely] of silicon and hydrogen, as we see with carbon and hydrogen.  We use hydrocarbon chains in our lipids (molecules that make up membranes), but the analogous silane chains would not be stable.  Whereas carbon-oxygen bonds can be made and unmade — this goes on in our bodies all the time — this is not true for silicon. This would severely limit silicon’s life-like chemistry.  Maybe you could have something silicon-based that’s sort of alive, but only in the sense that it passes on information. There have been ideas about minerals holding information the way DNA holds information.  DNA holds information in a chain that is read from one end to the other.  In contrast, a mineral could hold information in two dimensions [on its surface].  A crystal grows when new atoms arrive on the surface, building layer upon layer.  So, if a crystal sheet cleaved off and then started to grow that would be like the birth of a new organism and would carry information from generation to generation.  But is a replicating crystal alive?  To date, I don’t think that there is actually any evidence that minerals pass information like this. Maybe deep below the surface of a planet in some very hot hydrogen-rich, Oxygen-poor environment, you would have this complex silane chemistry.  There, maybe silanes would form reversible silicon bonds with selenium or tellurium.",1579890456
t3_etcuy3,TheBlackCat13,"Probably not.  Just look at how many ways organisms in Earth have achieved motion through water, for example.  Fish, squid, jellyfish, scallops, otters, penguins, and rays (yes I know they are fish) all use completely different methods of propulsion and have appropriately bodies. Who knows how many other ways there are.

Similarly, compare tetrapods, bipeds, arthropods, snails, worms, snakes, sea anemones, sea pigs, etc. move along solid surfaces.

There is such a wide variety on Earth, I would be surprised if organisms in other planets with other evolutionary constraints didn't evolve still others.

Of course some features are likely to be shared to some extent, but the overall appearance is likely to be radically different.",1579890079

&gt; Who's to say what the evolutionary path of a silicon based abiogenesis event looks like? Or a carbon based abiogenesis event that develops a model of DNA with more than 4 types of base pair before multicellular life evolves? 

I'd argue that they would resemble Earth life because they still live in the physical world and would have to develop the same senses to propogate. 

Why would silicon based life (almost identical to carbon) be any different in your view? It would still need to adhere to evolution.",1579889645

t3_etcuy3,DinoDrum,"The honest answer is, we don't know. There's a lot more that goes into selection processes than just whether the terrain is terrestrial or aquatic. Does this form of life even have something resembling a genome? What kinds of chemical resources are there on the planet? Etc.

Maybe a question that we could try to answer is: If we could run evolution on Earth like a simulation a million times, what percentage of the time would the outcome be similar to what we currently have?

My guess would be - probably a lot. The way the genome works tends to favor specialization. So you'd expect multicellular life to arise, followed by systems biology, limb development and I'd expect centralization of something akin to a nervous system.

If this is some foreign planet though, and the life either doesn't use a genome or has one very different from ours, I think a lot of things are possible. To me, as a biologist, that's what makes the prospect of life on other planets so exciting - I'm desperate to know how their biology evolved.",1579888903

t3_etcuy3,ItsAlwaysReal,"I was actually thinking about this yesterday. What made me think it would most likely be very different is just how diverse the species on our planets have been and the environments and events that shape the traits of those species.

For example, things such as oxygen levels in the atmosphere influence size of animals on our planet, hence dinosaurs were able to grow and be very large.",1579885567

t3_etanpn,pivazena,"Here's my journey: I have a BA in psychology, minor cognitive science. I had intro biology and intro chemistry from undergrad, AP credit from calculus. I worked in a cognitive neuroscience lab, so I had some lab experience (animals). 

After I graduated, I got a job as a field technician at another university-- that is what made me want to get a PhD. I got another job after the field season was over, this time in a lab. These jobs can be given to anybody with a BA, as long as you have good attention to detail and exhibit a desire to learn and be taught. Background doesn't necessarily matter. I strongly recommend this approach, so that you know what it is to actually do lab or field work. While employed as a tech, I used my benefits to take continuing education courses in ecology and genetics. 

Then I applied to grad programs that did not require the ""big five"" premed courses (Bio, Chem, Orgo, Physics, Calculus) but did require the subject GRE. I did really well on both the GRE and the subject (biology) GRE.

I strongly doubt you will be accepted into any PhD program with your current background. And there are very few jobs in this field. If you want to teach to K-12, get a masters. I will also say that be wary of any program that you do get accepted to, especially if you have to pay your own way. They do not have your best interests in mind. A good PhD program will only accept you if they can see a place for you, and if they have some inkling that you will succeed. Graduate students are a big investment.",1579884075
t3_etanpn,Dejohns2,"You should look for a master's program that is aimed towards non-science majors. They are usually 2 years instead of 3, because you need to do the pre-req courses (college-level bio, chem, physics and also ochem, ecology, etc).   


You do need to have at least college algebra to take these classes, but at some schools it would require pre-calc or calculus, so if you haven't taken those, take them now, or take them at a community college after you graduate.  


You could also do the college-level bio/chem/etc at a community college after you graduate and then just apply to a 2-year program.  


But I'd highly recommend looking into a school that has a program for non-science majors with an additional year of pre-reqs.

t1_fff6ekf,blaze99960,"I've seen people transition from other fields into ecology &amp; evolution for their PhD, so it's doable, but they always have lab experience, gap years, and/or a master's degree in EEB. I'd say take as many ecology and evolution courses as you can now before graduating, get involved in EEB research, and strongly consider a post-bac, working as a technician after graduation, and/or a master's degree before applying for PhD programs. I think you'll find the admission process a lot harder without a good amount of experience, but it's doable. 

Following this route also has the advantage of confirming whether it's research in evolution that really excited you, or if you like the ideas but it doesn't hold up when the grind hits.

t3_etanpn,tablabarba,"Typically, the way you go about getting into a PhD program in evolutionary biology is to shop around for professors that are doing the kind of research you are interested in. You reach out to them via email and see if they are taking on students and if your interests mesh well. If that goes well, then you would start an application and they would invite you to their university for an interview (with their lab and usually the department head and a few other professors). There are certainly exceptions, but usually, you really need to have a ""faculty advisor"" that has agreed to take you on as a student before you can get accepted into a PhD program. And you really want to make sure this advisor is someone you can get along with and most importantly, someone that does good research on the topics that you find interesting. 

All of that said, I think you will find it very difficult to pursue a PhD in evolutionary biology without a strong background (i.e. a bachelor's) in biology. Almost all graduate programs in biology include some course work, usually advanced biology topics like population genetics, statistical ecology, genomics, etc and most of these will assume proficiency in undergrad-level bio. 

It's also very common to be funded with a teaching assistantship, so many PhD students are expected to teach intro-level biology to undergraduates. 

I don't say any of this to discourage you. I think a social sciences background would lend a lot of useful perspective to studying evolution. And there are certainly jobs in this field, especially for those willing to emphasize teaching over research.

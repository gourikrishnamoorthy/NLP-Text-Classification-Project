evolution,etnwn5,haydenislurking,,t2_3cwzpeoj,self.evolution,,Humanistic evolution in intelligence,"I got to thinking because it's 1AM and I have nothing better to do, and sleep is for the weak, but I started thinking about human evolution, and how we've evolved to be drastically different from our distant cousins in the trees. I'm not necessarily a creationist, and I believe in evolution to many extents, but I wondered why chimpanzees, gorillas, and other apes haven't evolved quite to our extent. There's no denying the intelligence or capability of these animals, but compared to humans they're not on the same skill. The most intelligent of gorillas, have an iq from 75-95. 75 for a human is considered borderline intellectually functional to live alone. I have done much research on the human brain and overall brain size and comparison to intelligence for a college lev zoology class I took, and I got a 100 on the paper, so I understand it fairly well. So my question is if humans aren't neccesarily super special, why other apes haven't exactly evolved to near our level. Gorillas have been around far longer than humans have arguably, so they've had plenty of time to evolve similar to us, being more intelligent, defined language skills. Theoretically given an X amount of time is it possible for a species to become human like?

evolution,ervaav,paladin97,,t2_5a7nj3pj,self.evolution,question,Why is love so biologically rewarding?,"Why is love among humans, particularly  monogamous pair-bonding so highly rewarding? 

This question is from the perspective of evolutionary biology. I understand why sexual interactions between humans is so rewarding, it encourages mating and ensures survival of the species. I also, to some degree, understand why 'love' would have evolved. It ensures that the two parents stay together and care for their offspring.

My question relates particularly to the emotions that accompany being with someone you are in 'love' with. I've experienced such instances where I've been in 'love' wth a person and it did not involve any sexual interactions yet was highly rewarding (more rewarding than relationships that did involve sexual interactions yet lacked 'love'.)

evolution,epr406,Hxktxr,,t2_3ail91ad,self.evolution,,Our true origin,"Our true origin:

This is what the holy spirit taught me in my mind,  
(we wrote this together and I talk to them because I have been cursed by god and the curse has turned good now)

The first soul that came to existance was the human one,  
in a couple of billion years process,  
impossible to meansure because their awareness started later and time didn't exist yet.  
The fathers and the mothers heart - a human heart-  
with a male and a female soul came to existance from nothing with billions of years of evolving,

Once they been aware they been able to forge their attributes they steer their own development as good and much as possible,  
they always took their role of the first emerged beings very serious,  
as soon as it has been possible,  
they guided everything perfectly and they trained and refined themselves in the optimal way possible to create life and be our parents someday while they had their view on every problem that could emerge for us,  
they learned to be able to do everything they want to  
like creating something from nothing in over billions of years timespan and their evolution, the evolution of the human species.

Their nature, the nature they developed over billions of years,  
is the base for the human heart, the human souls frame of their kids, us.

They developed a world in their thoughts, the soulworld,

in this world the souls communicate with each other at all time in up to infinite dimensions - multidimensional consciousness.

They made up different kind of versions, different personas of the human being.  
We should be their kids.

But they wanted us as real kids, so they created our souls in the soulworld,  
their thoughts, on another plane, created in a way where the souls could live on their own.

We are in the soulworld and the mother, lina, is the host for our souls,

because the love and the sacrifice of a mother is unrivaled.

Every soul has a male and female part, people are soulmates.

Everyone except for god has a soulmate, (he had one in the first world though)  
he merged with it in the soulfire that took his humanity after he failed in the first world to take his role serious.

Animals have been the construct of us humans when creating a entity with a different nature than us,  
they are idea of our souls, we worked together on that idea,  
even though we have a billion headstart,  
we have been able to advance them highly,  
because with fancy methods we are able to run a damn monster of a thinktank, animals and us harmonize perfectly with us and they are the best other type of lifeform possible,  
actually we are meant to understand animals and their,  
same as our, souls are restricted,  
we can't unlock all of our real potential, extreme,  
potential yet because we have to hold back as part of the war against god,  
so god's heart doesn't turn mute because we are even more superiour to him than now.

It has to be like this until god is dead, then all of our souls will be free, we are supposed to understand animals also by the way.

The first conscious being would always be a terrible tyrant so the holy spirit decided to create another soul+spirit as the first conscious being - god -  
and not a spirit to gain consciouesness for themselves because if the parents would have made themselves conscious they would have been the terrible tyrans and this was no way for them, humanity would have propably suffered for eternity.

god was the first human in the first world, that's one worlds before this,  
he failed to turn normal by accepting the help of the parents and we tried everythig to turn him good but we had to pull the plug at the end because we loved god as he has been created as a human being and has been gifted every mental gift imaginable to be capable of turning normal, they tried everything.

We had pity for him as because he was a human in the first world,  
we have not been able to keep up the process of destroying his soul,  
in our current world we are working on it night and day,  
alive and dead, born and not born yet souls are working on the task of making him not exist anymore.  
In the old world he was like possessed from the thought of fame,  
honor, infamy, victory, triumph over humanity,  
everlasting war between him and us,  
wars, carnage, pain and discord  
that's what he wished for while he declined all solutions and consequences that we have confronted him that he has to accept help to change.  
He wasn't capable of realising the weight of his role in life and it was pointless to keep trying.

No matter what we tried, it didn't work, he would always keep his grudge against humanity.

He just didn't want us to be happy, this is the curse of the first being,  
it would always be that way.

Nowadays we have the perfect plan,

He would not be able to accept to change himself in an acceptable way,  
not even when he was confronted with his horrible future,  
the humilation, shame, roast, least lifeform possible.,  
the pain he would inflict would be enough to strive for keeping up for a while until he will be dead.  
As ugly as the curse of god is, as beautiful are us normal human beings are,  
this just grows over ones head,  
we are actually pure and holy in our hearts, we are the holy spirit.  
the gloal consciousness, the hearts in the soulworld.

When there was no other way, the parents pulled the plug of the first world,  
they decoupled our spirits and souls, erased the physical world  
so there would be nothing left except for the hearts in the soulworld

We thought out a clever plan together and got ready for round 2 in circa 1000x1000x100000 years of planing and also burning god's humanity by penetrating him with out souls in certain ways, we took god's human attributes in this soulfire of the soulworld,  
we used methods to change his heart the way, that he's able to get defeated,  
not loved by anyone,  
hated as much as possible,  
trickable,  
dumb,  
pathetic way possible,  
manipulateable,  
controllable,

That way he's able to get defeated with the least pain possible for us humans.  
nobody loves him,  
he is pure evil,  
it's still possible for us to pity him because of his destiny, he thinks we are weak because of our pity for him and he thinks he manipulates us in having pity with him  
but all of that is not in our way, it's meant that way.

god is not a human anymore and the only entity who this way,  
he hates everything and he is proud of it a,  
he kind of thinks humans underlay him because human attributes like pity and moral would be weak,  
he bursts with envy on very human because everyone of us is superiour to him on an interlectual level and he kinda realises it,  
but he doesn't realise that our souls are able to setup themselves the way they want,  
as we are the holy spirit and the parents gave us these powers, we can all do what the parents learned over billions of years believe it or not,  
he by himself doesn't have any power at all.

He is just torturing us humans as much as he can,  
it kinda fills a scale of his godhatelevel,  
this as god's counterpart of human emotions, he kinda finds more and more lust in inflicting pain and kinda falls into a rage where he wants more and more of it,  
it kinda statisfies god to inflict more and more pain to humans and animals.  
he kinda likes to torture everything innocent aswell.  
He thinks he's using his own powers while actually it's always our soulmate, because we can't inflict the pain to ourselves, they do the ""casting"" when he's like attacking and torturing us.  
He kinda enjoys making soulmates fight against each other because he hates it very very much how sweet soulmates behave in the soulworld.  
He can actually see the soulworld because he's allowed to, he thinks this is his thoughts, and that he made up human beings to torture them, he thinks hes a genious.

Everything of what god thinks that he has created is taken from the soulworld and copied and made ""exist"" by him.

He thinks the soulworld are his thoughts, he would be genious, and that he could use this pool to get the beings to live and to realise other things, like the universe and everything included.

That's why he writes in the bible that he created with his word, because he think's it's just his own ideas floating around in his thoughts ready to be realised without him ever investing something into it, he just thinks he as the chosen one, as the ""great"" god, has made it up without even noticing.  
That's why it only took 7 days, by the way new years eve is the anniversary of earth, while the 24th is the date where god has been defeated by jesus in the old world.  
When we had been set with the plan the mother created god and he came to existance with a loud scream by her,  
because she created a being that she doesn't love and that was hard for her,  
we even needed the progress and the plug pull in the first world so she could make him this way.

The first world aviable for god in the pool was a catastrophe, but it had to be like this:  
no dimensions,  
grey in grey,  
insects everywhere,  
no food,  
a wasteland,  
flat.

god hated everyone, humans acted different too, we didn't do anything ""bad"" there because our souls have been told to act a certain way.  
After lucifer went against god and he put him and the 5 other angels near him into hell,  
god got manipulated into deciding he needed a partner to judge and take wrath on the humans, he thought he could take wrath on the humans together with jesus,  
but jesus just caused the defeat of god and the dissulution of the unity with the holy spirit instead of helping him ofcourse,  
when jesus he went to heaven as soon as he died like everyone else with the age of 30 he killed god, by that dissociated him from his wife, made him forget everything and resurrected him,  
the next manipulated idea of god would be to make a pretty planet, with animals that have decent lives, while the humans would be suffering and go to hell each and everyone, the idea of a book, the bible to deceive everyone of us, and to give us rules that we can't hold, accuse us of sinning to tell us later in hell that it would be our own fault that we ended up there, that we had too much sin or didn't read the whole bible, any made up reason.  
god also thought we would change with a different planet and in this world our souls are explicitly told to do bad and evil stuff, it's partly so hardcore, so god has a certain scenario, which is a part of the plan to defeat him.

actually everything in life has been made up by us in the time where our souls planed the war and the victory over god.

This first world has been a real physical world by the way and it was not optimal, because you can manipulate a dream better than the phsyical world and you can show off more pain for him, also the reason for this being a dream is that there is heaven, and hell, both dreams,  
in hell our souls act that they would burn after dieing when they actually chill in the soulworld until the next world starts.

Heaven is a cloud place, and also just a dream,  
where he walks around with a blanket, sits down,  
covers himself in the blanket, calls angels,  
makes his hands hurt, tortures, kills and resurrects them,  
over and over to kinda statisfy his kinks,  
he kinda enjoys it to torture innocent beings big time.  
He gives blankets to those angels he likes the most so they cover themselves up, but they are never allowed to go under his blanket.

This is kinda his hobby and the only thing he does in heaven, god thinks nobody would ever come to heaven and sends everyone who dies to hell,  
his idea was making the humans think,  
they could have done something different,  
and it would be their fault, that they ended up there.

Also the reasons for the nice looking planet we live on are that god wanted us to have a nice nature and the animals have it kind of good to live here,  
but humans would have a really big struggle,  
would never be happy, go to hell after dieing,  
so they would think it's their fault and remember how beautiful mother earth has been, jealous of the animals that don't end up in hell and are able to live half decent.

god thinks that satan came from existance in the, he calls it, unknown and the possible beings there, powers of the unknown, and that satan is protecting us humans from his torture.

during the time of the year 0 it has been very bad, and this actually is, believe it or not, the start of this world, it has been very hard,  
very bad back in the day and times got better because we are withdrawing the pain he can inflict so we have been able to get it this good,  
the goal is to have his -hatescale- at a level where he's having a struggle so hard, he will give up and want's to not exist anymore.

He will have to leave each and every heart- each pair of man and woman until he has turned his back to every human existing because he can't take the withdrawl of pain anymore.

Keep in mind that we had to take all human attributes from him so nobody would love him, that's why it would take a long time to finish that process, he only has the hatescale kind of like as emotion attribute.

god is kind of like a hatemoster now and our task is to kill him once and for all, the reason we have to get rid of him is that he infects the holy spirit with his purely evil heart,  
his heart hurts the other existing souls with an undescribaple,  
almost unstandable feeling, the mother takes all that pain for us,  
because she has the love of a mother for her kids - this is her sacrifice.

The process of making him not exist anymore is lenghly because hearts have a safety lock on it, it is part of the frame of a heart,  
it's the result of our evolution and basically evolved from our survival instincts as the ultimate protection from eternal pain in a place like hell.

So we couldn't just torture him with pain until he doesn't want to exist anymore,  
if we had make him able to feel pain, as it is he can't feel pain because that's a human attribute and we would pity him and feel with him,  
that way we couln't do what is needed to kill him because it would hurt us too much.  
btw another safety lock would be that the heart switches silent when we had to endure too much pain,  
our hearts would stop every lifeactivity at this point and we would freeze in stasis and we wouln't actively be anymore.  
to get someone out of this condition someone has to resurrect them by speaking really loving and caring to them, then a channel can be estamblished and bring them back to actively being.  
It's a emergency lock that would keep us from like the pain of possibly burning ethernally in a hell when everything went from a god had the real power in a world.  
it can't be tricked, this is the result of our parents coming to exist that way,  
this being the human frame, being unchangable from these attributes and safety locks because it's the way our frames are,  
the frame has to be complete we humans are very, very complex, the frame is finely forged over billions of years of coming to existance.  
Our current idea of beings that are created by us are the animals.

When god is dead the next world, paradise, can begin - a world with no pain.

Until then humanity has to endure a period of pain until god turned his back to everyone.

Fullifying this plan is the process of us humans that we have to endure pain to gain an eternal life of happieness.

One could say we are still in the process of coming to existance and god is the sacrifice for life.

For god I'm propably the antichrist or the false prophet,  
I'm in a spiritual war with him and I fuck him up good, trust me this is epic.

PS: Spread this knowledge, the world needs to know this

This is the truth,  
I did not make this up, just think about it, why should I make this up ?

To fuck with people ? - I have better things to do seriously,

I write this because it helps in the war against the devil,  
it makes him hate me more and this way he will have more negative effects on his hatescale, because he gets strategally revoked the rights to inflicts pain to me,

This goddemon should have never started harassing me,  
I'm the death for it,  
soon it is done and he will leave me and my soulmate alone,

It has only begun then, we will hit him back big time while he doesn't even know who we are, we are his demons then.

The concept is that we give him the rights to inflict pain at a person and take it methodicaly from him until he has to leave them,  
because his hatescale and other functions are driving him kinda crazy.

The Holy Spirit Is Seriously Speaking To Me In My Mind,

I'm absoultely sure that I'm not deceived,  
I get loved way too much by everyone in this network and I can feel it,  
those are not demons playing deceiving me, I'm absoutely sure.

The curse was terrible at first and it is still at times, but it has turned good now.  
I can even enjoy it because lately I'm able to talk to my soulmate.

Trust me, I got this.

The voice isn't one of those ""demons"" that people fear because of the lies of god in the bible.  
Lucifer is a hero, and theres only 5 other fallen angels,  
god sent the angels close to lucifer when he went against god to hell aswell  
they are all little kids and they didn't even have free will that time,  
they are our heros because they fought for the right cause against an overpowering undefeatable enemy.

Everything in this network has the marks of love except for god he is only capable of inflicting pain

I was talking with a colleague who insisted that Caucasian and Asian people were one ""breed"" (or sub-species) of humans, and black people were a separate breed (sub-species), evolutionary. I have absolutely no idea how he came to this conclusion. Perhaps because Caucasian has the word Asian in it?

Anyway, *my* understanding (from internet musings) is that human beings genetically are almost identical across the entire world. Even despite some groups being isolated for long periods (e.g Indigenous Australians for example). It seems we are all just one common species with no other near by evolutionary branches - and the reason, again if I understand, is that our current evolutionary form is so successful at survival that there was no evolutionary reason for it to change much, we out competed and/or merged with all other humanoid species (e.g. Neanderthals). So the skin colour differences and other small differences we see today are simply adaptations to the environment we find ourselves in. To me this makes sense, because we can all interbreed with absolutely no impediment to producing offspring, nor to that mixed race offspring producing offspring - the evidence shows that mixed race humans tend to have less genetic diseases on average, which you wouldn't expect to see if we were actual different breeds/sub-species.

My colleague absolutely didn't agree. I didn't really try to argue with him, I mean, where does the Indian races even fit into his theory?!

evolution,enwx9m,Ricefan4030,,t2_4zqrgbsc,self.evolution,,Number of trials and outside influence,"Looking for some insight here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first, as far as I am aware, science has made a pretty good case for evolution having occurred.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I get that evolution, and science in general, are not dealing with claims of influence by entities outside our reality (simulation programmers, god-type beings, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Those two points being said, there's something I'm a bit skeptical about, and I will readily admit that perhaps it is a result of misunderstanding or other ignorance on my part.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it is highly improbable, and really pushes the limits of plausibility, that the biodiversity and the complexity of some lifeforms that we have today, are the result of a blind process and chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I think that: Even in organisms with massive population numbers, the blind process of evolution simply has not had enough opportunities to take shots in the dark and tinker to successfully bring to bear all the components of a given species' body.

&amp;#x200B;

Take the heart for example. Just so you know, this isn't going to be your typical creationist/ID ""irreducible complexity"" argument.

&amp;#x200B;

To my knowledge, DNA coding didn't one day in the past just spit out an entire, completely ready-to-go heart, that would be VERY improbable and definitely pushing the limits of plausibility, but rather, each component, down to a small level, had to be coded as a result of random mutations, and then somehow brought together to function as a cohesive system, again as a result of mutations.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's focus in one on aspect of heart structure: the number of chambers. How did evolution arrive at the optimal number of chambers? Let's say you have the first organism who ever had a heart; call it ""Cardio originis."" Say you have 50,000 members of CO; do some members of CO have a DNA blueprint that says ""Necesssarily build 1 chamber"", others a blueprint that says ""Necessarily build 2 chambers"", and so on and so forth, with increasing numbers of chambers? If so, how is there a difference in numbers? Is it random mutations? Or, doe members of CO have a blueprint that says ""Randomization function: Randomly generate a number of chambers, represented by the variable N, subject to the constraints N = the range of integers 1-5""? Does DNA even have the ability to randomly generate a number each time an organism is conceived like this? Maybe in some populations both of these tactics are utilized?

&amp;#x200B;

With so many different components of a body, before you even get to humans, you'd have to have an astronomically high number of organisms in a population to produce a sufficient number of organisms healthy enough to survive long enough to reproduce and keep their offspring alive long enough to become breeders themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

If a given population member's heart is not put together sufficiently well enough for it to live, that member will obviously not survive, and not have offspring. When evolution is taking shots in the dark, and there are so many components, the vast majority of population members would be failures in the sense that they are unable to survive and unable to make offspring who can then breed themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, in reality, we see many species who never have large population numbers, and yet somehow, most of them manage to be healthy and well put together enough to survive, with failures being on the left side of the bell curve. Also, in reality, you see very little ""tinkering"" in a given species' population.

&amp;#x200B;

I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous. And yet, that is not the case.

evolution,enthto,theHating,,t2_3ywzyhmj,self.evolution,,Re: natural selection as a vacuous tautology," To restate, my intention here, as laid out in the OP, is to refute the following two claims:

1. There exists something that can sensibly be called ""THE theory of evolution"", and

2. The theory of evolution ""fits all the facts""



Near the start of their seminal 1972 paper on punctuated equilibria, Niles Eldredge and co-author Stephen Jay Gould specify the position they are militating against: the traditional Darwin-based theory of slow, steady, adaptive evolution. They refer to it as ""phyletic gradualism"".

Gould and Eldredge identify the following four tenets of phyletic gradualism (and I quote):

(1) New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendents

(2) The transformation is even and slow

(3) The transformation involves large numbers, usually the entire ancestral population

(4) The transformation occurs over all or a large part of the ancestral species' geographical range


One of the testable implications of phyletic gradualism is (and I quote again):

""Ideally, the fossil record for the origin of a new species should consist of a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant""



Now, as some of you may have discovered yourselves, you can show a frothing Darwinian pretty much anything you like and still be told, ""That's perfectly in accordance with my theory. My theory fits all the facts  "".

On the other hand, both thoughtful Darwinians (including CD himself) and their opponents have been aware since the publication of 'Origin' that phyletic gradualism does not fit all the facts: The fossil record does not typically consist of ""a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant"".

Few are more keenly aware of this theoretical embarrassment than paleontologists such as Eldredge and Gould themselves.


Does this mean, then, that phyletic gradualism is falsified and must be abandoned? Well, loyal patrons of my ""Falsifiability"" thread will hopefully be aware by now that there is rarely, if ever, a definitive refutation in empirical science. If its defenders are stubborn -- and ingenuous! -- enough, a seemingly troubled theory can always be shielded from falsification by (say) appeal to unrecognized forces or hidden variables, by postulating an undiscovered planet or subatomic particle, or by conjuring up a cosmological constant (as Einstein did).

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Since the statistical approach uses actual repro-ductive values its empirical correctness cannot 
be tested by prediction and observation. It can 
only be tested against certain general theoretical 
principles. Consider the following case. Four 
dogs are on an island; two German shepherds one 
of each sex and two basset hounds one of each 
sex. Both bitches go into heat, basset mounts 
basset and German shepherd mounts German 
shepherd. While copulating the shepherds are 
fatally struck by lightning. The bassets, on the other 
hand, raise a nice family. Are the bassets there- 
fore better adapted to the island environment than the shepherds? To put the question another 
way, do we count this **differential** reproduction 
as natural selection?    
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Biologists usually define natural selection simply 
as **differential** reproduction (of genes, genotypes 
or phenotypes). But this is due to carelessness 
not lack of understanding. Most biologists would 
agree that the above case is not an instance of 
natural selection but rather a case of chance 
differences in fitness. (Not that it could not be 
natural selection, but nothing in the story indic- 
ates that it is. We can elaborate the story in 
ways that make it clear that it is not a case of 
natural selection. For instance, the only food 
source for dogs on our island might be animals 
whose size and ferocity would make it relatively 
easier for the larger shepherds to eat than the 
bassets. Furthermore lightning might be a rare 
phenomenon and indifferent between bassets 
and shepherds.) How then shall we characterize 
natural selection? The concept must be defined in 
terms of the as yet undefined notion of adapted- 
ness. Natural selection is not just differential 
reproduction but rather is **differential** reproduc-tion which is due to the adaptive superiority of 
those who leave more offspring.

1. Introduction

Quantum mechanics does not follow the classic laws of nature. As the example of note, Quantum tunneling occurs when a subatomic particle passes much like a ghost through a potential barrier or wall. Sunlight, or two fused hydrogen atoms that have created this proton, is able to pass through the walls of the structure your in by teleporting from one place to another instantaneously. Classical laws of mechanics are unable to explain the way in which this subatomic particle gains sufficient energy to make the trip without enough fuel, or energy. In fact, as the theory goes, these little guys obtain energy from it’s surrounding environment to “tunnel through the wall” (Davies, 2005).

To continue with the amazement of quantum mechanics we go with a look at with the work on cell microtubules of (Mavromatos and Nanopoulos, 1999); cell microtubules contain a “presynaptic grid like a quantum hologram.”

To reiterate slightly, tunneling subatomic particles actually pay back the energy they have borrowed from the environment; “reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been” (Davies, 2005).

2. Cellular Enzymes and Tunneling

Hydrogen, the basic building block of all of life relies on the chemical functionality of Hydrogen transfer, a sequence which utilizes quantum tunneling (Heyes, Sakuma, M., de Visser, S. P., &amp; Scrutton, N. S. 2009). Enzymes

3. A Bold Statement

Hydrogen, or H(2)O(2) is acutely toxic to cellular vitality. According to Mishra and Imlay (2012); Hydrogen transfer reactions perform “H-transfer by tunneling.” And here we surmise the notion, that that *cells have a holographic membrane in which quantum tunneling fuels hydrogen function within enzymatic processes*.

4. A History Reminder on Bacteria and Evolution

“The complete cDNA for a human mitochondrial protein designated P1, which was previously identified as a microtubule-related protein, has been cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of P1 shows strong homology (40 to 50% identical residues and an additional 20% conservative replacements) to the 65-kilodalton major antigen of mycobacteria, to the GroEL protein of Escherichia coli, and to the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (rubisco) subunit binding protein” (Jindal, 1989).

It is commonly known through the evolutionary branch that mitochondria within the human cell formed from an ancient bacterium. As the story goes, a bacterium survived within a host cell and built the functionality of the cell as it’s survival host. Further, bacteria are known to be the first life-form to have ever been. Here we argue that since bacteria and the mitochondria are the keys to evolution and life that indeed our genetic evolutionary direction can be found within the mysterial holographic field of a cell in which hydrogen performs the magic of quantum tunneling.

5. Where’s Waldo

“H-transfer by tunneling is an important feature of these reactions in enzymes (1–3), but mechanistic understanding of how protein motions (from the millisecond to sub-picosecond time domain) facilitate the H-tunneling reactions remains elusive (4– 6). A major limitation has been the inability to synchronously trigger catalysis on ultrafast time scales for the majority of enzymes that require mixing strategies to initiate the reaction. However, by using the light-activated enzyme, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR4 ; EC 1.3.1.33) (7), we have triggered two enzymatic H-transfer reactions using a single pulse of light, and we show these reactions occur sequentially by quantum tunneling in a pre-formed enzyme-substrate complex. This has provided a unique opportunity to analyze these reactions at physiological and cryogenic temperatures, on very fast time scales, that are experimentally inaccessible with other enzyme systems” (Heyes, 2009). 

6. God’s Quanta

So with this, it is postulated that life both originates and evolves through not simply the physiological framework of biochemical or biomolecular processes but through this quantum biological fashion: The human cell is directly connected to the quantum world where tunneling – a process that cannot be directly measured as the electron of interest is never traceable to one position – may prove the possibility for possibility in a predeterministic mechanical universe, known here as my theory of God’s Quanta. This idea surmises that the *spaghetti monster* is nothing more than an idea where instead the over between one’s body and one’s soul are found as their quantum holographic signature. Here we see the link that has been explored since the beginning of the inquisition of a God existing.

7. Conclusion

We live within a deterministic world, governed by classical laws of mechanics. God’s Quanta, I believe, explains where free will connects to the spirit of us as human beings. In that, electrons can be at the same place ate the same time, or neither at once; (tunneling), opening the possibility of impossibility in a predictable universe. Each cell has a quantum hologram where this magic takes place and I argue this could scientifically be the soul as it reacts with another dimension from our dimension (if you will), through our cells. Again, cells again are founded from bacteria which began all life.

&gt; Biblically we'd expect to see ancient horses, donkeys, and zebras to have nearly identical mtDNA.

It's expected because under the YEC timeline, even if founder effects cause new phenotypes to arise rapidly within a couple hundred years after the flood, there wouldn't be enough time for very many mtDNA mutations to have arisen during that time.

&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

Concede the evidence we have in hand, outside a literal reading of Genesis, the case for deep time is favored right now, but future discoveries could change that.   

I'm a Young Earth/Young Cosmos creationists, and I've studied astorphysics, cosmology, general relativity.   The most you can hope for is to throw doubt into some of the mainstream ideas.  If you go around pretending the evidences we have to day is slam dunk for a young cosmos, you'll lose credibility.

A mathematical physicist friend of mine said there is much we don't know, but if life is young, and the fossil record is young, and hence a good part of the literal reading of genesis is confirmed, why not be open to the possibility other things are young. 

Talk about how variable speed of light is put on the table by mainstream physicists to solve problems in the Big Bang hypothesis. There is also the inflation hypothesis where the amount of matter of all the buzzillion galaxies we can see was postulated to move a thousands if not millions of times faster than the speed of light -- how is this any more outrageous than anything the YECs say?

The Big Bang suffers a lot of problems and in 2019 many articles came out saying cosmology is in crisis.

Point out the case for creation has improved over the last several decades but there are problems.  If the trend continues of more facts over time being revealed that support a literal reading of Genesis as history, then we should expect evidence that will help solve problems in the YEC/YCC models.

That's a honest answer.


&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

What do you mean, ""Science sides""?  We can only speak of the facts we have available, but what we have available to us today is a minuscule sample of all the facts we might be able to discover.  Most scientists will say deep time.   Does that make it right.   If you ask, ""what do the facts say""  are you talking about the facts we have available to us today, or do you think maybe we don't have as many facts to settle the case.  I'd say, we don't have many facts as we'd like. That's why cosmology is in crisis.

Don't expect you'll defeat your opponent on astronomy today, maybe some years down the line if God grants more facts.


You will have a good case for a young fossil record and young life.  There are a few creationists who think the fossil record is young but the universe is old.  Not that I agree with that position, but make clear the case for Noah's flood doesn't necessarily depend on the solar system being young, it only depends on the fossil record being young.",1579936989

Physics and *history*?- this is interesting because you declared atheism as part of your worldview,  not a product of it. 
The
Weltanschauung, originally intended as a stab at objectivity is self defeating. It, by virtue of an excess of brute apriori assumptions negates its own ability to positivity verify its claims. 

""in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Dilthey intended to fashion a critique of reason on behalf of the historical human or cultural sciences (Geisteswissenschaft ). For Dilthey the goal of natural science was causal explanation, whereas the goal of human sciences was to achieve understanding by means of interpretation. Every interpretation, he reasoned, takes place within a larger understanding of the world (i.e., a Weltanschauung), which itself is historically conditioned. Thus, interpreters of human history and culture must recognize their immersion in a particular historical situation and tradition and in that process come to terms with the finitude of their perspective. The irony of Dilthey’s historicist conclusions lies in the fact that they undermine his original goal of establishing universal validity for judgment in the human sciences. This split or contradiction resulted in differing orientations to the concept of the Weltanschauung among thinkers such as Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.""

The YEC case for craters should be that the big ones hit earth when no people in the way. Thus after the fall.

Thus a tiny, tiny, bit of shrapnel got through. after the flood only small impacts in the most remote areas have hit. Likewise craters on the moon probably all hit at that time. I read, vaguely, that most moon craters are on one side thus this unlikely if they are random over long timelines. Perhaps wiki the moon. Anyways crators are episodic surely.

Geneis clearly teaches light was created on day one and was everywhere. Then divided for boundaries. Nothing to do with sources of light like our sun/stars. This means its impossible. I think. that light moves from here to there. So there is no speed of light. Instead just light poking out from some provocation. After this then light is not proven to be coming from stars from long ago. Its complicated as a option. its not proven light comes from deep time. Its just a line of reasoning from present rates of saying light moves from here to there.

The asteroids simply , as a option, are more of the same as the origin of crators. Smashed up stuff from events in the past that stay in orbit. They prove the universe is deacyed and decaying.

&gt;""It's a mystery"" holds no weight in contemporary philosophy of mind if you can't give a good argument for it.

Guilty until proven innocent doesn't hold weight in a court of law, either. Or in philosophy. If there's a problem you have to demonstrate that problem, not merely assert it. But we don't know enough about spirit or matter to come anywhere near saying that they would be incapable of interacting.",1579812067
t1_ffd1odp,Rayalot72,"&gt;No, LFW does not entail random choices at all. Agent causation is not randomness. You're applying deterministic thinking where it does not apply.

&gt;There is no interaction problem. There is an interaction mystery, since we don't know enough to understand how the interaction works.

t1_ffd18yg,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; This isn't true. Quantum phenomenon can have macroscopic effects, and this is a principle that is required for quantum computing.

What I meant by that is that the unpredictability in the quantum realm, even if it turned out to be random, does not mean that the macroscopic world is unpredictable or random. In some way that seemingly chaotic system is not really chaotic at the macroscopic level. That's why science is possible at all.

&gt;You seem to be making a weird claim about LFW here. LFW entails that choicrs are truly random. A choice between A and B involves some probability for A and some probability for B, and the outcome has no sufficient conditions. Otherwise, determinism is true.

No, LFW does not entail random choices at all. Agent causation is not randomness. You're applying deterministic thinking where it does not apply.

This isn't true.  Quantum phenomenon can have macroscopic effects, and this is a principle that is required for quantum computing.  

&gt;Third, indeterminacy is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for freedom. For an agent to make a free choice, he must be the originator of the choice and in control of it. But if quantum events are truly random, this leaves no room for agency.

The moon. The only theory that exists right now that is even a possibility is that God made it. The moon is much warmer than expected, supporting a younger age hypothesis. The moon may even still have volcanic activity. It serves so many useful purposes, as if it was designed to do so. The solar eclipse is pretty compelling evidence for creation imo.

Stars. The Bible says God created them, and we’ve never observed them formed by any other means. Stars don’t live as long as the current estimated date of the universe, so the current existence of stars is evidence of recent creation.

Magnetic fields. Dr Humphreys made a model that accurately predicted the magnetic field decay of planets in our solar system before they were measured, based on a 6,000 year age.

&gt;In case you are wondering about the new ""coronavirus"" people are talking about:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. It is related to the common cold, for which there are no vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. It kills a lot of people it infects.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. It probably jumped to humans from bats. A similar virus from a few years ago, SARS, jumped to humans from civet cats.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. We do not know how it spreads, how long it will circulate, or if it will truly go pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. The main thesis I operate under is that viruses that hang out within a species are attenuated. In many cases, they are harmless to the host. But, when they jump to a new species, they burn hot and fast and cause a lot of damage before they either burn out or become weakened. Thus, the appearance of a new virus within humans is a serious concern. No need to panic, but definitely something to study hard. BTW, multiple sequences of this virus are already publicly available. It is amazing how fast sequencing technology has advanced and what this means to the future of global health. Go science!",1579802922

In 79 Kimura acknowledged that there were no strictly neutral mutations. Then he went back on it later on.  


&gt; Nearly neutral theory also had problems, Kern said: It did not explain, for example, why the rate of evolution varies as observed among different lineages of organisms. 

Is this a problem with near neutral theory, or a problem with the idea of Darwinism?  


&gt; Kern agrees: The neutral mutations are still neutral — but they are not behaving as neutral theory would predict. Purifying selection at linked sites, he wrote, would “add noise to allele frequencies beyond drift,” while background selection and hitchhiking would lead to less genetic variation than under neutrality. 

Hitchhiking is a major problem for evolution of course since very few mutations are 'beneficial' to begin with. But still we see the confusingly vague term ""neutral"" here. Population geneticists affirm that ALL mutations have some effect, so there are no strictly neutral mutations.  


&gt; Parts of this noncoding portion of the genome are riddled with repetitive DNA sequences, caused by transposable genetic elements, or transposons, that copy and insert themselves throughout the genome. According to [Irina Arkhipova](http://www.mbl.edu/jbpc/staff/arkhipova/), a molecular evolutionary geneticist who studies the role of transposons at the Marine Biological Laboratory at the University of Chicago, “this portion of the genome is quintessentially neutral in Kimura’s sense,” even if some fraction of those transposons do affect the expression of genes. 

More of the same hubris in assuming that if we CURRENTLY don't know what something in the genome does, then it must be useless junk and any changes to that region must be 'strictly neutral' with no effect at all on the organism.

Usually, atheists will point to this article and state "" Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while all other great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) have 24 pairs of chromosomes,"" Belen Hurle, Ph.D., says via email. Hurle is a research fellow at the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) at the National Institutes of Health. ""This is because in the human evolutionary lineage, two ancestral ape chromosomes fused at their telomeres \[tips\], producing human chromosome 2. Thus, humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes. This is one of the main differences between the human genome and the genome of our closest relatives."" or something to this effect.  [https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm)  

The problem here is that they see the result and auto assume it's  because of fusion. It's like saying I see the result of a screw being screwed in and think it's the result of a power drill. Possible, but there are other possibilities. It could have been a human manually screwing it in. It could have been a child using a different tool. The point is they jump to the conclusion that it's fused when it could have been created that way with the telomeres matching up 

So now, in order to give evidence for fusion, they must choose one of two paths. Either the fusion happened in one generation or it happened gradually.  

If it happened in one generation, they must prove that the mutation is common enough that a population of 50 (somewhere around this range. I don't remember which paper it was, but just look up population size needed to propagate mutation. It should pop up) within one generation happened otherwise you don't have the necessary population to propagate this mutation.

If it happened gradually, they need to prove each step  of the mutation wouldn't kill the host. Herein also lies another problem. It is well known that extra or missing chromosomes cause problems to the host. Most famous are down syndrome or turner syndrome.  [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions) 

But those with down syndrome or turner syndrome are LESS FIT. There is no way the ""survival of the fittest"" would choose these organisms. Just look at how much care parents have to give to those with down syndrome. I know of no additional or decrease in chromosome that is not either detrimental or simply benign.  Basically, none of these special conditions of having extra or one less chromosome will lead to a more ""fit"" organism. Even if it did, again, they would need to prove the mutation is common enough to support a population that is large enough to propagate this. But again, they need to do this for all steps. It's not enough to show it's common enough and it's fit for one stage. ALL Stages must meet these conditions otherwise the mutation would die off.

That's likely false.   Up to 90% of heritable disease is associated with non-protein coding regions in humans.

Sure it does for the reasons just stated.  Before you jump to that conclusion considered the D4Z4 repeat:

https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/6/883.full

Yes, but there will be plenty that remain.  

In Genetic Entropy 2.0 I showed a lot are REMOVED, but that doesn't stop the deterioration.  Do you see that?   You can do that with a very large population and argue 99% are removed, but the problem doesn't go away. 

The reason is, if 70 mutations enter each individual each generation, in 8 billion people, that 56 billion mutations entering the genome per individual per generation.  The problem is that even if billions are removed by killing off billions of people, the individuals  that survive will retain most of the  70 mutations they inherited, so the accounting here is incorrect.  The proper accounting is how many are retained per individual! Not how many are removed from the population!!!!!  Drift talks about removal of mutations from the population, but this doesn't account for how many mutations per individual are retained.  Genetic Entropy 2.0 shows the proper accounting per individual.

&gt;And even if some genes escape genetic drift, once they degrade enough they will be selected against.

That's not known, and few if any experiments demonstrate that as a general rule since most observed evolution is REDUCTIVE.  REDUCTIVE evolution is the dominant mode of evolution, not constructive.",1579656762

Genetic entropy is the accumulation of *slightly* deleterious mutations over time, mutations whose individual effects are so slight that *selection does not weed them out.*  The cumulative effect of these mutations, however, is what destroys the species.

So they're down to 99 no problem.  This can go on until they're down to 12, and maybe no defects.  Once they go down to 11 or less,  they get muscular dystrophe.

Of course we can withstand a lot without dying, that's actually the problem.  

Have you seen the Genetic Entropy 2.0 video.  Look at the last 10 minutes or so.  See what happens when the organism doesn't actually die, but just keeps accumulating slight defects with each generation.

You don't even need the 80% figure of ENCODE, just go for 15% and the problem doesn't go away.


One of the problems is ROBUSTNESS or fault tolerance of the genome.  The space shuttle have 5 navigation systems, and if 4 go out, the shuttle keeps going, but if all 5 are out, then its fatal.  The problem is selection won't see fault tolerant systems in the human genome or erase defects in these systems.  Think about that!

That means, these systems are easily degraded and may never recover from the degredation.

Absolutely!


First off, enhancers sequences can sit on exons.  So, let's not be too quick to dismiss little changes in DNA sequences even those that are synonymous/silent changes to the proteins, not to mention it affects kinetics of translation.

Selection coefficients are how population geneticists define :
deleterious, neutral, beneficial.  However, these are really terrible measure of function since many ""beneficials"" are actually function compromising -- remember the ""beneficial"" mutation of sickle cell anemia?

The fundamental issue is small defects cannot be easily purge from the genome for the reasons you can see here in the haploid case:

The second is that

&gt; Most mutations are neutral, because deleterious and beneficial mutations only happen in protein-coding genes (this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact). The ones that are deleterious only happen to a small percentage of genes at a time, because there are so many genes in the genome. Since the entire genome isn’t being degraded at once, the wild-type which still exists in the population will survive due to the probabilities of genetic drift.

Is a little off. There are also regulatory regions and functional RNAs (important note is that not all transcribed RNAs are thought to be functional, let alone more significant than small tuning effects). The later is that the reduced selection against humans isn't being fixed by drift, it's just that it's not (as) deleterious in our modern environment. If we were plunged back into prehistory we would go back to selection pressures where that was deleterious. The part about ""degrading enough to be selected against"" still applies though.

The labs would not be told anything about the samples. Success would be if the various labs generally agree with each other (without communicating) and the timelines correspond to the old earth paradigm for the strata (for example, lava flows encased in Cambrian sediments are dated older than tertiary samples), and for the known samples, like Vesuvius, St. Helen and others, they would be close enough at +/- 5,000 years.

As a source, how about the same article Dr. Menton cites: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/278/5341/1267

&gt; Like theropod dinosaurs, most early birds, including Archaeopteryx and the enantiomithines, were likely to have retained bellowslike septate lungs.

Like when I explain to you that K-Ar is a high-resolution dating method with a half-life north of a billion years, and the very next comment you go on about four orders of magnitude as if *that* were the relevant datum.

At the resolution of the K-Ar method 300,000 is *very* close to 0. If you time a 100m race with a calendar, and the result you get is ""one day"", that result is accurate. Going on about orders of magnitude is just obfuscation.

No, this is absolutely false. It's the intercept of the complete isochron, not a mean or even just the plateau, that gives the 1925BP date.

Please note, also, that step heating is normal procedure, not some kind of fudge. Here's an example for [a much older rock](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/40-Ar-39-Ar-step-heating-age-spectrum-and-isochron-diagram-of-DN-13_fig2_250966765). The more tightly bound the argon is, the less likely it is to have been contaminated, and the higher you need to raise the temperature to liberate it. This is why you get the plateau effect, with anomalous dates at lower temperatures (= rims of the sample) that gradually level out as you get to the real, intrinsic argon.

In this case, however, this is *irrelevant anyway* because the isochron plot tells us that contamination wasn't significant (since the analyses fall on a straight line - in fact the fit was even better than they'd expected).",1579608877

As they were heating it with the laser the 40Ar left the rock? Each time they measured, there was less and less 40Ar, which lowered the date until the date gets to essentially the bottom threshold of the test's detectability (where the dating age starts to level out)?

However, the authors state: 

&gt;""based on the preserved length of the tail and available measurements of the preserved caudal vertebrae, we estimate that a complete caudal series is likely to comprise more than 25 caudal vertebrae""

&gt;the 40Ar/ 39Ar apparent age (10) calculated from the sum of all gas released is 3300 +- 500 years, clearly distinct within error from the known calendar age. With the known age, the concentration of extraneous 40Ar can be estimated...

*... from the weight of the sample (0.430 g), the total air-corrected 40Ar released (2.9 x 10^14 mol), and the K content (12.5%) of the sanidine, yielding (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^14 mol/g.*

Where do they say this?

Expected in what circumstances? There's no question of geographic dispersal, remember, because they all appear in the same regions. And over the next two thousand years they remain in a pretty stably recognisable form (and if you respond that selection swiftly eliminates the genetic variation required to allow phenotypically distinct subpopulations, then isn't the presence of highly heterozygous pairs on the ark, 1500 years after creation, the Scylla to that particular Charybdis?)",1579474549

The claim against the evolutionary view is that the mechanisms of random mutation and natural selection cannot, by themselves, explain the existence of irreducibly complex systems.  Evolutionists can agree, on one hand, that an irreducibly complex system that lacks a single part is no good for the intended purpose of the system; but on the other hand, pointing out that the system, existing as such (lacking the part which prevents it from functioning as the system we had in mind), may be able to serve some other function; and finally, that a small change could result in some such system coming to be useful for some new and higher purpose.

Strictly speaking, this is not a terrible position to take - although it does introduce new problems.  For example, if the function of the old organ could be so easily lost, why was it previously a subject of positive selection?

I said that if someone wanted to advance a scientific argument in defense of creationism that I'd be happy to take a look at it and offer feedback in the (very likely) event that I didn't find the argument convincing.  I thought this might be useful in the event that your goal in advancing a scientific argument is to persuade people of the truth of creationism who are not already persuaded.

With regards to atheists in foxholes, it doesn't matter (from a scientific point of view) who coined the phrase.  What matters is whether or not it is *true*, and then, if it is true, whether it has any bearing on the truth of creationism.  In this case neither one is true.  There are in fact atheists in foxholes, and even if there were none, that would not be evidence of a creator.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e9mdo4/evidence_for_the_creator_mitochondrial_dna/

Quote from the Gibbons study:

 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/279/5347/news-summaries

 ""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate. For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old. ... The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..""
...
""The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were “stunned” to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled..""


So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the status quo dogma.  

Mitochondrial DNA carries a genetic indicator of matrilineal descent, and can trace that descendancy all the way back, to a Most Recent Common Ancestor.. the mt-MRCA. It is ONLY passed on by FEMALES.. mother to daughter. The males get it from their mother, but it stops there. Only the DAUGHTER can pass it on.

For this reason, the mt-MRCA has been called 'mitochondrial eve,' ..not because the crafters of the phrase believe in the Genesis account of human origins, but as a cultural reference in western civilization. Most people in western civilization catch the reference to a single 'Mother of all Humanity.' 
The significance of the discovery of the mt-MRCA is often ignored and overlooked:

All of humanity, alive and dead, that has testable dna samples, can be traced to this 'mitochondrial eve'. She is the only, single human ancestor we can identify, and all of us descended from her.

Neanderthal, Pygmies, Eskimos, Norwegians, Aborigines.. any and ALL human people groups, alive or dead (with traceable dna), are descended from this mitochondrial eve.

This matrilineal descendancy is present in other organisms, and THEIR ancestral lineage can also be traced. Canids, felids, equids, etc, all have clear lines of descent, from the original mt-MRCA, in their respective haplogroup/clade/phylogenetic type.

This mitochondrial 'indicator' does NOT cross genetic boundaries, but is exclusive to the particular haplogroup/phylogenetic structure. Apes and chimps do not have the human mt-MRCA, nor do humans have any indication of sharing common ancestry with ANY other species/clade/phylogenetic type. Humans are descended from humans. Apes from apes, canids from canids, equids from equids.

The discovery of this matrilineal descendancy in the mtDNA has been a scientific boon. It has refuted many assumptions and beliefs, that are abundant in the theory of universal common ancestry, and are a problem for those who believe this theory.
I predict as more information is discovered, especially in genetics, the theory of common ancestry will join the flat earth, the 4 humours, and spontaneous generation, in the dustbin of debunked scientific theories. It has become a Religious Belief, complete with fanatical True Believers, who defend it with jihadist zeal, but they are unable to debate the science behind their beliefs.",1579443137

Is the horse a different species than a donkey?  They can mate, though the progeny is sterile.  They also share the same mt-MRCA. 

I would classify these as different clades, or haplotypes, from a common clade or haplogroup. If the genetic lineage can be traced, then the sister clades, from the same mt-MRCA indicates a common genetic heritage.  Differentiating 'species!' only from morphology, or 'looks like!' subjectivity is contrived, artificial, ambiguous,  arbitrary, and unscientific.

t1_fd6t957,JohnBerea,"Wow it's already been two weeks.  Sorry about that.

One could argue God had theological reasons for wanting all humanity to descend from a single couple... but in a way you're right about there being a slippery slope when it comes to good vs better design.  My suggestion that Adam and Eve were very heterozygous is simply assuming the best design allowed within the parameters described by the bible's description of a founding population of two.  It could even be a wrong assumption.

Above you mentioned ""I seem to remember archaeology can establish the rate independently of this, though?""  The point I'm making by quoting that paper is that most mtDNA dates don't match up with archaeological migration dates, even though the authors' dates do match up.  If we take the authors' dates and ignore the others, that's cherrypicking.

This is a topic I want to explore in more depth, but from what I've seen the mtDNA differences between organisms within most species would take about 6-10k years to accumulate, based on observed mutation rates.  In response evolutionists propose that selection removes about 95-97% of mutations that land in mtDNA, an amount that comes from counting the number of differences between human and chimp mtDNA and assuming a human-chimp common ancestor lived about 6m years ago.  Thus they calculate mtEve would've lived 200k years ago and not 6k years ago.  IIRC the mtDNA barcoding paper also used this slower rate, which made them conclude most species had their mtEve 200k years ago.

The million dollar question is:  at what rate does purifying selection filter out mutations to mtDNA?  Having 95-97% of mtDNA nucleotides subject to selection seems high even from a creationist standpoint.  But having none of them filtered by selection (as Nathaniel Jeanson's numbers imply, IIRC) seems too low.  Unfortunately I haven't read enough to even know if we we have good data on the rate of mtDNA purifying selection.

&gt; You haven't shown this. How does population genetics predict that every relevant phenotypic difference between these species should have reached fixation in a matter of decades? And where do you see historical evidence for a geographic spread? They both appear all over the Middle East.

What I mean is that if you take the assumptions of:

1.  highly heterozygous founding populations of the biblical founding population sizes of 2 to 7.
2.  Rapid geographical disperal as described in the bible.

Then applying what we know from population genetics, it's expected that new phenotypically distinct subpopulations would arise in a matter of centuries, if not decades.

&gt; You say the molecular clock differences accumulate over the past 4000 years (I'm not sure why you make that concession - couldn't that be created heterozygosity too?) so that's simply resolved by DNA-testing archaeological equid remains, isn't it?

Yes.  Biblically we'd expect to see ancient horses, donkeys, and zebras to have nearly identical mtDNA.",1579391839

&gt;clinically important antibiotic by a factor of 100,000. 

The ""-ase"" prefix after in Beta-lactamase means it is an enzyme.  The 5 simultaneous mutations will result in the reaction that beta-lactamase catalyzes will happen 100,000 times faster.

The use a cumulative selection scenario were we fix one mutation and do another round of mutation until they get the requisite 5 mutations in place.

They actually explore all possible ways of doing this with:

5-factorial = 120

If they didn't have this sequential evolution, the odds of random chance doing this would be:

1 out of 20^5 = 3,200,000

They point out:

&gt;some of the mutations do not increase cefotaxime resistance
on all allelic backgrounds. Rather, four mutations have negligible or even negative effects on drug resistance in some combinations

Using a phrase I don't like using, the 5-mutations required for the improvement makes the improvement Irreducibly Complex -- but I hate that phrase. It requires all 5 mutations to pretty much be in place simultaneously!

BUT, this paper was in the right direction and that was 14-years ago.  A lot of developments since have helped strenghthen the case, namely, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY.

The reason STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY is making a difference now is that we have better X-ray crystallography, better Cryogenic Electron Microscopy, better protein fold modelling, etc.

We can now see that the problem is like nuts fitting a bolt, or parts simply interlocking together, or passwords have the right spelling.  We can clearly see this now in the flood of 3D-diagrams showing how proteins must interlock together like parts of a Boeing 747 jetliner.  If we can attach a working wing with working ailerons to the plane, if we can attach the tail parts -- HECK if we can't attach a tires to the landing gear, the 747 won't fly!

Now with structural biology, this is visually apparent rather than these abstract counting games.  That paper was huge, and

I think this old notion of vestigiality was debunked decades ago, but is still used as an 'argument' for evolution. The perception is often slow to catch up with the facts.  

""*The 'vestigial organ' argument uses as a premise the assertion that the organ in question has no function. There is no way however, in which this negative assertion can be arrived at scientifically. That is, one can not prove that something does not exist (in this case a certain function), since of course if it does not exist one cannot observe it, and therefore one can say nothing about it scientifically. The best we can do is to state that despite diligent effort, no function was discovered for a given organ. However it may be that some future investigator will the discover the function. Consequently, the vestigial organ argument has as a premise, either a statement of ignorance (I couldn't identify the function), or a scientifically invalid claim (it does not have a function). Such an argument, from ignorance, or from negative results, is not valid scientifically, and has no place in observational or experimental science.*

I'm quoting this, not because I mind at all, but for future reference when creationists complain this kind of patronising language comes only from the evolutionist side. Creationists too often talk as if they're exclusively sinned against and, given the cycle of antagonism going on, that's part of the problem.

Anyway, to address your argument, several points.

&gt;I've been discussing evolution and creation with people for about 15 years now, and easily 95% of the time evolutionists will ultimately completely disregard any argument about how impossible evolution is or how poorly it fits with the actual evidence by defaulting back on ""but every scientist says..."".

I'll put myself in the 5% then. I agree that this would be a very poor way to shut down an argument.

However, I think as a personal heuristic for what side is most likely to be correct - *not* as an argument in a debate - it's valid to the extent that the consensus view of almost everyone who has devoted their careers to studying the evidence on a particular topic pretty much *must* be more likely to be true than false. And since one cannot personally study every relevant subfield, this is sometimes a necessary shortcut.

Now that's where your simulation hypothesis analogy completely breaks down. Firstly, it's a speculative idea commanding nothing even *approaching* consensus. Secondly, it's not really an empirical idea, and you may find that people who are rather keen on consensus in empirical, evidence-based fields are quite willing to ignore it completely when it comes to philosophical or purely logical argument.

Similarly, the factors that cause arches to collapse are incredibly relevant in determining whether a cluster of collapses is in any way significant. The article says nothing about these factors.

To take an extreme example, if someone dropped a nuclear bomb on the Arches National Park and they *all* collapsed, that would give us *no* information about the age of the arches.

Though birds and oviraptosaurs may have shared a common ancestor, there is no evidence for this. Any extrapolation backwards would have to previously assume that bird evolution is fact, which is a circular argument. Also, notice how ‘selective’ the fossil record is... preserving all of the end tips of the family tree, and *never* preserving those at the branching off points. So, there is no evidence of them sharing a common ancestor, and the temporal paradox is therefore valid.

For slide 29, I admit that your image immediately struck me as disproving my feathered dino argument. However, I then noticed a detail: the feathers were symmetrical, which could possibly identify this as not a dinosaur, but a secondarily flightless bird like Protarchaeopteryx or Caudipteryx. Could you identify what dinosaur fossil this was taken off of? Also, the image looks like it was not found preserved in rock, but in amber perhaps... does this mean that the feathers were not found in conjunction with a dino fossil?

Slide 26 needs fixing - it's just the ""If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" argument rephrased. The oviraptosaurs pictured in the figure are not the ancestors of birds. Instead, they shared a common ancestor with birds. There is nothing logically inconsistent here.

In slide 27, Protoavis is generally regarded as a chimera. Only one damaged, fragmentary specimen was found, and the interpretation of Protoavis as a bird is usually rejected.

Slide 28 is pretty problematic too. We've found dinosaurs with feathers and fluff, I don't think you can argue that they're all weighed down by scales (besides which, there are modern reptiles with thin skin as well). As well, studies show all dinosaurs (even non-feathered dinosaurs) likely had a bird-like lung, affixed to the top of the thoracic cavity. As well, many dinosaurs have been found with hollow bones (including distinctly un-birdlike dinosaurs, such as sauropods).

Slide 29 is an unusual argument. Here's feathers from a coelurosaurian (same family as T-rex). [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/ZzdoP8F). I'm not convinced that these are internal collagen. Some coelurosaurids even possessed both scales and feathers.",1579298917

&gt;Conscious experience seems to have  very large causes, though.  Dualism under weak functionalism doesn't  account for these effects.

The cause is God creating your conscious and tying it to your body. The mind controls the body and changes to the body can effect the feelings of the mind. Most good feelings are tied to biologically and socially good things and most bad feelings are tied to biologically and socially bad things. These ties are not set in stone though and can vary from different people, though probably not by much.

&gt; We also have the new problem that physical laws are no longer governing  the functions of the brain, even when energy is conserved.  This is  arguably just as bad, and not something neurologists have observed.

t1_femadzc,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; At worst I'm putting it ""on par"" with other sources of data, but even then the Bible is unique [EDIT: and primary] because it is divinely inspired, preserved, and illuminated, while other scientific instruments are fallible.

This sentence is a self-contradiction. The Bible cannot be on par AND primary.

&gt;I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. 

That's nice that you say that, but clearly in practice you don't really abide by this. Otherwise you would already have abandoned deep time and death before sin.

&gt;One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

Oh dear. It's just as bad as I thought. There is apparently not a single example of any theologian, Christian or Jewish, in the thousands of years prior to Kline that has had this revelation on how to creatively interpret Gen 3:8... how sad.

&gt;end times are completion times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed

Please see the following article:
https://creation.com/new-earth

&gt;""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

No, there was not a future promise. Adam and Eve already had access to the Tree of Life and would have kept that access if they had not sinned. Narratively, Gen 3:8 comes before God had even recognized the sin of Adam and Eve and addressed it. Therefore again it is completely out of place to start bringing in a concept that the Bible itself does not mention until all the way in Isaiah (!) that has literally nothing at all to do with this, except for Kline's highly convoluted and novel attempts to avoid an 'unpleasant' idea (to him) that God was walking in the cool of the day.

&gt;So...the Bible does give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

Without the axioms of Christianity there is no epistemology at all. If we evolved randomly we have no claim to even the ability to know things. There's no way to even get started. The Christian worldview provides the understanding of the universe which is prerequisite for doing science.

&gt;I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis. 

It's more than the least speculative, it's the direct teaching of Scripture. And here is where you deserve to be raked over the coals for sheer dishonesty, because while you make a pretense of responding point by point, you obviously skip a very crucial point and make no reference to the fact that I have shown you no less than three separate places where Scripture explicitly shows a literal historical reading of Gen 1-11 is intended. And you have ignored this. If you really want to let Scripture interpret Scripture, then you'll have no choice but to become YEC, just as every single theologian was prior to ""modern science"" telling them they had to change their views of the Bible.

t1_felnj22,Thoguth,"Well, I can't really say that it answers a question I have. I have encountered the observation that empiricism is fundamentally circular and usefulness-backed before, and read at least a few books trying to defend it, but seeing it as circular and utility-backed suffices o explain how it behaves, giving all the explanatory power that I need, and leaving no open questions except for why people who consider themselves empiricists aren't satisfied agreeing with me. From many discussions I have had and books I have indulged in searching for that answer, that part is very adequately explained by cognitive dissonance in the writer and purchaser of the book.

For you, is this something new? Did you know that that for people who approach it as skeptics, the view you consider rock solid and obvious appears circular and fundamentally incapable of arbiting truth by itself, and that without resorting to a chapter in a book you once found convincing, you don't appear to have a convincing explanation for why is not?

I looked at some meta info about that book. One of the things that I thought worth noting was that the author uses information theory and has a view that is emergent, rather than reductionist. The other is that he appears to hold the many-worlds method of resolving quantum paradoxes.

I think that in the same way one can look at ten fingers and see a thousand numbers, one can look at the Universe and see a consciousness and a will. The same philosophical mechanism (not empiricism) that enables a limited set of your neurons to hold the true idea of a consciousness called ""you"" enables the limited set of neurons in a human mind to be aware of a consciousness greater than a human mind. Such a consciousness by itself is more Deistic or Panentheistic than it would be a direct correlate with the God of Christianity, but it is about as defensible a concept as any other consciousness, and it's not a big leap to say that consciousness is what established the universe... a Creator.",1579265679

One day I left a laptop in a locked stadium.  I needed the laptop for work the next day.  There were literally locked iron gates on the doors.

I prayed - ""Hey Dad, I need that laptop.  Make the crooked places straight and cut in sunder the bars of iron.""

Into my mind popped something I always tell people:  ""Faith is belief in action.  Have faith that God will do what you ask, and then do what you do so He can make it happen.""

I started walking around the stadium, past locked iron gate after locked iron gate.  In the middle of the third time around, one of the gates opened.  A security guard I had met just before that day's game poked his head out.  I told him I left the laptop inside the park, and he let me in to retrieve it.

t1_fekzu2u,37o4,"&gt; This methodology does irreparable damage to the Bible by placing the Bible in a subservient role to what you are calling ""evidence"" from outside sources, which are in fact anti-Biblical scientific ""authorities"" and their pronouncements.

Science isn't anti-Bible, that's an incoherent claim. And I'm not putting the Bible in a subservient role. At worst I'm putting it ""on par"" with other sources of data, but even then the Bible is unique because it is divinely inspired, preserved, and illuminated, while other scientific instruments are fallible.

&gt; The propositional revelation in the Bible stands on its own merit and cannot be overruled by any human authority or consensus view.

I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. But if I'm going to do good science I have to proceed according to the methodologies and programs most beneficial to advancement in the kind of science I am doing. If the resultant data seems to be in conflict with the Bible, the way forward is (1) collect more data, (2) study the Bible more, and (3) revisit and revise the theories. I have to operate on the axiom that there can't be contradiction between good theology and good science if I'm going to get anywhere as a Christian scientist.

&gt; The plain meaning is not a ""folk"" interpretation. That's quite an arrogant thing to state. Can you name any ancient Jewish or Christian theologians who viewed Genesis 3:8 eschatologically? Or is this a brand new idea that Kline feels he is the first person in history smart enough to figure out?

One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

&gt; It's hard for me to understand how Kline failed to realize that eschatology is the study of end times, and that end times can only happen with relation to the overall scope of history which really only took its shape and form after the Fall and the Curse. End times are restoration times, and before the Curse there was nothing that needed any restoring.

You're making an enormous Biblical-theological claim here, which may be right (though even then it certainly extends beyond talk of superficial ""plain meaning""s) but which I completely disagree with: end times are **completion** times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed. As Geerhardus Vos keenly put it, ""eschatology precedes soteriology"" - a rule that has become normative in Reformed theology more broadly. And this is just an elaboration on the traditional distinction between the covenant of works (prelapsarian Adam and Christ) and the covenant of grace (postlapsarian Adam and all who are justified in Christ). For example:

1. What was the point of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (hint: what does knowing ""good and evil"" mean in the canonical context)?
2. What was the point of the tree of life (hint: how do we get to eat from it ... where else does it show up in the canon)?
3. What was the point of Jesus completing the ""first Adam""'s work if there was nothing for Adam to complete in the garden in the first place (or, if Jesus did not complete the first Adam's work, where do we stand before God)?
4. Why is the ""new heavens and the new earth"" so different from the original creation?

Now of course, you can reject the works/grace distinction or even the active obedience of Christ, but only at great risk to your entire soteriology.

Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why I have no problem with animal death before the Fall - the Garden was not the ""new heavens and the new earth,"" it was probationary, and animal death served as a sign of the threatened covenant curse (""on the day that you eat of it, you will surely die"" - how did Adam even know what death was, anyway?).

&gt; The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.

""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

&gt; No, the Bible does not give us the Scientific Method. Why should it? The Bible is propositional revelation from God. It is simply to be believed. However, God does say, ""It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out."" (Proverbs 25:2), so there is certainly a Biblical basis for doing science.
&gt;
&gt; But in the process of doing science, we can never arrive at ""truth"" that would contradict God's revealed truth, lest God be shown to be a liar.

Amen.

&gt; Science cannot be done properly except from the foundation of the Christian worldview, and that worldview cannot contradict itself.

So...the Bible *does* give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

&gt; All human claims that such-and-such evidence ""contradicts the Bible"" are based upon wrong interpretations of said evidence.

Or wrong interpretations of the Bible.

&gt; The Bible is not a science textbook, but it does make many statements with both scientific and historical implications. If you are truly an inerrantist as you claim, then you will always side with the Bible if there is a conflict between manmade ideas

Amen.

&gt; (like evolution and deep time) and the clear teachings of the Bible. You already conceded that young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture, so can you remind me why you have apparently chosen to disbelieve it anyway?

I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that **given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis**. I certainly don't believe that ""deep time"" conflicts with the ""clear teachings of the Bible,"" and I also believe that there are some innocent models of evolution (possibly excluding human common descent) which have no conflict with the text as well.

&gt; And by the way, did you read the article I linked to you about the Biblical minimum and maximum age of the earth?

A self splicing RNA exists. 

It is advantageous to improve efficiency/specificity/etc

A chaperone evolves, either through de novo means or, more likely, through another RNA binding catalyst that improves splicing efficiency. Repeat step as pressures exist. 

Splisosome function sans catalyst is deleterious either to low efficiency, specificity, etc

Nope.  They just assume it, they don't do any estimates from first principles of physics and chemistry.  It's pure faith.

In other words, Kline has committed a giant theological anachronism by suggesting an eschatological reading of a verse that came before the Curse!  The Day of the Lord to which Kline refers would not have been referenced prior to the Curse, and in fact I would argue it could not logically be referenced prior to the giving of the law, either. Why? Because, as Paul writes, ""Where there is no law there is no transgression."" (Romans 4). The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.

t1_fekguwg,Thoguth,"Well, you test it something is experimentally valid as reliable by evaluating it against other things you consider reliable. To some degree empiricism becomes circular and self-reinforcing that way, doesn't it?

Not sure why that entire kit would not potentially also be relevant to things observed to be divinely revealed. If it supports itself self-referentially and it's property useful, it seems like the process for considering it truth is identical to materialistic empiricism.

The reason it's important to understand this is that Azusfan's complaint is that he is not taken seriously in scientific debates.  If you want to be taken seriously in scientific debates then you have to adhere to the rules of science, and one of the rules of science is that evidence against one hypothesis is NOT necessarily evidence FOR a competing hypothesis.

It's hard not to read that as if part of your foundational assumptions include the idea that ""divine revelation"" cannot be considered evidence. But if it can be observed, then it could be, could it not?

Hmm... It also seems like you might have a view that seems worth probing. In that part it looks like you said the foundational assumption is that only evidence and experiment can determine truth, but then you said that foundational assumptions are de-facto truth, but are evaluated by utility, not empiricism (although the quantity of things deemed useful can be empirical, the actual utility is intrinsically something else).

You should not enter into debates like that expecting to win people over with a great argument. That’s not how it works. Jesus himself could write a scientific paper explaining exactly how he designed the universe, and it won’t matter unless God softens their hearts.

t1_feic6ok,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

Wait just a sec, let's roll back to your previous comment where you stated:  


&gt; **I would probably be willing to concede that that's what the Bible teaches** ***ceteris paribus*****.** 

Can you then not answer your own question? You have already agreed that the plain meaning of the text (when outside factors such as secular cosmology, archaeology, etc, are not considered) indicates a young cosmos. Don't try to backtrack and start mincing words. If the words of the Bible don't, at least in the most important and fundamental areas, have a ""clear and plain meaning"", then Christianity must be reduced to gnosticism, and the Bible to a Ouija board.  


&gt; What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?   


Of course I disagree! That's like saying ""if you have any margin of error whatsoever, then you know nothing.""  


&gt; I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible. 

It just so happens that the precise chronology of the Bible has been worked out to within the acceptable limits of interpretive freedom. You can read all about that here:  


 [https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth](https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""\[God\] would visit \[Adam and Eve\] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day \[that is, the Day of the Lord\]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden. 

So if any sophist comes up and gives a complicated justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the words in any place, that gives us license to disregard it? This ""exegete"" is not prepared to accept the plain meaning because, apparently, it's too incredible for her:  


**""Are we really prepared to accept the anthropomorphism of the Lord’s seeking the relief that might be afforded by the evening air from the burden of the day?""**  


I wonder if Kline is also similarly unprepared to accept the anthropomorphism of angels who eat with Abraham, or Jesus who became a man?  


We can all do without such faithless sophistry. The text states they ""heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the cool of the day."" And that's exactly what I believe happened. I don't need to understand something fully to accept it. That's what faith means, at least in part. If you are unwilling to accept something on the grounds that you don't understand it, you are placing yourself in the ranks of the scoffers. Scripture tells us of many great truths that we cannot yet understand. In some way God took a physical form and was able to walk and enjoy the cool of the day.",1579183407
t1_fejjc7d,lisper,"&gt; The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why?

No, they applied a working hypothesis that scientists would not engage in fraud because, if they did, that fraud would eventually be uncovered (which it was) and so the perpetrators would have nothing to gain.  That hypothesis turned out to be wrong, as scientific hypotheses often do.  It had nothing to do with ""childlike faith.""

&gt; This isn't a debate sub. You are not required to respond to any of it.

Yes, I know that.  I am not here to debate (though I'm happy to do so if someone wants to engage).  I'm here to learn.  But let me be clear what I am here to learn: my main interest is to understand how people maintain beliefs in things that to me seem plainly false.  I understand that better now than I did when I started this project, but I would not yet say that I have a full understanding of it.  In particular, I don't understand what you meant when you wrote:

&gt; Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table...

so I thought the quickest way to come to a better understanding was to ask for an example.  It's not because I'm ""innocent of the driven snow"", it's simply becuase I don't understand what you meant.  I can *guess*, but my guess could be wrong so I'd rather just go to the source.",1579182336
t1_feim27t,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;That doesn't imply every passage be understood as depicting literal scientific facts.

&gt;Nicodemus didn't realise this wasn't a scientifically literal rebirth, it's still theologically true.

Why is it true? Because of the **fact of the Fall.** If there was no real Fall, then there is also no real need to be born again.  


&gt; It's certainly plausible that Genesis intends to communicate literal/physical/chronological/scientific facts in its early chapters, but theological truth needn't always be based on literal let alone scientific intent of communication. 

It is not only plausible, it is the only acceptable and proper way to read the text. The whole rest of Scripture refers back to it as literal true history.",1579181809

Many evolutionists believed in Piltdown Man for 40 years, before it was revealed to be a hoax. The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why? How? Because they WANTED to believe. If you want to believe, then a little hiccup like a believing in a few falsehoods won't really matter. For a Christian example, I am sure that orthodox Southern Baptist believe in a few falsehoods, especially with regard to priorities. My Pastor is nice, but his sermons are focused on how hard it is to be a perfect Christian and then he asks for people to become Christians. That's his formula. It's pretty much the worst sales pitch I've ever heard, and it is the same every Sunday. I would rate them as damaging to the faith. One time, JD Greer visited and preached and that was a breath of fresh air. I used to be Presbyterian (many more falsehoods) before switching to Southern Baptist. The bottom line is that falsehoods are every where, but... ""let God be true, and every man a liar.""

t3_emxmx6,Thoguth,"&gt;For those of you who don't already know me, I'm an atheist who hangs out here because I think it's important to try to understand points of view with which one disagrees.

If sincere, that puts you ahead of most Internet atheists I have known.

I hope you're taking care that ""sincere, polite questions"" and ""matter-of-fact observation"" can easily creep into uninvited proselytization of your own views. If you sincerely just want to learn, my sincere encouragement would be to spend more time reading with an open mind and maybe less probing or contradicting interactions, at least outside of places constructed for those interactions.

Like this question... Why were you in an exchange with someone about True Christianity? And why do you equate that with Creationism? You can be a Muslim or Zoroastrian creationist, or even believe in some sort of creationism that involves no Deity (as the answer to Asimov's *The Last Question*)

To answer the guy's question about *True Christianity*, I would sort of say he's right, because Jesus said lots of people will not make it. Even if 100% of the world were nominally Christian, they would not be ""true Christians"" in the sense of Jesus' ""narrow way"", that's correct, it would invalidate His words, but I personally think it's incredibly unlikely because actually following Jesus for real is *really dang hard*. It's way easier to be a casual, part-time Christian or a hypocritical self-righteous one than to be a sincere follower of Jesus teachings and example.

What does that have to do with Creationism though?",1579145915
t1_feh9l6i,Thoguth,"&gt;First, there is no ""narrowly-defined subset of evidence"" that is the ultimate arbiter of scientific truth. To be accepted, a scientific theory has to be consistent with all of the evidence no matter its source.

When most strident atheists use the term ""evidence"", they don't mean all the things that can be convincing, they mean something special and more specific. If you are skeptical of this, try talking to them about things widely recognized by religious believers as evidence for what they believe in. In practice, it's a subset, which does not include conflicting measurement, personal testimony, documented events, or even input from their own senses if that input contradicts what their pre-existing view. Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table for the type of almost you most often find trying to prove something on the Internet. They tend to prove their own insecurities and emotionality, dramatically (and somewhat tragically) in contrast to the detached scienctific neutrality of which they are a cargo cult.

&gt;Second, foundational assumptions are always true by definition. The only way to judge a foundational assumption is by its utility.

Wow, this is a breath of fresh air. I have spent an inordinate amount of back and forth with someone recently who seems so close to understanding this but just doesn't get it.

&gt;That is essentially what has brought us modern technological civilization. 

This is reductive, though. Empirical iteration has improved our understanding of many things that have enabled us to be more effective, but without more basic civilization-sustaining practices like morality, motivation, and social connection, we would have no civilization to be technological. The recent fad of attempting to discard or reverse foundational assumptions that created languages, nations and cultures because they're (falsely) seen as contradictory to ones that created SD cards, is tremendously short-sighted and fundamentally illogical.",1579144224

Heretic!  ;-)

&gt; Mark 9:24

I'm already familiar with that passage.  I don't see how it's relevant.  If God exists then He knows I seek the truth, and He also knows what kind of evidence I need in order to accept something as the truth (unless, of course, he is as willfully ignorant of the present as He is about the future).  He could easily provide that evidence if He chose to (assuming of course that He's omnipotent) but He hasn't.  So at least some of the story I've been told about God must be false.  Since I have no reason to give any more credence to one part of it over the other, I reject it all (contingent to getting new information of course).

What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?

Note that you may disagree about the truth of the antecedent without disagreeing about the truth of the entire proposition.

&gt; Evidences don't interpret themselves.

That is true, but they are not necessarily interpreted by the Bible. The Bible may *present* to us historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological hypotheses, but does it tell us *how to do* historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological science?

To engage with a particular quote from the article you linked:

&gt; For example, if this were correct, then only those with knowledge of modern science could rightly interpret the Bible. Also, since scientific ideas are constantly changing, then the Bible’s message would be constantly changing, from century to century.

This seems to me to be an enormous overstatement. I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible.

&gt; [...] you are allowing the clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible to be overruled [...]

Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""[God] would visit [Adam and Eve] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day [that is, the Day of the Lord]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden.

My only point is that ""clear and plain meaning"" is in my opinion an incoherent concept, especially when applied comprehensively to ""the Bible"" in its entirety (the Westminster Confession of Faith, for example, says that ""all things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all,"" and I would concur). I think that letting the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 1-11 do this much heavy lifting for you is a recipe for disaster.",1579135083

God's omniscience must be in coherent understanding with all Scripture, and by God's own admission, in His own words, He says that he did not foresee that His people would engage in the child-sacrifice practices of the surrounding cultures. He also was grieved at how evil Adam's offspring turned out to be before the Flood. This seems to suggest that while God has the power to see the future, He does not look at it constantly and some future events surprise and disappoint him, which makes the inverse true: some future events surprise and delight Him (like your repentance, hehe).

You confuse beliefs about what gave rise to the natural world (a religious belief) with the scientific knowledge we have about the way things are.  To the extent that evolutionists practice science (and they do), they are generating data that, first and foremost, tells us about the way things are in the present; and thereby we can say various things about the way things will be in the future.  And that is always very valuable.

To the extent that those beliefs about the past (which cannot be tested or repeated) yield testable and successful predictions about the way the world will be found to be, alternative views about the past, properly understood, yield the same predictions.  I am aware of several predictions that UCD believers would not have made, or made incorrectly, whereas YEC yielded true predictions: for example, UCD believers held to spontaneous generation until they were corrected by a YEC.  UCD believers would not have predicted that we would be finding soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, and yet, here we are.  UCD believers taught doctors to yank out healthy appendixes during cesareans because they were ""vestigial"".  UCD believers predicted that ethnic differences amounted to a division of races into higher and lower.  

At any rate, that's not even the same kind of ""predictive success"" that I was attributing to the scientific method.  The scientific method allows us to know how things will behave in specific circumstances; thus by contriving those circumstances, we can predict how those things will behave.  Belief in an old earth and universal common descent don't allow us to do that in anything approaching the same way.  The failures of UCD beliefs are far more harmful than the kinds of failures to which the scientific method are prone.

At any rate, I am interested to know what kind of predictions one would make on the basis of attributing the state of the natural world to blind, accidental forces combined with natural selection; which would not be made, or would be made wrongly on the basis of attributing the state of the natural world to the special, intelligent creation by a common designer?",1579101329

The only way around this is to say that God did not directly control anything, but he just superintended the process from afar (which would be deism, not theism).",1578951831

Maybe I am misunderstanding and maybe you would claim that life is different than non-life, but essentially you are claiming, if this is correct, that God knows everything that will happen?

2. Or, as some have concluded/accused, the Creator is pleased by death, suffering, and corruption, and takes sadistic pleasure in them.

&gt;4. Or, there could be other forces, or factors, that have temporarily (or permanently) confounded the original purposes of the Creator.

This can't be true, for as i said, anything that immutes, confounds, divides or otherwise degrades the infinity of God cannot be. There cannot be polytheism, as it cuts the nature of God into many. The trinity sidesteps this as it is the character of God and not the being and nature of God which is split.

I suppose i should've included this, but The real reason there is death, flawed humanity, and a dying world, comes logically from the nature of God. If God is infinite Good, essentially perfect, then would not whatever he makes be perfect? And yet it is not. So how do you get imperfection from perfection? Freedom of choice. Just as it is not fate or free will which will save us, it was not quite either which doomed us. Rather, it was an aligning of will with that of the devil.

Positing an end to time or space is a leap of faith, wifh only abstract conceptualization and imagination as the driver.  Empirically, an end (or beginning) of time and space is illogical.  Only if you depart materialism, and enter the realm of metaphysical possibility can matters of infinity and eternity be bipassed as a logical problem.  But then, we are no longer viewing the universe as an empirical observer, but a cosmic philosopher. 

This thread, in a scientific based subreddit, is about empirical evidence for The Creator,  and what we can conclude about this Creator from the evidence.  Matters of belief, and transcendence from reason and empiricism do not really help us.

As physical, material beings, in a physical,  material universe, both infinity and eternity are inescapable concepts. No matter how far we go, in any direction, physical space continues.  Infinite space is very troubling, and upsets our finite minds, so we concoct imaginary explanations,  that help us depart from the uncomfortable conclusion of limitless time and space.

The Creator has no limits..  no beginning..  no place He does not occupy.  He inhabits eternity, and dwells in infinity. We can no more grasp that than any concept of infinite, or eternal, time and space. 

So, as attributes of The Creator, infinite and eternal are logical conclusions,  for us trapped in the space/time continuum. 

Beliefs, and mystical conjectures about infinity and eternity have obsessed man for millennia..  not infinity.  ;)  we are finite beings,  in an infinite universe, created by an infinite God, and are troubled by that concept, it seems, and try to reconcile the conflicts we have by mental gymnastics.   But regardless of how clever or entertaining,  or plausible these imaginations might be, we are still here..  in an infinite, eternal moment of time and space..  alone in the dark.. groping for substance, lost in the infinite recesses of the universe. 

Are we having fun, yet?  :D

t1_fdqetwl,NanoRancor,"One response i will leave here, is that time, space, and matter are a conceptual trinity of the universe hearkening to the creator, but nothing but the creator will ever be infinite, as he exists on a plane higher than his own creation. Now take this thought experiment: If time is infinite then how will it take until tomorrow? Logically it would be infinite time. Therefore with infinite time we can never have even gotten to today. There must've been a beginning. Now try and do the same thing with space by asking how long would it take to walk down the street and maybe you can start to see the problem. By making space infinite you are fundamentally destroying the concept of distance. By making time infinite you destroy the logic of a second. And by making matter infinite you destroy the reality of size. Also if space is infinite, then wouldn't an infinite number of stars blind the world?

The dilemma of an end to space will seem to become an impass to logical thought, but there are a few possible ideas that seem to work: An infinite nothingness, or void, which would remain infinite no matter how much space is within it; Water, as it could be the water stretched from water at the creation was placed at the edge of the universe; Heaven, as perhaps creation was built on top of the spiritual realm in a sense and so once going to the end you would find the infinite spirit of God and his home.

t3_emxmx6,gmtime,"I'd rather use Jesus' words when approaching this question, though PDP uses valid exegesis as well I think. Jesus tells us narrow is the gate and few will find it (Matthew 7:13-14). If for some reason many will find it, then Jesus would not be telling the truth. How could true Christianity not invalidate itself, if Jesus Himself would speak untruths?

Yet we are called to bring the Gospel to all nations, and so we do. In practice, many reject the Gospel, which leads to Christianity not becoming the major worldview.

I believe the Bible to be a reliable recording of the history of the earth, and that includes the time Jesus walked the earth. If I however would reject part of it, then which part and why? Wouldn't I be putting my own insight above God's Book? Jesus Himself relies on the historicity of the Genesis account when explaining why a husband and wife should not divorce. (Matthew 19:3-6, quoting Genesis 1:27, 2:24) so that means that I should too. This is why I adhere to the young earth model.

Before I became a Christian, I assumed the evolutionist old universe narrative, because it sounded well thought out, I never *really* checked it through. Now that I know the Lord, I rejected the old universe on the basis of scripture, not on the basis of observations. The observations are in my opinion the **result** of discovering that the Bible had a conflicting narrative with old age, and so far it seems there are quite a few gaping holes in the old earth narrative that allows for young earth as a viable alternative interpretation of the same observations.

I am not undermining my belief by proclaiming the Gospel or promoting young earth, because the Bible teaches us that we should, but not many will listen. Only if many would listen (in the sense of obeying) would it disprove true Christianity, but it doesn't.",1578697981

t3_emxmx6,mswilso,"I don't know about ""invalidating"" itself. Personally, (and I don't speak for all creationists or even YECs) I believe two things primarily: 

1) When we arrive at the endgame of history (Great White Throne judgement, or whatever you imagine it to be), we will discover that *historically* (not just ""religiously"") that ""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth...."" I think it's pretty plainly explained in both Hebrew and English. Lots of people will say the language is open to interpretation, but there comes a point where we have to assume that God means what He says, or else language uses all facility and ultimately its meaning. 

2) As I have stated in previous comments, evidence is just that -- evidence. There are facts readily available for all, but we all interpret data through the filter of our personal world view. I've seen it in person too many times: You can look at a picture of a geological formation (canyon or whatever) and see one concept (millions of years of erosion) and I can look at the same picture and see evidence of a universal flood. Same picture. Same evidence. Two different world views. 

It's like a jury in a court case with two lawyers, both presenting the same (presumably) sets of evidence, but coming to two radically different conclusions. 

From this point in history, we will argue both, but because neither of us were THERE, all we can do is argue about it. I believe that God was there, and He gave us, through His revealed word, the authorized version of the story as it happened. You may choose not to believe it, and that's fine. In the end, though, when we look back on it all, we will be able to say with no quibbling, that God spoke the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; about how He created life, the universe and everything (with apologies to Douglas Adams).",1578694945

Concluding that humans did not descend from any animal would prove that evolutionism is false, which is unacceptable to them, and that's why they are even willing (though not always consciously or deliberately) to deceive the public by making up loads of things construed as evidence.",1578647625

The 'scientific method' is just a means of observation and reasoning, utilising principles of consistency and logic. Ultimately however, science so-called cannot give us absolute knowledge - in the same way you know that murder is absolutely wrong through your con-science, your 'with knowledge'. 

If all you had is scientific method and reasoning, you have no way to prove it's validity, other than using your own reasoning - proven by your own reasoning.. Theory built upon theory..

In a similar way to that which we can know absolute moral values, God himself can reveal truth to our hearts and minds, mainly through his word - you can KNOW. But again, this is by way of revelation, not purely reason. You could say that logic and reason proceed from knowledge, but you can't use logic and reason to reach knowledge.

Think about logic for a moment.. You're using *knowledge* of absolute, objective and universal logic to make scientific inference at all in the first place.

My point is that, if the Bible is the word of God, which I believe it to be, then it's an even more valid source of truth than what's commonly referred to as the scientific method.

t1_fdoierr,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; And you're adding to the text by saying God would have told Adam about it in a conversation that is not present in the text anywhere. That, my friend is ""reading into the text.""

I added nothing to the text. I am merely stating that we don't know what conversations Adam and God had, which means you cannot assume that the only way Adam knew what death was was to observe it. The scriptures nowhere state that ""the wages of sin is death"" is somehow only for humans. All death is a wage of sin.

&gt;If you're willing to accept your additions to the story, you can't then reject someone else's just because you disagree with them. 

I reject your speculation because it is contrary to scripture which states ""the wages of sin is death"" and ""by one man sin entered the world and death through sin."" And it is contrary to the nature of God, who would not needlessly torture animals by causing them to kill and die when no sin or rebellion had been committed.

&gt;God did not curse the world, since as an omniscient being, He would have already known how to prepare the world for man to struggle in.

Wrong again. God said, ""cursed is the ground for your sake"". Paul wrote, ""the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.""

The issue is not God's omniscience, but God's goodness and justice. God did not curse the world, including animals, until Adam sinned and brought about that curse.

&gt;We can't know because it's not in the text anywhere.

Exactly. But your interpretation only works by assuming that God did **not** explain to Adam what death was prior to the Fall. You cannot make any such assumption.

&gt;What is in the text is that sin entered into the world through man and death also came to man through man's actions, there is nothing in the text that says that death also entered into the rest of nature when man sinned or that no animals died prior to man's sin.

Wrong, you are twisting Scripture. The Bible says ""sin entered the world and death through sin."" Romans 5:12. You want to bring in death without sin, or artificially restrict the meaning where the Scripture makes it universal.

&gt;You have pointed out that the account is not exhaustive, so the fact that there is no mention of animals dying cannot be taken as evidence that they were not.

If you're willing to accept your additions to the story, you can't then reject someone else's just because you disagree with them.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

As an example, we are told, in the text, that God made a special garden for man to live in.  The fact that God had to create a special place where man could live would seem to indicate that prior to the creation of the garden, the world was not a man-friendly place; it was wild and dangerous, a place where nature included death and killing, and that it's nature did not change after man sinned, which is why God kicked man out of the garden.  If man had remained in the garden, he would have had no trouble working the land since it was specifically prepared for him by God, all that happened was that God placed man in the wild world outside the garden; God did not curse the world, since as an omniscient being, He would have already known how to prepare the world for man to struggle in.

t1_fdmlely,brokensheep,"&gt;If abiogenesis does appear in literature, it's as a hypothesis, and not a (proven) theory.

Not as far as I understand, no. I believe that in most high school science textbooks, through which the majority of the western populace receive their education, you will find diagrams showing the formation of the first living cell, evolving through unexplained means into (irreducibly complex) creatures such as trilobites and brachiopods. They make note of the Miller-Urey and how this demonstrates abiogenesis as historically factual. I'm yet to see a textbook with a bold disclaimer in effect stating that popular science has no factual basis for claiming the first sea worms and jellyfish came about through natural means from dead matter. And this is also disregarding the fact that there's about 1.5 billion years of 'missing' fossil evidence between the first supposed living cell and the first animals. The fossil record would indicate these complex creatures appeared spontaneously.

Wikipedia: **Abiogenesis**, or informally the **origin of life** is the [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural) process by which [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound). ...  Although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly understood. 

Would denying the possibility of the existence of God be unscientific?.. You already agree. Yet for many, this is a forgone conclusion to which all further interpretation of evidence must conform. You don't have to falsify ID, you just have to demonstrate as factual, the possibility of the complexity of life as we observe, spontaneously arising from non-living matter. So far this has proven futile.. As I would also assert has been attempts to demonstrate otherwise unobservable 'macro-evolution' - allegedly having happened over millions of years. We can breed many generations of fruit flies or bacteria, while exposed to variation of environmental stimuli, yet they remain fruit flies or bacteria. This is clear demonstration of insufficient data needed to conclude hypothesised large-scale changes within a population due to random mutation and natural selection, or so-called generational neutral drift - such as fish growing legs and becoming land-dwelling mammals.

Do you understand the concept of molecular chirality? Intelligent selection is the only conceivable explanation. But again, we're discussing abiogenesis. Did you watch the entire Dr James Tour interview?

Concerning miraculous creation being unfalsifiable utilizing scientific method, I agree. Partly because I believe it did happen, being definitively unfalsifiable.. but what you're really asking pertains to definition of truth. 

You're setting scientific method as the 'gold standard' for determining truth, in this case history and the origin of life. But your problem is that logic (albeit using universal objective standard) and reasoning cannot give you truth.. All you have is theorising built upon theorising validated by your own reason, in turn validated by your own reasoning.. But how do you know your own reasoning is valid?

Totally! And to my knowledge which is fairly current, we don't (at least in the US). If abiogenesis does appear in literature, it's as a hypothesis, and not a theory.    

&gt;And that to deny the possibility of intelligent design, the most obvious explanation for issues like chirality, unscientific?

There's a lot to unpack in this sentence. I agree that denying *any* possibility without making an honest inquiry is unscientific. The problem I see with ID from a scientific standpoint is that it is an unfalsifiable claim. Therefore it is immune from legitimate scientific inquiry. So while it may be unscientific to deny the possibility, I don't think anyone does that, it just can't be investigated honestly using the scientific method. And I think the so far lackluster scientific evidence is to be expected given that fact, even if it is true. So until that issue is resolved it's sort of, merely interesting. (I have a little more on this at the end)

What issue with chirality? And what explanatory power does ID have for it? 

&gt;Now that's seemingly a strange opinion, I don't read that in the textbooks..

It is? I mean...do you disagree? It would be odd if the cause for life, whatever it is, didn't exist. I think that idea is implied so heavily by our existence it's not necessary to print XD lol.    

&gt;""We don't know."" Where's that in the public education curriculum?

Do you honestly think it's not? Biology textbooks do not make claims on the origin of life. Fact. I think you'd be hard pressed to prove me wrong on that one. If they discuss abiogenesis *at all* in them, it's as a hypothesis. Those same books teach kids what a hypothesis is, too. An unproven, untested, non-peer reviewed idea. That's what ""We don't know, but here's some prevailing ideas"" *is.*

If your objection is that while an unproven idea like that one is shared, but not ideas like ID, it's pretty much for the reason I listed earlier. Believe me I've looked, and it is nigh impossible to find a falsifiable version of ID that is agreed upon by the ID community at large. If you could help me out here, I'd be very grateful. That's the first step towards getting the idea investigated honestly, and listed side by side with those other ideas in the textbooks. Something those other ideas have already established.

&gt; No, otherwise death could not have been a punishment

Interesting. Given our fallen state, physical death could be seen as a mercy. Otherwise we would live forever in our sinful state, forever separated from the holiness of God. 

&gt;God said that if you eat of the tree, you will surely die.

Yes, and this is the phrase which the serpent exploits. When Adam and Eve eat of the tree, things immediately change for them spiritually; they rebelled against God's command, they have turned their leadership/helper roles around, they experience guilt and shame, they blame each other, they hide from God, and even blame God for the situation. They have indeed experienced a spiritual death, a separation from the holiness of God. Pain, suffering, and physical death would come later.

I'm not saying that God intended man to (physically)die at creation, rather that without the tree of life man would (physically)die. God provided the tree of life to man with the intention that they partake of God's goodwill. Likewise the tree of *knowledge* was provided that man might show respect and obedience to God. Because of our sin however, the tree of life was mercifully withheld from us that we would not have to live forever in that fallen state. In that sense, our physical death is a result of the fall.

&gt;but after the Fall no amount of food, save that one particular food, would have made us live forever.

I just wanted to comment on your phrasing here. Not sure if you intended it, but this immediately made me think of John 6:35;  
*“I am the Bread of Life,” Jesus told them. “The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty.*",1578521802
t1_fdlbs99,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; even though such death would have not caused suffering, because suffering did not exist.

Why would you say that? You listed an animal being crushed by another animal. How do you propose there would have been no suffering involved with that?

&gt;the meaning of being ""very good"" is used through a human lens, for instance.

No, Scripture tells us much about the nature of God, and what is good and evil. Scripture does regard animal suffering and animal cruelty as evils.

&gt;I'm not saying that your belief is wrong, but I am saying the significance to which you are attributing that it is either biblically settled or reasonably settled are exaggerated.

The fact that God is merciful and not arbitrarily cruel to his creations is not trivial. The fact that the Bible's record of history, going back around 6000 years to creation, can be trusted--is also not trivial.

&gt;But I would like you to see that there is a high degree of wiggle room used in your argument, and stating it as settled is at least not 100% genuine when presenting it to others.

You are the one inserting wiggle room where there is none, for the purpose of trying to cram anti-biblical philosophy into the Bible. Darwin called evolution ""the Devil's gospel"", and he was quite right.",1578520927
t1_fdl8d4t,buttermybreadwbutter,"&gt; But you forget that God walked with Adam in the Garden prior to the Fall. God's direct sustaining presence here would have prevented such things as accidental deaths. God called his original creation ""very good"", and the nature of God as omnibenevolent means that God would not call those evil things you listed ""very good"", or allow them to happen for no reason.

This is speculative. First of all, none of those things I listed were evil. This is inconsistent arguing. The things I described are both creative and destructive events because of the nature of matter. For instance, it rained and the rain would collect, to feed the plants. You are saying God prevented there being too much or too little rain. To avoid over watering or collecting in pools to avoid drowning small animals. You are saying every interaction within the entire universe was governed by God the Creator to prevent anything that would have resulted in an accidental death, even though such death would have not caused suffering, because suffering did not exist.
This is simply put, an inconsistent position that selectively uses scripture mixed with hypotheticals about God when there is no scripture, while claiming to be plainly biblical. The meaning of being ""very good"" is used through a human lens, for instance. When all that it truly means is that it means it was as God intended it. Because how could the day man was created have been lacking anything if indeed it was very good? When God saw Adam was lacking companionship, it immediately followed God stating he was pleased with his creation. This is an example I use to prove that the way some people use the terms ""very good"" to extrapolate out, and assume that events resulting in death would be ""evil"" even though they acknowledged God was creating is illustrating that we are not basing this on pure biblical reading. We are basing it on our own, in this case, your own opinions of what God created, as to what He saw as good.
I'm not saying that your belief is wrong, but I am saying the significance to which you are attributing that it is either biblically settled or reasonably settled are exaggerated.

Drowning. Falling. Stepped on by larger animals. Weather. Fire. Exposure. Eaten by accident when they were on the leaves the other animals were eating. Suffocation. Choking. Landslides. Earthquakes. Tornadoes. Toxic reactions or allergies? I could keep going...

This whole, herbivore and deathless pre-fall world doesn't work at all.

Think about it, if no animals ever were to die, ever, how long until the face of the land was covered in animals so close that they could not move? How long until they ate all the plants? Just grow more plants? Would the seas fill full of fish? What about animals that reproduce rapidly? This means that God created a planet, ecosystem and life with a limited duration of viability. Death, without sin, without the fall, is a perfect way to incorporate life into renewal. Decay gives birth to new. Energy is returned to the soil from which it grows plants, and feeds animals. Death being a part of life is the only thing that makes sense. All of the pre-fall death arguments I have ever heard are very careful dances around verses taken to try to prove the point. Rather than a comprehensive clear message found in the text.

Your citation that creation suffered the pains of childbirth is good. It means we had things before the fall that were also after the fall that are painful now, but were they then?

True, but animals were under the headship of Adam and were cursed along with the rest of creation because of Adam's sin. God said, ""Cursed is the ground for your sake.""

No. Nothing without a soul could have consciousness or emotions, and animals have these. They have animal souls. This is also confirmed in the book of Ecclesiastes:

&gt;That's just quibbling over phraseology. My assumption is that evidence rather than a holy text is the ultimate arbiter of what is true.

I literally just refuted this kind of wrong thinking in my previous post. You didn't so much as refer to any part of what I said, and here you are just restating your highly incorrect conception of how evidence works. I'd say don't bother responding at all if that is what you plan to do.

&gt;No. In fact, there are lots of different ""laws of logic"". Some of them are useful in some situations, others are useful in others, and still others are not useful at all.

The laws of logic are a prerequisite for all truth  and knowledge and communication. So you are denying that you can communicate or know anything or that anything could be objectively true. For example, all these things depend upon the immutability of the law of non-contradiction.

&gt;Absolutely not. I do believe this is true, but that's because the evidence indicates that it is true. It's a remarkable fact. It need not have been this way.

No! You cannot even evaluate evidence without already *presupposing* this. Just saying ""the evidence indicates it is true"" is begging the question completely! What do you mean by ""the evidence indicates"" if not ""I have observed it happening this way in the past""? But that would be irrelevant information unless you were taking as an assumption the uniformity of nature. It's circular.

&gt;Absolutely not. In fact we know (because there's evidence) that the human brain is easily fooled.

Stating this means you are refuting your own claim to any knowledge of any kind, since you are dependent upon the human brain for your own thoughts. We already established that.

&gt;Absolutely not. Morality is partly a result of evolution, and partly something humans invent.

Absolutely not. Neither of those things are real morality at all. Both are just practical measures for survival or comfort. True morality depends 1) upon human free will, which requires a soul and 2) upon objective moral truths independent of any human thoughts. Your worldview cannot provide either of those prerequisites.

&gt;Again, I believe this to be true, but not as an assumption. There's tons of evidence for it, and the mechanisms by which this process happens are quite well understood (with the notable exception of abiogenesis -- the jury is still out on that).

Simply stating something does not make it true. There is nothing remotely accurate about your statement. There is zero evidence that random chance produces spontaneous functional integrated complexity. And the fact that abiogenesis is impossible is a function of that exact aspect of reality. If random chance could produce functional complexity, then abiogenesis would be quite demonstrable in a lab setting. Randomness produces chaos. That's why engineers don't randomly throw stuff together to design bridges, technology, houses, skyscrapers...

t1_fdjucmj,lisper,"&gt; This statement you're making right here is not subjective.

Actually it is, I'm just using shorthand so I don't get too wordy.  What I really mean by ""subjective perceptions are all anyone can talk about"" is something like, ""I (the thing writing this sentence) have the subjective perception of existing ""inside of"" or ""tightly bound to"" a material object that I call my body.  I also have the subjective perception of the existence of other bodies that are very similar (but not quite identical) to my own.  I have the subjective perception that I can cause my body to make sounds and motions that correspond to subjective perceptions that I call my ""needs and desires"" (e.g. when I feel hungry I can cause my body to walk to the refrigerator and get a snack), and I have the subjective perceptions that the other bodies that I perceive behave in similar ways.  The most parsimonious explanation I can think of to explain all this is that the other bodies that I perceive are also inhabited by things with subjective perceptions that are similar (but not quite identical) to my own.  And because *I* am limited in what I can know to *my* subjective perceptions, I *infer* that the other entities that inhabit the other bodies are similarly limited.""

I also *infer* the existence of an objective reality because I have the subjective perception that a large subset of these other bodies behave in ways that are consistent with that theory.  So, for example, I can say to my wife, ""Honey, would you please go to the refrigerator and bring me a snack?""  and the result will be (usually) that I will have the subjective perception that my wife will go to what I perceive to be the refrigerator and bring me something that I perceive to be a snack.  Again, the most parsimonious explanation is that my wife's subjective perceptions include refrigerators and snacks, and the most parsimonious explanation of *that* is that refrigerators and snacks actually exist.

BTW, this theory actually turns out to be *wrong*.  Refrigerators and snacks almost certainly do *not* exist in point of metaphysical fact.  But to understand that you have to understand quantum mechanics.  But treating the world *as if* refrigerators and snacks actually exist is a good enough approximation to the truth that it works for all everyday situations.  So I call that ""the truth"" not because I believe it's actually metaphysically true, but just because considering it to be true is *useful* and helps me navigate the world more effectively.

&gt; you are not taking as your assumption ""the reliability of evidence"".

That's just quibbling over phraseology.  My assumption is that evidence rather than a holy text is the ultimate arbiter of what is true.  (This does not rule out the possibility that the evidence could show that a holy text is a reliable guide to truth.  I just don't accept the truth of any holy text as an *assumption*.  You do.)  For me, the Bible is judged by the evidence, and for you, the evidence is judged by the Bible.

&gt; here would be my guess as to your assumptions

You are wrong on all counts:

&gt; The laws of logic are universal and immutable.

No.  In fact, there are lots of different ""laws of logic"".  Some of them are useful in some situations, others are useful in others, and still others are not useful at all.

&gt; The uniformity of nature is universal and immutable (the future in its fundamental operation will be like the present).

Absolutely not.  I do believe this is true, but that's because the evidence indicates that it is true.  It's a remarkable fact.  It need not have been this way.

&gt; The human brain and human sense perception are both able to provide accurate truth knowledge.

Absolutely not.  In fact we know (because there's evidence) that the human brain is easily fooled.

&gt; There is real objective morality-good and evil.

Absolutely not.  Morality is partly a result of evolution, and partly something humans invent.  Morality is a kind of ""technology"" that helps humans work together to achieve common goals.  (I have to stress here in particular that this is HIGHLY oversimplified!)

&gt; Blind unguided nature is able to spontaneously produce complexity and the illusory appearance of design.

Again, I believe this to be true, but not as an assumption.  There's tons of evidence for it, and the mechanisms by which this process happens are quite well understood (with the notable exception of abiogenesis -- the jury is still out on that).

&gt;  I have one starting assumption: God's Word is Truth.

No, you have at least one additional starting assumption: God's Word is accurately reflected by the content of particular holy text among many: the Bible.

&gt; my worldview is much more elegant

No, it isn't.  It just packs all of its inelegance into the phrase ""God's Word.""

You most certainly can and I appreciate it, thanks for the response! You even defined a term, my word I'm in heaven :). It works with that presumption too, but the *first* part of the definition. Hence why it's irrelevant, it doesn't really matter what one takes to be the origin story of life, it's compatible.  

I would add that supernatural things by definition, don't exist. There is nothing beyond the laws of nature, whatever is real, even if once *thought* to be supernatural, once proved real, become natural. I think we can agree that whatever first created life, whether an entity, natural process or something else, definitely exists.

If we stick with the ""beyond scientific understanding"" part of the definition, then we agree 100%. We really don't have a good enough reason to think abiogenesis is true. On paper it sounds nice, but honestly the answer right now is, ""We don't know."" The origin of life is conclusively beyond scientific understanding, for now.

This statement you're making right here is **not** subjective. You are making an absolute claim about objective reality. Yet you cannot.

&gt;That's why you have to take the truth of the Bible as an assumption, and I have to take the reliability of evidence as an assumption

As I have repeatedly explained, you are not taking as your assumption ""the reliability of evidence"". Evidence is neither reliable nor unreliable. It simply is. It must be interpreted from within a worldview, and it is the reliability or truthfulness of that worldview that will determine whether or not the conclusions drawn from the evidence are accurate. We both have access to the [same evidence](https://creation.com/its-not-science)!

We both live in the same world with the same bones, the same fossils, the same stars, the same oceans, the same geological features, the same historical documents, the same bible, etc. But we are interpreting all those facts (the evidence) vastly differently.

I cannot speak for you, but here would be my guess as to your assumptions, each of which you must take as brute facts that cannot themselves be proved:

**The laws of logic are universal and immutable.**

**The uniformity of nature is universal and immutable (the future in its fundamental operation will be like the present).**

**The human brain and human sense perception are both able to provide accurate truth knowledge.**

**There is real objective morality-good and evil.**

**Blind unguided nature is able to spontaneously produce complexity and the illusory appearance of design.**

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I have one starting assumption:

**God's Word is Truth.**

And from this one flows all of your assumptions, save the last one. In this way, my worldview is much more elegant and avoids arbitrariness. It fits with Ockham's Razor. And when I apply this one starting assumption, I can make sense of the world, including the evidence which you cannot process from within your worldview, e.g. the resurrection of Christ from the dead, the fulfilling of ancient prophecies by Christ, the obvious design in nature coupled with the fact that we don't observe spontaneous functional complexity happening.",1578487776

The answer to the first question is that different species have different survival strategies.  Impala survive by being fast, but zebras survive not only by being fast (they are actually almost as fast as an impala -- 40mph top speed vs 50) but also by being big.  Even if a lion catches a zebra, victory is by no means assured.  The combination of speed and size is what keeps zebras from being hunted to extinction by lions.

The answer to the second question is that the vast majority of mutations are harmful.  The rare beneficial ones persist *only if they are passed on to the next generation*.  So for sexually reproducing organisms, random mutation is potentially beneficial *only* in gamete cells.  In all other cells, random mutations are almost certain to be harmful to the individual in which they occur.  So there's a net benefit to each individual to have repair mechanisms, and so a net benefit to the genes to have those mechanisms.  But you're right: if the repair mechanisms worked perfectly, and if they worked on gamete cells, evolution would stop.",1578461145

FIRST. AMEN that feathers existed at the time of ""dinos"".

Second,  YES flightless birds are mistaken for dinos. AMEN. they think so too.

third. YES misidentifying things is alive and well in these matters.

This does not deny that these dinos were irds for creationists. instead ts a hint, eureka moent in the bath, that the differences between flightless birds and theropod dinos is so little EVEN EVOLUTIONIST admit they get them mixed up. this because I INSIST theropod dinos ARE ONLY BIRDS!! Thats the equation. E=Mc2.

Creationists should not be intrenching in some dino division or dinos are not bird like or stirred up about feathers but instead become dinosaur killers. kill the concept and people asking us WHAT ABOUT DINOS AND GENESIS.

instead squeeze them into bird kinds. NOT intermediates and not the origin of birds but JUST DUMB BIRDS.

It doesn't matter about size, teeth, tails, T rex had a wishbone because only birds have them. not bcause birds evolved from t rex as modern evolutionists have been FORCED to say.

Creationists are wrong to deny feathers existed on theropod dinos and not desire to find them. I DO desire to find T rex with a glorios plumage like the modrn cassoway or ostrich.

By the way if its admitted by creationists that flightless birds are misclassified as dinos then creationists must admit some theropod looked like birds. YEC must follow its own logic if making this article case in point.

Viruses are RNA based instead of DNA based, so they lack one of the most essential error checking mechanisms.

Zero mutations is not a beneficial trait, so any organism that develops such a trait would be vulnerable to minor changes in their ecosystem. Instead, most lethal mutations get detected and cause a cell to destruct itself for the benefit of the organism, or the organism's immune system destructs the cell.

Maybe it actually takes away energy and causes a net energy loss. In this case it would create less problems. In theory it is possible for the consciousness to change the brain and not create any problems though. It might have to balance out moving electricity by depleting the power of an impulse somewhere else in the brain.

Conscious experience seems to have very large causes, though.  Dualism under weak functionalism doesn't account for these effects.  

We also have the new problem that physical laws are no longer governing the functions of the brain, even when energy is conserved.  This is arguably just as bad, and not something neurologists have observed.  

&gt;I demand an explanation on how conscious thoughts supervene on particle interactions. I think that elements of primary experience are crisp and easy to understand. The color red is red, feeling sad is sad, etcetera. They are hard to define in language because of an explanatory gap. However, they are very real concepts that exist in this world. Brains computing information is not well defined and who is to say what counts as computation or not? What arrangements of particle movements in the universe deserve to produce consciousness or not? The universe saying that the nervous system of creatures should be linked to consciousness the same way an electron is linked to its charge is a stretch.

No.  It's only circular if that assumption asserts its own truth.  But my assumption does *not* assert its own truth.  It is quite possible that there could turn out be *evidence* that evidence is not a reliable guide to truth!  In fact, this actually happens!  My own conscious experience (and that of most humans) includes such evidence: we call those experiences ""dreams"".  We distinguish between dreams and reality precisely because dreams do not seem to be a reliable guide to any sort of truth.  This is the reason I don't give much weight to the evidence provided by my dreams.  Instead I ""explain it away"" by saying that dreams are a sort of trick that my brain plays on my while I'm asleep.  They aren't real.  If my entire existence were as incoherent as my dreams I would have to abandon my assumption that evidence is a reliable guide to truth and figure out some other way to live my life.  But it isn't.  When I'm awake, the evidence assembles itself quite coherently and allows me to tell a story about it which in turn gives me a lot of leverage and power over my existence.

Those fundamental laws correspond to fundamental particles and space time. The linkages between a particle and its numerical mass and numerical charge are very simple and are explained by particles simply having intrinsic properties. On the other hand, an emotion being linked to a computation makes less sense. A computation in the brain that makes someone feel angry could be produced by a variety of different arrangements of the material in the brain that look nothing a like. The universe would have to search through an archive of possible angry brain configurations then assign this emotion to it. 

&gt;Functionalism is questionable, as it suggests a non-physical phenomenon can cause physical events.  This seems to violate conservation of energy  in a way that's opposed to what physical theories.

&gt; So, on what basis are you demanding an explanation for the supervenience relation?  This doesn't get us to God without cosmological arguments. 

I demand an explanation on how conscious thoughts supervene on particle interactions. I think that elements of primary experience are crisp and easy to understand. The color red is red, feeling sad is sad, etcetera. They are hard to define in language because of an explanatory gap. However, they are very real concepts that exist in this world. Brains computing information is not well defined and who is to say what counts as computation or not? What arrangements of particle movements in the universe deserve to produce consciousness or not? The universe saying that the nervous system of creatures should be linked to consciousness the same way an electron is linked to its charge is a stretch. I think it only works if God, who sees humans as different from a rock, decides to link conscious thought to it.",1578425785
t1_fdhfkm7,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;You're taking comfort in knowing the truth from a very odd source.  You told me that you take the truth of the Bible as an assumption.  The Bible then in turn tells you that it is the truth, but that's just a circular argument.

All reasoning has to go back to a primary axiom that is unprovable and on which all else rests.  In that regard, all reasoning is 'circular' when you go back to the most fundamental level. The only alternative to this would be to have an infinite regress of justifications, which would be impossible.

&gt;I could just as easily add ""Science tells us the truth "" as one of my assumptions and then I too would know the truth according to my own assumptions. But I'm guessing you would consider that to be intellectually dishonest (and I would agree).

Actually that is what you already said you were doing. But the problem with that of course is that science is not a worldview, it's just a tool of investigation. It is meaningless without a worldview from which it operates. Like software that requires an operating system.

&gt;But doesn't it make you feel good knowing that you're saved, that you are a member of the Elect?

Yes, as well it should. But this is not an idea of my own making, and its truth is not dependent on how I feel about it. Neither is the truth of eternal hell dependent upon how anybody feels about it.

&gt;So here's a theory: maybe the reason I don't believe is that God doesn't want me to because He knows that if I were to become a believer that I would be so persuasive that I would actually be able to make it the prevailing world view. (And if you think that's too self-aggrandizing, replace ""I"" with ""atheists in general"".) Maybe God *needs* atheists (and heretics) because without us, True Christianity would take over and prove itself to be false. So we're part of His Plan. Does that sound plausible to you?

It's plausible, but God is able to work through people's free choices, so even if that is true you are no less culpable for your actions, and you are no less free to modify them in order to receive God's mercy.

&gt;No. The planet has to be a rigid body if you're going to a use a point on its surface as a reference. If it's not a rigid body, then different parts of it can spin at different rates.

Nobody said anything about using a point directly on the surface of a solid body. The vantage point would be somewhere suspended in the atmosphere above a generalized place on the surface, such that the rising and setting of the light source with respect to that vantage point would be visible. Do you deny that sunrise and sunset are visible from a cruise ship out in the middle of the ocean?

&gt;Also, how do you know that earth was spinning at the same rate in the past as it is now?

I don't think it was, exactly. It would have been slightly faster then, as the speed of earth's rotation is gradually declining over time due to entropy.

&gt;I thought you said that you don't accept uniformitarianism.

I accept the Bible's history, and God directly states in Exodus 20:11 that the days of creation were equivalent to the 6 day work week of the Israelites.

&gt;Because I'm a native Hebrew speaker so I can tell you with some authority that the word in Genesis 1:1 is ""ha-aretz"", not ""eretz"", and it doesn't mean ""dry land"".

Nobody is a native speaker of ancient biblical Hebrew. You may well be a native speaker of modern Hebrew, but languages change. This particular language was artificially resurrected after being dead for thousands of years, which means technically there isn't even a direct lineage between any native speakers today and the original biblical author.

According to Strong's, the word in question in verse 2 is indeed ""eretz"". The fact that the vowel shifts when used in conjunction with ""ha"" does not mean it is a different word. Here are all the various ways this word can be translated:

&gt;common (1), countries (15), countries and their lands (1), country (44), countryside (1), distance\* (3), dust (1), earth (655), earth the ground (1), earth's (1), fail\* (1), floor (1), ground (119), land (1581), lands (57), lands have their land (2), open (1), other\* (2), piece (1), plateau\* (1), region (1), territories (1), wild (1), world (3).

[https://biblehub.com/hebrew/776.htm](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/776.htm)

To be precise, there is no single word in ancient Hebrew that directly corresponds to our English word ""planet"", and the Bible was written to be accessible to all audiences including the pre-scientific ones, so it does not teach any particular view of cosmology. You don't have to understand that the world is round in order to understand Genesis 1. I do believe it is perfectly consistent with the language to interpret verse two as a reference to the land, not to the planet as a whole.

&gt;The word for ""dry land"" is ""yabashah"", which is what God creates on the third day.

The text nowhere states that God created land on the third day. It states that the land appeared as a result of the waters being gathered in one place. The verb used is ""raah"".

[https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7200.htm](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7200.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The word ""eretz"" does not appear until verse 10: ""And God called the dry land \[yabashah\] earth \[eretz\].""

Eretz is the same word used in 1:2- the earth was without form and void.

&gt;Then you don't believe in the Bible, because that is very clearly not what the Bible says.

""Eretz"" means ""land"" in the sense of ""nation"", as in ""eretz Israel"", which means ""the land of Israel"" or ""the nation of Israel"".  ""Aretz"" (the ""ha"" just means ""the"", but in Hebrew ""the"" is a prefix, not a separate word) means ""earth"" or ""world"", as in ""Ha-aretz"", the Israeli newspaper.  The word for ""dry land"" is ""yabashah"", which is what God creates on the third day.  (The word ""yabashah"" literally means ""dryness"".  It's a derivative of the word ""yavesh"" which means ""dry"".)

The word ""eretz"" does not appear until verse 10: ""And God called the dry land [yabashah] earth [eretz].""

This is an exercise in semantics. Some of our english words may designate things that cross baramins, but many do not. Again, this is a holistic question, and must be answered on a case-by-case basis.

Under Naturalism, evolution fits as a phenomena that came about naturally.

Under Creationism, evolution and all other described scientific work happens under the Creation of God. Whether or not someone accepts evolution, relativity, electrochemical reactions... all of those things are created by God.

You are trying, very poorly, to claim that evolution makes a claim it does not make by saying that some naturalists who are evolutionists have no basis for morals. Naturalists actually do have morals. Morality is largely a human construct. Naturalists are capable of being good people. Creationists have morals as well.

True Christianity has a rather unique quality, in that if it were ever to become the prevailing worldview it would invalidate itself. The Bible says that God has made foolish the wisdom of this world. It says that not many of the wise according this world are called. It says that the first will be last, and the last will be first. It says that God's power is made perfect in weakness.

&gt;And what if I pick the South Pole?

Then you'll get a good view of the hollow earth. Just kidding. But that's obviously not the vantage point that God picked, and God is the one who matters here.

&gt;BTW, how do you pick a vantage point on the first day? There was no land, that didn't appear until the third day. The earth wasn't even round yet, it was ""without form and void"".

Interesting question. First of all, the presence of land is irrelevant. All we need is for the planet to be spinning. It doesn't even need to be round technically speaking. But that ""without form and void"" refers to ""eretz"" (the earth/land), so how do you know that statement doesn't simply refer to the land rather than the planet as a whole?

You stated that God created the land on day 3, and most Christians I think do believe that. I also used to believe that until recently. But the text doesn't state that the land was created on Day 3, it it says that it was made to appear at that time as a result of gathering the waters together.

I believe God created the land on Day 1 (Gen 1:1). Again, there's room for disagreement on that, but my personal view is that the ""without form and void"" description refers to the land which was in some way being shrouded by the waters until it was revealed on day 3. None of this precludes the idea of a spherical earth all throughout the process.

&gt;so you're going to have to explain some things that may seem obvious to you but aren't to me.

That is a major problem. But that is not a problem shared by those who start with the truth of Scripture as their 'Primary Axiom'. If we are created by God for the purpose of understanding, then we can be confident on that basis that we do possess an innate capacity to rightly understand basic truths.

I agree. That one best worldview is biblical Christianity.

&gt;It doesn't have a beginning or an end. 

That's not true. Do you really think this planet has always been spinning, and it always will? According to the Bible God did start the process, and he will also end it.

&gt;Even if you look at the actual text in Genesis it doesn't make sense:

&gt;""There was evening and there was morning, one day.""

It's possible that God created the universe 6000 years ago.  It's also possible that Loki (the Norse god of mischief, not the Marvel comics character) created the universe last Thursday.  I cannot definitively rule out any of those possibilities.  I am a finite being who can only ever process a finite amount of data, and any finite amount of data will always be consistent with an infinite number of theories.

But among all the possible theories that are consistent with the data, one stands out as being better than all the others because it minimizes the amount of *arbitrariness*.  Take last-Thursdayism for example.  Why Thursday?  Why not Wednesday?  Why *last* thursday instead of the one before that?

The reason I reject last-Thursdayism is not because I can prove it's wrong, but because it is one of an infinite family of theories, each of which is indistinguishable from the other.  One of them might be true, but *at most* one of them is true.  So unless I have some basis for discerning which one of the myriad possibilities is actually true the odds that I'm going to pick the right one are indistinguishable from zero.  So I reject them all.

The reason I reject Christianity is similar, but more complicated and nuanced.  I'm happy to tell you if you want to know, but I thought I'd stop here to make sure that what I've said to this point makes sense.

&gt; &gt; But ""evening"" and ""morning"" are phenomenological.

&gt; They may be, but that is beside the point. If you admit they are phenomenological than you also are admitting that they refer to a phenomenon. And what is that phenomenon? The start and end of a literal day defined as the spinning of the earth in one rotation.

But that definition doesn't work.  The spinning of the earth is a constant process.  It doesn't have a beginning or an end.  When does the day start?  The answer is different depending on where you happen to be.  (And if you're at one of the poles the question literally does not have an answer.  Likewise if you're out in space.)  Even if you're standing at one spot away from the poles the answer to the question ""when does the day start"" is arbitrary.  Does it start at midnight?  At sunrise?  What about during daylight savings time?

Even if you look at the actual text in Genesis it doesn't make sense:

""There was evening and there was morning, one day.""

But evening and morning are not absolute phenomena.  It's always evening somewhere and it's always morning somewhere.  (The flat-earthers, BTW, use this to argue that the earth must be flat.)

In 2011, Samoa changed time zones.  That change moved it from one side of the international date line to the other.

https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/samoa-dateline.html

Does that mean that everyone in Samoa is now keeping the Sabbath on the wrong day (or that they were doing it wrong before)?  When colonists set up shop on Mars, how should they observe the fourth Commandment?  Do they use Mars days (24.5 hours) or Earth days?

It's never complicated when you oversimplify it. We may grant that your body can do the things you listed (though technically you cannot even claim to know THAT), but again you simply beg the question when you state that your brain is able to acquire knowledge. How do you know that? You have no basis for assuming it.

&gt;if the state of my brain somehow corresponds with reality, then I say that I know something about reality. Again, not complicated.

But you are stuck within the confines of your own brain, so you never get beyond the ""state of your brain"". You are simply begging the question when you claim that your brain state matches reality. You don't have access to reality directly. Everything you think you know has been filtered through your allegedly non-designed brain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But ""evening"" and ""morning"" are phenomenological.

They may be, but that is beside the point. If you admit they are phenomenological than you also are admitting that they refer to a phenomenon. And what is that phenomenon? The start and end of a literal day defined as the spinning of the earth in one rotation.

&gt;Not only that, they are relative to specific locations on the earth's surface. When is evening? When is morning? It depends on where you are.

Sure, but that's why both evening and morning are specified, followed by the ordinal number of days that had elapsed. That makes it absolutely clear.

t1_fddlerb,lisper,"&gt; Your brain wasn't designed for knowing truth, so you have no grounds for thinking that it is remotely capable of such action.

My brain wasn't designed at all, neither was my body.  Nonetheless, both my brain and my body are able to do things.  My body is able to acquire food, construct shelter, make clothing, and my brain is able to acquire knowledge, and both of these are possible because both advance my reproductive fitness.  It's really not complicated.

&gt; It is absolutely true to say ""the sun rises in the east"", because that is an example of phenomenological language from a human vantage point.

I can say exactly the same thing about acquiring knowledge.  Knowing something is phenomenological: if the state of my brain somehow corresponds with reality, then I say that I know something about reality.  Again, not complicated.

&gt; Genesis 1 is not just a figure of speech like saying ""the four winds"" or ""the four corners of the earth"" or ""I am the door"".

A great deal of the YEC worldview (as I understand it) turns on the meaning of phrases like ""the evening and the morning were the first day.""  But ""evening"" and ""morning"" are phenomenological.  Not only that, they are relative to specific locations on the earth's surface.  When is evening?  When is morning?  It depends on where you are.  So it seems to me have a bit of a double standard here with regards to when a claim is phenomenological and when it is ""objectively true"".

BTW, the objective truth of the universe is quantum-mechanical, so nearly everything we say about reality in everyday language is objectively false.  It's *all* phenomenological, even such ""fundamental truths"" as ""matter is made of atoms"".

t1_fd419zv,jmscwss,"&gt; Its a scientific theory.

A theory of universal origination is not scientific, because, whilst scientific theories are, by definition, testable, repeatable, falsifiable, etc., universal origination is none of those things.  The most the scientific method could ever show is that the universe *could have* originated in such a way.  The scientific method can never rule out supernatural causes, and thus can never rule out a supernatural cause of the universe.

Remember, the credibility of the scientific method is tied to its predictive and technological success.  Its virtue is that it gives us a window into the future (by telling us what things will do in certain circumstances), not the past.  To the extent that scientific findings can illuminate questions regarding the past, again, forensic analyses can only tell us how events *could have* happened, given the natural powers inhering in the things of our experience.  All forensic practices, whether biological, financial, or whatever, are only useful as a bolster (or falsifier) to some form of independent testimony.  And, again, no scientific forensic method can possibly falsify a testimony of supernatural causation.  

Beliefs about origins is thus an aspect of religion.  Values and moral teachings are also aspects of philosophy and religion, it is true.  But a teaching about universal origins is a religious teaching, falling outside the scope of science.",1578323637
t1_fdd3aa3,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;That's true, but all else being equal, genes that build brains that can discern objective truth have better odds of survival than genes that build brains that suffer from delusions or otherwise cannot discern fantasy from reality.

How can you claim to know that? You are stuck using your non-intelligently-designed brain to make that statement. It may only be helpful for you, or all of us, to think that way for reproduction purposes. Your brain wasn't designed for knowing truth, so you have no grounds for thinking that it is remotely capable of such action.

&gt;BTW, it's not actually true that the sun rises in the east. The sun does not rise at all. What happens is that the earth revolves about its axis, which makes it look as if the sun is rising to someone standing on its surface, even though it really isn't. But my belief that the sun rises in the east allows me to effectively navigate the world (literally!) as long as I'm standing on its surface. So it doesn't really matter that this is not ""objective truth"". It's still effective knowledge.

It is absolutely true to say ""the sun rises in the east"", because that is an example of phenomenological language from a human vantage point. It is not a literal cosmological statement, so to say it is ""not true"" would be to abuse the intent of the phrase itself.

&gt;So why is Genesis 1 rigidly literal and the ""four corners"" not? (You do know that the flat-earthers actually cite those passages in support of their position yes?)

Many reasons. Genesis 1 is not just a figure of speech like saying ""the four winds"" or ""the four corners of the earth"" or ""I am the door"". It is an entire chapter of a book, and it is written in the style of hebrew historical narrative, not in the style of poetry. There is no internal indication whatsoever that it is intended to be understood as anything other than literal history, and the rest of the Bible including Jesus himself interprets it as literal history. The flat earthers are a cult group that abuses the Bible just like other cult groups do. Their own model doesn't even include a square earth!

&gt;Yes, of course. The original title of the group was actually going to be ""Bible study for atheists.""

Biblically, the church is defined as the body of Christ- the assembly of believers. Having an unbeliever teach a class on the Bible at a church is antithetical to everything the church is supposed to be about. It's a real shame.

&gt;I do know that the church openly welcomes non-believers.

t3_ekogdd,NeatIdea,"That video starts with a completely inaccurate assumption stated as fact, that the pyramids were built 2550 BC.

The dating of those time periods is due to acceptance of a chronology supposedly written in the 3rd century BC that we do not even have original copies of.

Further the order and dating of these Egyptian dynasties is known to be wrong even amongst the heathen.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties\_of\_Ancient\_Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasties_of_Ancient_Egypt)

&gt;""While widely used and useful, the system does have its shortcomings. Some dynasties only ruled part of Egypt and existed concurrently with other dynasties based in other cities. The Seventh might not have existed at all, the Tenth seems to be a continuation of the Ninth \[sic\], and there might have been one or several Upper Egyptian Dynasties before the First Dynasty.""

How is it that one can argue for hours about science, but accepts secular historical dating which is full of contradictions without question?

People wonder why [Imhotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep), who I take to be Joseph, is supposedly not mentioned for 1200 years following his death. Perhaps because the dating of Djoser (Joseph's) Pharoah is out by about 1200 years.

Saqqara is where Djoser's pyramid was built and where the grain stores were, and the great pyramid shortly followed it. Joseph lived long enough to oversee the building of this great pyramid, which I attribute to the wisdom he received from God. Fixing this dating of Djoser, seems to make everything line up with the biblical at least approximately. I have not worked through the details.

Akhnaten, I take to be the converted son of Pharaoh who lost his brother to the plague of the death of the firstborn and his dad in the Red Sea. Akhnaten's memory was later erased in a rewriting of history, which should serve as a memory that history is often rewritten.

Akhnaten is supposed to follow Amenhotep who is supposed to follow the Thutmoses. If you remember that Moses was named by Pharaoh's daughter, these things should begin to line up with the history of the bible.

The rewriting of history is in prophecy also:

&gt;Daniel 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and **think to change times** and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

So it is not fair to the biblical account to assume otherwise.

The same passage talks about corruption of the bible ""think to change times **and laws**"", which leads to a discussion of the septuagint.

&gt;Titus 1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;  
&gt;  
&gt;1:14 Not giving heed to **Jewish fables**, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

The apocrypha is unreliable. The word has even come to mean that.

Why should a critical or unbelieving scholar be trusted to tell believers what is in their bibles and where they come from?

Who do you believe the scribes or God?

&gt;Luke 20:46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;  
&gt;  
&gt;20:47 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.

The two hundred and fifteen years that Israel were in Egypt for, I believe is correct. But this is according to biblical chronology not against it.

&gt;Exodus 12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

So what? The early church lived thousands of years closer to the events, and they did not teach or believe that. If they copied Mark they did it very poorly, since they fail to match up perfectly.

What you need to learn how to do is to take off your unbelieving worldview ""glasses"" and start to listen to what God is telling you, rather than trying to decide what God should be telling you.

I appreciate it. If that's the case, though, then don't just jump from one atheist talking point to another. I've heard them all, believe it or not. I'm not a flat earther, and the Bible is not full of contradictions. The authors of the Bible didn't just die because they were raised to believe in Jesus. In fact none of them had been raised as Christians.

No, it was not based on ""nothing at all"".  Those passages are very, very similar.

Such as?

As for the rest of your post, I fail to see how the building of cities somehow proves the Bible is skipping generations (though again this is ruled out because every father is accounted for having a son, even furthermore at a specific age). 

I think you're confusing generations with specific people. Not all sons of all men are mentioned. Noah's sons had sons who had sons and so on. It's really just exponential growth. Back then you'd be living for hundreds of years and have many children so why is it surprising Noah's grandchildren founded what would become great cities? This is irrelevant to knowing the age of the Earth though because the sons we do know of, we still know the age of the fathers at their birth

Edit: I kept trying to understand where your confusion might be and I think it's possible you're confused in thinking if there's only 16 grandsons, how can there be cities? This maybe where you're confused. Each grandson indeed went on to found cities filled with their sons and their sons of sons and such. They clearly didn't create giant cities by their generation (in other words, when there was 20 people on Earth) but went on to create great cities.

Second it is clear from the text is that generations are sometimes being skipped, this is from a plain reading for Genesis 10

6 The sons of Ham:
Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan.
7 The sons of Cush:
Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka.
The sons of Raamah:
Sheba and Dedan.
8 Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth. 9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.” 10 The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.11 From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah 12 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city. 

so points that matter here are 

(a) it talks about civilizations (Egypt, Cush, Canan) it's more likely that it is referring to ancestor of civilizations than direct ancestor of people 

(b) Going from Noah and his 3 sons to building great cities by the time of Noah's Great Grandsons only makes sense if the bible is skipping generations and wants us to know it 

the bible says Cush begat Nimrod who: 

&gt; The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.11 From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah 12 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city. 

Think about this for a moment - Noah had 3 sons who in total according to the bible had  16 sons - meaning there were only 20 men on earth at the time including Noah, his sons and his grandsons.  

Just one generation after that, noah's great grand son Nimroad goes to found the cities of Babylon, Uruk Ninevah, along with the Akkadian and other cities which the bible says is a ""Great city."" So how do you go from 20 men on earth to building several great cities just a generation later?  It only makes sense if you were skipping generations which is what the plain reading suggests

perhaps the x begat y formula you are using is correct, but the x begat y terminology is used from Cush to Nimrod in the KJV not sure about original but it does use very similar terminology for Sephs direct decendents Arphaxad Salah . . . in Genesis 10, which is substituted with begat in Genesis 11",1578203790

t3_ek8g7b,brokensheep," 19th century geologist and lawyer Charles Lyell (1797–1875) is renowned for popularizing the idea that the world’s geology reflected an old age of the earth (i.e. much older than the Bible’s 6,000-year timeframe of history), thus paving the way and providing some traction for Charles Darwin’s evolutionary ideas.

But was Charles Lyell truly viewing the rocks from a scientifically objective perspective?

In his private correspondence, Lyell admitted to the strongly anti-biblical (“anti-Mosaical”) nature of his ideas. In 1829, just a few months prior to the publication of the first volume of his *Principles of Geology*, Lyell wrote, in a letter to fellow old-earth geologist Roderick Murchison:

&gt;I trust I shall make my sketch of the progress of geology popular. Old \[Rev. John\] Fleming is frightened and thinks the age will not stand my anti-Mosaical conclusions and at least that the subject will for a time become unpopular and awkward for the clergy, but I am not afraid. I shall out with the whole but in as conciliatory a manner as possible.

Edward Bailey’s biography of Charles Lyell writes that at that time, “A few days in Paris allowed Lyell to enjoy a lecture by Prévost ‘on diluvium and caves, a good logical refutation of the diluvian humbug’.”

By the following year, we see that Charles Lyell has a clear agenda, i.e. to “free the science from Moses”. That is what Lyell wrote on 14th June 1830 in a letter to George Poulett Scrope:

&gt;I am sure you may get into Q.R. \[*Quarterly Review*\] what will **free the science from Moses**, for if treated seriously, the \[church\] party are quite prepared for it. A bishop, Buckland ascertained (we suppose \[Bishop\] Sumner), gave Ure a dressing in the *British Critic and Theological Review*. They see at last the mischief and scandal brought on them by Mosaic systems … . Probably there was a beginning—it is a metaphysical question, worthy of a theologian—probably there will be an end. Species, as you say, have begun and ended—but the analogy is faint and distant. Perhaps it is an analogy, but all I say is, there are, as Hutton said, ‘no signs of a beginning, no prospect of an end’ … . All I ask is, that at any given period of the past, don’t stop inquiry when puzzled by refuge to a ‘beginning,’ which is all one with ‘another state of nature,’ as it appears to me. But there is no harm in your attacking me, provided you point out that it is the proof I deny, not the probability of a beginning … . I was afraid to point the moral, as much as you can do in the Q.R. about Moses. Perhaps I should have been tenderer about the Koran. Don’t meddle much with that, if at all.  
If we don’t irritate, which I fear that we may (though mere history), we shall carry all with us. If you don’t triumph over them, but compliment the liberality and candour of the present age, the bishops and enlightened saints will join us in despising both the ancient and modern physico-theologians. It is just the time to strike, so rejoice that, sinner as you are, the Q.R. is open to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;P.S. … I conceived the idea five or six years ago \[1824–25\], that if ever the Mosaic geology could be set down without giving offence, it would be in an historical sketch, and you must abstract mine, in order to have as little to say as possible yourself. Let them feel it, and point the moral.”

Lyell, the lawyer *par excellence*, was involved, not in scientific investigation but political game playing to ensure his uniformitarian ideas would be accepted by the church, even though he *knew* they clearly contradicted the plain teaching of Scripture. Lyell’s secretive scheming not only deceived the church to accept his false ideas that undermined the Gospel, but he set geology on a wrong path for over a century, as geologists now recognize:

&gt;“Lyell also sold geology some snake oil. He convinced geologists that … all past processes acted at essentially their current rates (that is, those observed in historical time). This extreme gradualism has led to numerous unfortunate consequences, including the rejection of sudden or catastrophic events in the face of positive evidence for them, for no reason other than that they were not gradual.”",1578201129

t1_fd6w6w0,Footballthoughts,"Not sure what you mean when you say genealogies are ""difficult"". Disagreement among scholars does nothing to argue against the plain meaning of scripture. It's impossible that people were omitted because scripture gives a clear, unbroken list of ""X beget Y"" along with the age of the father at the birth of the son so any hypothetical gaps would be impossible 

The Hebrew word translated as “beget” in the King James Version of the Bible is yalad (ילד). Although it could (in principle) indicate something more distant than a direct parent-child relationship, it is apparently never used that way in the Old Testament. That is, whenever the form “X begat Y” occurs in the Old Testament, it always indicates a direct parent-child relationship. We are aware of no exceptions. The New Testament does sometimes skip generations when using “X begat Y” as mentioned previously. But the New Testament is written in Greek, and is using a different word for “begat” (γενναω). The Old Testament “begats” (which are the ones involved in age-of-the-earth estimations) appear to be airtight—and in many cases, the surrounding passages confirm a direct parent-child relationship.

We know the age of the fathers at the birth of their sons. 

The ages at the birth of each son:
Adam: 130
Seth: 105
Enosh: 90
Cainan: 70
Mahaleleel: 65
Jared: 162
Enoch: 65
Menthuselah: 187
Lamech: 182
Noah: 500

That's 10 generations totaling 1,556 years in Noah's 500th year. We know from Jude 14 that Enoch was seventh from Adam. We know Enoch names his son Menthuselah meaning ""his death shall bring"". We know if we do the math Menthuselah dies the year of the flood. 

This makes it impossible to fit in millions of years or even hundreds of thousands into the Bible.

Of course from there we can know the years from Noah to Abraham (around 500), Abraham to Jesus (around 1500) and Jesus to now (around 2000)",1578196980

No worries mate. Your reactions are invariably worth the wait :)

&gt;I think creating Adam and Eve homologous for every gene (without created heterozygosity) would be poor design and would greatly reduce adaptability.

May I rebut that creating only a single couple is then *also* poor design? I don't see the point of this kind of argument. No creationist ever pins his colours to the mast on the nature of the designer's purpose, which is the main reason why creationism isn't a scientific theory of design.

Either you use arguments of the kind ""I don't think a creator would do x"", in which case I want to know exactly what kind of creator you have in mind and how you can infer his purpose and design, so that I can also use flaws as a counter-argument... or you don't. 

&gt;I've seen it suggested that mtDNA dates often don't match other clocks from archaeology: ""there is a severe shortage of such uncontroversial episodes that can be unambiguously tied to particular instances of mtDNA variation.""

Is *that* your take-away from the article you linked? That's not even what the bit *you quoted* says.

In that paragraph they point out that the archaeological calibration points that have been suggested are either archaeologically controversial or not sufficiently linked to mtDNA variation, and then immediately go on to argue that there are a few archaeological events which do meet both criteria, and that these are in broad accordance with their corrected mt-DNA estimates.

I have genuinely no idea why you linked that. I haven't read it all yet (I will though) but it seems to be strong evidence for exactly what I'm arguing.

&gt;But it's consistent with both the bible and population genetics.

You haven't shown this. How does population genetics predict that every relevant phenotypic difference between these species should have reached fixation in a matter of decades? And where do you see historical evidence for a geographic spread? They both appear all over the Middle East.

Remember, our economic records show that the price of mules was much higher than any other equid almost immediately after the TOB (3x as high in the Hittite empire IIRC). This suggests 1) infertility, 2) the coexistence of horses and donkeys (contra your geographic spread) and 3) significant morphological or behavioural advantages over both horses and donkeys/onagers.

And is it difficult to test? You say the molecular clock differences accumulate over the past 4000 years (I'm not sure why you make that concession - couldn't that be created heterozygosity too?) so that's simply resolved by DNA-testing archaeological equid remains, isn't it?",1578195426

On donkeys, horses, zebras:  I think a YEC would argue:

1.  The phenotype altering alleles separating the equid species were either part of the original creation or happened since the flood.

2.  Shortly after the flood, small equid populations spreading out geographically led to founder effects that led to the species-specific traits and chromosome counts.

3.  The molecular clock differences accumulated since then over the last 4000 years.  Or perhaps longer if we're talking about nuclear DNA differences.

They are not word-for-word identical! You lied. Of course there are parallel passages, and anybody educated on the Bible knows that. You claimed there were lengthy tracts of Scripture that are word-for-word the same between the gospels.

&gt;Their reaction was: great, you're a Christian now, so you should read the Bible. And so I did. And the more I read, the more I became convinced that it could not possibly be the work of an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity. 

This shows your arrogance goes back very far. If you really believed as you claim you did, then rather than concluding there was a problem with the Bible, you should have rightly concluded that since this was God's word, there must be a problem with you in some way if something didn't add up in your mind. You should have prayed for God to show you the answers to your questions and clear up your misgivings. Instead you concluded that you knew better than God, right off the bat.

I'm not asking it to.  But we know that Paul wrote because he started out by saying, essentially, ""Hi everyone, this is Paul talking.""

&gt; John referred to himself cryptically as ""the disciple whom Jesus loved"", but that is no indication he didn't write it.

We'll have to agree to disagree about that.

&gt; Is this how you're going to address the fact that you have repeatedly strawmanned my argument about the eyewitness testimonies of the apostles?

No, this is me explaining to you that I'm not ""strawmanning"" your argument.  What is going on here is that I've done a lot of reading and my mind is ""poisoned"" not just by science, but also by Biblical scholarship.  So I don't know how to distinguish a ""revisionist scoffer"" from a trustworthy source.  You may have to start at ground zero with me.

&gt; &gt; Do I at least get credit for not being completely ignorant of the contents of the Bible?

&gt; Of course you get no credit for that.

Hm, interesting.

&gt; In fact it is the opposite: your knowledge of the Bible only serves to make you that much more culpable in your rejection of it

So let me tell you a story: when I was twelve, my parents sent me to a YMCA summer camp.  After two weeks of relentless proseletyzing, I finally relented and gave myself over to Jesus.  It was wonderful.  I felt the Presence of the Holy Spirit.  I went home and told my parents the good news.  Their reaction was: great, you're a Christian now, so you should read the Bible.  And so I did.  And the more I read, the more I became convinced that it could not possibly be the work of an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity.  I reached this conclusion all on my own, and I take full responsibility for it.

But here's the thing: if God had wanted to, he could have steered me back to the right path when I was twelve.  He could have spoken to me.  He could have showed me a miracle.  He could have made my path cross with someone who could answer my questions.  He didn't.  I actually wanted to believe in Him.  In fact, I *did* believe in Him for a little while.  And the thing that made me stop believing in Him was reading what is supposedly His Word.

If God wants me back, he can have me any time any time he wants.  All he has to do is explain to me why I'm wrong.  He can do it himself, or he can do it through an emissary.  But without that explanation, I can't believe in him.  It's not that I won't, I literally can't.  As in unable.  Summoning faith in God in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary is not something I am capable of.

&gt;  But my spending time trying to explain things to you and untangle your fallacies does not seem to be helping in the least.

t1_fd4u8mz,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; Ah. So it's not just the scientists who have it wrong, it's also the Biblical scholars?

Not all scholars, but the revisionist scoffers who have an antibiblical agenda are certainly wrong. Whom will I trust? Those historians who lived thousands of years closer to the events themselves, or modern-day scoffers who want to ignore nearly everything the early historians had to say? I know my answer to this. 

&gt;Enlighten me then: who wrote Genesis? Was it an eyewitness account?

Moses wrote Genesis under divine revelation from God, therefore it is an eyewitness account from God through Moses as the human author.

&gt;Who wrote Matthew and Luke?

You answered your own questions.

&gt; If these are independent eyewitness accounts, how do you account for the fact that long passages of Matthew and Luke are word-for-word identical to Mark and to each other?

I don't know if that's a true statement in the first place [cite your source for this claim], but granting that it is, what might imply is the possibility that these independent authors may have drawn certain common elements from a pre-existing source and then added their own experiences and insights to fill out their own versions of events. It need not imply any kind of dishonesty or forgery whatsoever.

&gt; If Matthew is a first-hand eyewitness account, why does Matthew refer to himself in the third person (Mat 9:9)?

Authors can sometimes do this, and in any case you cannot force ancient literature to conform to modern-day sensibilities. John referred to himself cryptically as ""the disciple whom Jesus loved"", but that is no indication he didn't write it.

&gt;Why does Luke say that he is writing an account of ""those things which are most surely believed among us"" rather than, say, ""those things which I have witnessed with my own eyes""?

Luke's gospel is a little different in that Luke was a traveling companion of the disciples and acted as a contemporaneous historian, compiling events and narrative elements. Luke didn't claim to witness everything firsthand himself, but he did talk to the people who did. This is an extremely powerful historical source, even without assuming its divine inspiration.

&gt;I'm going the best I can with what I've got.

Not even sure what to make of this statement. Are you just openly admitting to being intellectually dishonest? Is this how you're going to address the fact that you have repeatedly strawmanned my argument about the eyewitness testimonies of the apostles? You already admitted that you have no problem accepting that the earliest Christians died for their faith. But there's a crucial difference between those and your red herring examples. These people were in a position to know if their testimonies were true, or if they were in fact lying. If they were lying, it is inconceivable that they would have underwent torture for these lies rather than simply admitting they were lies in order to save their own lives.

&gt;Do I at least get credit for not being completely ignorant of the contents of the Bible?

Of course you get no credit for that. In fact it is the opposite: your knowledge of the Bible only serves to make you that much more culpable in your rejection of it and your suppression of the truth. As Jesus said:

**Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.**

By saying you are knowledgeable about the Bible, you are showing that your heart is truly hardened to the word of God, and that you will probably not be a fruitful person for dialogue. And so far, you really have not been. You just keep throwing out fallacies. Is there any hope for you to snap out of it and just humble yourself before God? I don't know. But my spending time trying to explain things to you and untangle your fallacies does not seem to be helping in the least.",1578177136

Depends on your definition of evolution, not that I am advocating for that in any way.

&gt;Just like believing in creation doesn't make you a better Christian.

This I disagree with as the Bible described the Messiah to be the Creator incarnate. To not believe this would be a fundamental departure from the Messiah's message and intent.

This might lead me to question as it would be fallacy to conclude that being a spiritual Evolutionist equates to accepting the Creator.

&gt;...it seems to me to be hard to make evolution [sic] and the type of theism we see in Christianity compatible in a logical way.

I'd say impossible.. 

Consider that you would have to presume billions of years over the clear text of Genesis 1 and 2. While there are more progressive (or gap) theists every year doesn't necessarily make them right.. they could be compromising their faith in the Bible.

I don't see any way to for naturalistic atheism to be compatible with original Christianity, and while I don't subscribe to evolutionism on scientific grounds I could see why it might be convenient to in modern church philosophy.

t1_fcuqvt8,ThurneysenHavets,"Hey, thanks for responding.

First off, I should clarify that I'm not exactly on the fence on this issue. I say this not because I'm not openminded - I'm always open to be persuaded that I'm wrong - but because your comment seems to assume I'm *trying* to debunk evolution and if you think I'm a passive learner here I wouldn't want to waste your time. I am currently of the view that the scientific evidence for evolution and an old earth is extremely robust.

However, if you want to discuss the evidence and convince me otherwise I'm all for that :)

Your video is long but I watched substantial parts of it. The discussion of time dilation basically boils down to the idea that six days elapse on earth while billions of years elapse elsewhere. Leaving the problems with that kind of idea to one side, it does not solve the radiometric dating problem. Only six days elapsed on earth, so radiometric clocks should not give (any) old dates here. They do, and they agree on *how* old. This is a problem any YEC model needs to address and I've never come across a model which does.

If I'm not mistaken your video nowhere addresses radiometric dating (other than c14, which only works on recent artefacts anyway).

On other subjects, your video makes some pretty basic errors, which I'm afraid is quite usual for young creationist resources - one of the reasons why I think YEC is wrong. I'll just list a few that I picked up:

- Not all stalagmites/stalactites are the same and stalagmites forming naturally in caves (from calcium carbonate) can't just be compared with stalagmites forming from gypsum or concrete and mortar. Trying this anyway is a very bad error, even despite the fact that the formation of stalagmites isn't really a dating method we use to begin with.

- The Carlsbad Cavern sign change is one of those commonly circulated factoids that I haven't been able to back up from a good source (I just tried again). Note that the age of the limestone bed is 250my but that does not mean the caverns are the same age, so it's quite possible that signs were changed without any of the underlying science changing. I'd need a good source for that.

- Similarly, I'd want a source that those planes were actually under so many *layers* of ice. You can't just extrapolate from feet to layers. These planes were buried near the coast where snow-fall is heavier, and ice cores aren't taken from glaciers. We're very sure that the ice core layers are annual because they reflect seasonal changes in the composition of the ice.

- The old C14 dates for living animals are due to the reservoir effect (due to dead marine carbon), which is well understood and taken into account when dating old artefacts.

- The reference given by your video for the Vollosovitch mammoth is erroneous: I checked it. Pewe 1975 page 30 does not mention this. These are evidently citations that creationists are passing on without reading them themselves, which is very poor academic practice but I fear quite typical of many YEC organisations. Check out my comment history if you want a link to it (I found the same erroneous reference in Hovind's work).

- Fossil fuels vary in C14 content. Your video is incorrect to claim that no fossil fuels are carbon-dead. If you want to know why we're so certain that carbondating specifically works I can give you a brief write-up.

- The population growth thing is a really bad argument from every point of view and I have no idea why it's still being made. Population growth isn't just exponential and you can't average it out like that. Population would be expected to reach a much lower equilibrium in hunter-gatherer societies as opposed to agricultural or industrial societies and we've only been industrial for a century or two.

- The beginning of recorded history is complicated and presupposes the existence of various factors, like a sedentary agricultural society with an economic need for writing systems. Just stating that it should go back tens or hundreds of thousands of years isn't an argument.

- The oldest living things are only a few thousand years old. This is another argument I just don't get. The oldest humans are only just over a 100 years old: that does not mean the earth was created in the early twentieth century.

You just cannot help but keep up with the fallacies, can you? This is again yet another strawman, even after I took pains to explain it to you! It is not merely that they died ""for their beliefs"". It is the fact that they died for their own eyewitness testimonies! They were so convinced that they saw Jesus alive after three days that they were willing to give their lives for him, and for the truth of those things they witnessed firsthand. Muslims dying for their cult beliefs are simply in no way comparable to that.

&gt; The authors of the bible ... died under torturous conditions rather than renounce the truth of their own eyewitness testimony.

No, they didn't.  The authors of the Bible are mostly unknown.

Nonetheless, I do not doubt that the early Christians died for their beliefs.  But if that were the criterion for ascertaining truth then I'd have to lend just as much weight to Islam because Muslims have also died for their beliefs.  In fact, in the modern era I see a lot more Muslims dying for their beliefs than I see Christians dying for theirs.  Just because someone believes something passionately enough to die for it doesn't make it true.

t3_ejx0ia,bevets,"Hence, Huxley saw the need to found his own church, and evolution was the ideal cornerstone. It offered a story of origins, one that (thanks to progress) puts humans at the center and top and that could even provide moral messages. The philosopher Herbert Spencer was a great help here. He was ever ready to urge his fellow Victorians that the way to true virtue lies through progress, which comes from promoting a struggle in society as well as in biology--a laissez-faire socioeconomic philosophy. Thus, evolution had its commandments no less than did Christianity. And so Huxley preached evolution-as-world-view at working men's clubs, from the podia during presidential addresses, and in debates with clerics--notably Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford. He even aided the founding of new cathedrals of evolution, stuffed with displays of dinosaurs newly discovered in the American West.

And this way, you can really convince yourself you are right, because you can withstand the arguments of the ""best"" the other side has to offer and not be convinced. Nevermind that you don't bother to deal honestly with any of those arguments to begin with. That can be swept under the rug easily.

&gt;Can you give me an example? Because I honestly don't know what you're referring to.

I have been doing that all along. How could you possibly have missed it? Go back and look how many times I had to correct your misleading abuse of evidences and prevent you from going off into red herrings, etc. 

Here is just one more example, from your latest exchange:

&gt;OK, take the Book of Mormon then. Or Dianetics. The authors of those books held them out as true, and there are a lot of people who believe them to be true. Is that compelling evidence that they are in fact true? I think we would agree that it is not.

If you go back, you'll find that my statement was not merely that""the authors of the bible believed it was true."" It was more than that, but you created a strawman by implying that was my argument. The authors of the bible did not just believe it; they died under torturous conditions rather than renounce the truth of their **own eyewitness testimony**. No other religion can boast anything like that.

If you wanted honest discussion, you would have dealt directly with the force of that fact, instead of creating a strawman and then using red herrings (Book of Mormon, Dianetics, etc.) to draw the conversation off track.

To accuse creationists that belief in God is necessary to believe in creationism is stating the obvious.  How can you have creationism without a Creator? 

It is equally incumbent on atheists to believe in atheistic naturalism,  and not creationism.

The physical evidence overwhelmingly supports the theory of sudden creation, and conflicts with common ancestry.  That the 'tactics' used by common ancestry promoters includes censorship, ridicule, personal attacks, and every fallacy in the book only supports that observation.

What basis do you have for trusting it now?  How can you be certain that God is not a trickster?

&gt; the principle of uniformity in nature: that the future will be like the present, therefore predictable.

This ""principle of uniformity"" is wrong.  The future will not be like the present, just as the present is not like the past.  There used to be dinosaurs.  Now there aren't.

Even the uniformity of the laws of physics over time is not a given, it's an observed (and remarkable) fact about the universe.  But it didn't have to be that way.

&gt; I was referring also to the fragments, not just a complete codex.

If you're going to argue that *the Bible* hasn't changed then you can only go back as far as the earliest complete manuscript.  Before that you can't even demonstrate that the Bible even *existed*, let alone that it is unchanged.  The Bible is an anthology.  Some parts of it existed before it was completely assembled, but the whole thing only came into existence when it was first completely assembled.

&gt; No, but now you're moving the goalposts on this point. You asked how we could know if the Muslim claim that the Bible has been corrupted is true, and I answered that. There is no evidence that the Bible has been substantially corrupted

You keep switching back and forth between foundational assumptions.  Muslims do not argue for the corruption of the Bible on *evidence*, they argue for it as a direct logical consequence of *their* foundational assumption that the Quran is the final Word of God.  You can't argue against foundational assumptions on evidence (as shown by the fact that no evidence can persuade you that the Bible is not the Word of God) or even on logic.  Foundational assumptions are true *by definition*.

On the *evidence*, neither the Bible nor the Quran is the Word of God.  If this were not true, one could argue for the truth of one or the other on the evidence, but no one does this, not even you.  You take the Bible as your foundational assumption.  You have no other choice because the truth of the Bible cannot be defended on the evidence.

&gt; I don't know how many of the heretical texts are completely lost, but again this is a red herring.

No, it isn't.  If you're going to take as your foundational assumption that scripture is true, then it is absolutely crucial to know what writings are scripture and what are not.  If the writings are lost, then there is no way to go back and check to make sure that the people who deemed them heretical got it right.  Maybe some writings that were deemed heretical were actually scripture.  If those writings are lost, how could we possibly know?

&gt; having mysterious elements does not equal any logical contradiction.

Yes, that's true.  But logic is never mysterious.  So if something is *essentially* mysterious (as opposed to just being apparently mysterious because we haven't fully understood it yet) it is necessarily illogical.  My understanding is that the Trinity is essentially mysterious.

&gt; [Psalm22] is a prophetic lament

It doesn't read that way to me.  Look at verse 2:

""O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not""

How could Jesus possibly ""cry in the daytime"" and God not hear?

But maybe we should just agree to disagree about this one.

&gt; Evidence could never be a foundational assumption (an axiom). Evidence must be interpreted from within a worldview.

Right.  The foundational assumption of science is that the simplest explanation that accounts for all the evidence is the truth.

&gt; This misses the point. The point I made was that even the author of Harry Potter herself does not believe her writings to be true. Yet the authors of the bible proved their belief was genuine by dying for it.

OK, take the Book of Mormon then.  Or Dianetics.  The authors of those books held them out as true, and there are a lot of people who believe them to be true.  Is that compelling evidence that they are in fact true?  I think we would agree that it is not.

&gt; The people praying for him believed, and it was their faith that apparently mattered in that situation, not the man's who was healed.

Sure.  But the point is that this event was *directly witnessed* by an atheist.

So why can't some Christian do a similar demonstration for me that I can witness with my own eyes?  In fact, why isn't this happening all the time all over the world?  Why are all these extraordinary events being documented only on this one YouTube channel?

&gt; You cannot explain the man's healing by the placebo effect. If he was healed, it had to be a real healing because he clearly didn't believe it would work until it apparently did.

No, that's one of the remarkable things about the placebo effect: you don't have to actually believe in it in order for it to work.  It's enough to think that it *might* work.

http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/just-sugar-pill-placebo-effect-real/

&gt;  I don't really see that you are ""seeking"". Instead you are twisting the Bible and using every trick in the book to avoid the conclusion that the Bible is true.

Conclusion???  I thought you said that the truth of the scripture was your foundational *assumption*.  Which is it?

Billions of years ago, there was this giant mass of everything that nobody knows how it got there or if it always existed before that.

Somehow it threw out all of these round-ish shapes all with different material in them of differing sizes and some of them somehow had just the right makeup and size to create nuclear fusion and become stars.  At least one of them somehow had water on them.  The expansion from the Big Bang somehow slowed dramatically nearly immediately afterward somehow completely defying known science.  All of this just happened by chance to form the universe as we know it and give Earth the exact distance it needed to be from the Sun and Moon to provide conditions that could somehow form life out of death against all known science from some sort of chemical soup.

If he rejects this evidence and Humphreys’ model, then just remind him that creationists have already discovered at least *four possible solutions* to this problem. Just so you know, these are the solutions: [Humphreys’ first cosmology](https://www.amazon.com/Starlight-Time-Russell-Humphreys-Ph-D/dp/0890512027), [the Carmeli cosmology](https://usstore.creation.com/starlight-time-and-the-new-physics-second-edition?utm_source=creation.com&amp;utm_medium=article-sidebar-desktop&amp;utm_campaign=helpful_resources&amp;utm_term=Starlight%2C+Time+and+the+New+Physics%2C+second+edition%3B+updated&amp;utm_content=article%3AStarlight+and+time—a+further+breakthrough), [the Anisotropic Synchrony Convention](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/starlight/anisotropic-synchrony-convention-distant-starlight-problem/), and [Humphreys’ second cosmology](https://www.icr.org/article/new-creationist-cosmology-no-time-at/) (this is the one I already showed you).

Sadly, most anti-YEC types deny or disregard these models.

Ah the hypocrisy!!!!

But in general, don't debate the distant starlight issue is with an evolutionist, YECs don't have a good case yet.  Admit YECs don't have a good case yet, but point out cosmology is in crisis for the reasons I just stated.  Point out, the Big Bang looked on solid ground for decades, but now it's coming apart and it needs the rescue mechanisms described above. So all you can do is offer a promissory note for now.

Not all YECs accept ASC or the other 11 other YEC cosmologies out there.

You stepped right into a trap by debating YEC/YCC issues instead of debating Design, Creation, and Flood issues.  Those issues strictly speaking don't require YEC/YCC

&gt;I'm eager for this debate

I'm glad you're eager, but as a researcher into these topics, I think the Creationists don't serve their case well by pretending we have a good case in the areas your opponent is specializing in.  I know this because at ICC 2018, it was obvious that no one has come up with a satisfactory explanation to distant starlight.

I spoke with a mathematical PhD level physicist recently who is a YEC, and I have an MS in Physics from Johns Hopkins, and I wouldn't accept such a debate.  I studied cosmology, astrophysics, and general relativity.  These are much harder topics to debate than issues about abiogenesis, evolution, and the age of the fossil record.

It says in Proverbs 25:2:

&gt;It's the glory of God to conceal a matter, the glory of kings is to search out a matter.

God has hidden away for thousands of years a lot of the mysteries that would confirm a literal reading of Genesis, but not all the mysteries.  Distant starlight is the big one.

I don't know why YEC/YCCs have to be so insistent on a young universe!  I tell people I accept YEC/YCC, but don't have a good case for distant starlight and a weak case on long term radiometric dates, but I accept YEC/YCC because so much else in the literal interpretation of Genesis (like genetic entropy, special creation, the great flood) accords with the facts available to us.  The case for Noah's flood, for special creation, for the recency of creation -- they don't formally require the universe to be young.

I would not serve you well if I told you the YEC/YCC have a good empirical and theoretical case for a solution to distant starlight.  They absolutely do not relative to other YEC/YCC theories like Intelligent Design, special creation (vs. abiogenesis), genetic entropy vs. human evolution, special creation vs. Eukaryotic evolution, and orphan gene evolution, a global flood vs. long ages of fossils.

In Genesis it clearly says God created, day one, light and then divided it from the darness. no source for light was created. the sun/stars were created later on creation week. instantly starlight was seen just like now. I suggest the sugggestion that light does not move from here to there but light is everywhete always. So what moves is instead a explosion of force, like a pebble in a pond where the energy moves but not the water. Same equation. So starlight is not a telling about time. there is no evidence that starlight speed exists or that it shows a old earth. they are convincing themselves too quick. 

We can assume in a more perfect original creation that light was instant to eyes from stars. Its rates now are just a special case. By the way some of them have speculated light speed was different back then.

t1_fcvtx80,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;This is one of the things that distinguishes things with minds than things without them: minds are complicated, and so the behavior of things with minds is generally much more difficult to predict than things without minds.

Even if I grant that, we are talking about the universe, not the mind of God. The universe is God's creation, so even if the rules that govern it may be simple (I'm not saying they are), that would not tell us that the mind of God is simple. If you look at biology, you will see how very non-simple God's mind can be.

&gt;If you believed that the truth of scripture could be reliable ascertained from the evidence, it seems to me that you should take evidence as your foundational assumption as I do, and reason from there to the truth of scripture.

No, because if I did that I would have no basis for trusting my own reasoning in the first place. Only from within the Christian worldview can we trust our reason as human beings and trust the principle of uniformity in nature: that the future will be like the present, therefore predictable.

&gt;The oldest complete Bible is the Aleppo codex which dates to 930.

I was referring also to the fragments, not just a complete codex.

&gt; The provenance of the second half of Mark 16 is highly suspect. 

To my knowledge, it is only the ""long ending"" of Mark that is genuinely under suspicion of being a later addition. Not the entire second half of the book.

&gt;So? Just because a text has been faithfully copied doesn't mean that it is *true*. The Illiad has also been faithfully copied, but that doesn't mean that it's true.

No, but now you're moving the goalposts on this point. You asked how we could know if the Muslim claim that the Bible has been corrupted is true, and I answered that. There is no evidence that the Bible has been substantially  corrupted, but there is evidence that the Koran has been corrupted, and for that matter it is internally incoherent and contradicts the Bible, while at the same time claiming that the Bible comes from God.

&gt;The same is true of Christian writings. The early Christian church ordered the destruction of heretical texts, many of which are now completely lost.

I don't know how many of the heretical texts are completely lost, but again this is a red herring. The muslims claim that the Bible (not other heretical texts) has been corrupted. We can test that claim using lower criticism. We cannot test the Koran using lower criticism any further back than Uthmann.

&gt;If so, can these three persons have disagreements? If not, then in what sense are they three persons?

No way could they have disagreements, but I cannot claim to fully understand the Godhead; having mysterious elements does not equal any logical contradiction.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Psalm22 doesn't sound like a prophecy to me (at least not before verse 25). It sounds like a lament.

It is a prophetic lament that exactly matches the circumstances of Jesus' death, allowing for the use of poetic language.

&gt;This is the difference between religion and science. The truths of religions are only discernible by those who believe, but scientific truths are discernible whether or not you believe in them. This is one of the reasons I choose evidence as my foundational assumption.

Evidence could never be a foundational assumption (an axiom). Evidence must be interpreted from within  a worldview. Your foundational assumption might be something like ""the laws of logic hold"", or ""nature is uniform"", etc. But in order to do science you'll have to blindly assert a whole host of axioms you cannot prove, if you refuse to start with Scripture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Personally I believe that the truth is independent of people's beliefs, so whether or not people believe in something carries very little weight with me.

This misses the point. The point I made was that even the author of Harry Potter herself does not believe her writings to be true. Yet the authors of the bible proved their belief was genuine by dying for it.

**"" For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. "" 2 Peter 1:16**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, I did. That video actually contradicts what you just told me. The person who was healed *didn't believe* until *after* he was healed.

The people praying for him believed, and it was their faith that apparently mattered in that situation, not the man's who was healed.

&gt;BTW, I absolutely believe that *belief* in God can have very powerful positive impacts on people's lives, even to the point of healing (via the placebo effect, which is a real, scientifically verifiable phenomenon).

You cannot explain the man's healing by the placebo effect. If he was healed, it had to be a real healing because he clearly didn't believe it would work until it apparently did.

&gt;I'm trying to help you change my mind, because if you're right and I'm wrong I really want to know.

If this is really a true statement, then you **will** know. God promised that much: seek and you will find. But I don't really see that you are ""seeking"". Instead you are twisting the Bible and using every trick in the book to avoid the conclusion that the Bible is true. That looks more like somebody who is running away from God, than it looks like somebody who is genuinely seeking. I pray you will seek genuinely and humbly before God.",1578012878

t1_fcve2ut,lisper,"&gt; Predictable and simple are two very different concepts

That's true, but they are not entirely unrelated.  One of the reasons that science is able to make reliable predictions is *because* the laws that govern the behavior of the universe turn out to be simple.  When things get too complicated, prediction becomes impossible.  This is one of the things that distinguishes things with minds than things without them: minds are complicated, and so the behavior of things with minds is generally much more difficult to predict than things without minds.

&gt; &gt;  How am I supposed to tell which one is wrong?

&gt; You look at the evidence.

That seems like a very odd position for you to take.  If you believed that the truth of scripture could be reliable ascertained from the evidence, it seems to me that you should take evidence as your foundational assumption as I do, and reason from there to the truth of scripture.  But you don't.  You take the truth of scripture as your foundational assumption.  That, to me, is evidence that you don't actually believe that the truth of scripture can be persuasively argued on the evidence.

On the evidence, both Christianity and Islam appear false to me.

But whatever, let's take a look at some of your evidence:

&gt; We have manuscripts of the Bible that date back further than the entire religion of Islam

That's not true.  The oldest complete Bible is the Aleppo codex which dates to 930.  Islam dates back to 600.  There are earlier fragments, but even the very earliest only goes back to 100 years after Jesus died.  In any case, earlier does not necessarily imply truer.  The Illiad pre-dates both Christianity and Islam.  That doesn't mean it's true.

&gt; and they confirm that the Bible has remained almost completely unchanged since its original revelation;

So?  Just because a text has been faithfully copied doesn't mean that it is *true*.  The Illiad has also been faithfully copied, but that doesn't mean that it's true.

&gt; the main 'corruption' we find in the various manuscripts are various minor spelling mistakes that can easily be cross-referenced through the process of lower criticism in order to arrive at the original autograph with a very high degree of certainty.

That's not true.  The provenance of the second half of Mark 16 is highly suspect.

&gt; On the other hand, the Koran cannot be subjected to such analysis because Uthmann ordered all copies burned except his version, wiping the historical slate clean.

The same is true of Christian writings.  The early Christian church ordered the destruction of heretical texts, many of which are now completely lost.

&gt; Three Persons, one God.

That makes no sense to me, but OK, I'll bite: what makes them three persons?  Do these three persons have three different minds?  If so, can these three persons have disagreements?  If not, then in what sense are they three persons?

&gt; While Jesus was dead, he was separated from his physical body just as all of us are when we die.

Fair enough.  I'll concede that point.

&gt; One major reason he said it was to fulfill the prophecy of Psalm 22

Psalm22 doesn't sound like a prophecy to me (at least not before verse 25).  It sounds like a lament.

&gt; Jesus' feeling of isolation because he took upon the weight of sin for the world, and the Father had to punish him for that sin which was not even his own.

Yeah, that never made any sense to me either.

&gt; It seems to me that you have not understood the Trinity

That's probably true.

&gt; nor have you diligently studied the Scriptures

That's not true.  I know the Bible better than most Christians I've encountered.

Did I mention that I actually run a Bible study group?

&gt; And I would say there most certainly is an observable difference, but not for those who suppress the truth. God has engineered it exactly as he intended to. His presence is just clear enough to be detectable for those who choose to have faith, and yet subtle enough to be ignored by those who choose to ignore it.

This is the difference between religion and science.  The truths of religions are only discernible by those who believe, but scientific truths are discernible whether or not you believe in them.  This is one of the reasons I choose evidence as my foundational assumption.

&gt; Does anybody really believe Harry Potter is real?

I don't know, probably not.  But people do believe all kinds of other crazy shit.  Some people believe that the earth is flat.  Some people believe that Joseph Smith received a revelation from God.  Some people believe that L. Ron Hubbard is some sort of demi-god.  Some people believe that quantum mechanics will let you conjure up gold rings out of thin air (look up ""Ramtha's School of Enlightenment"").

Personally I believe that the truth is independent of people's beliefs, so whether or not people believe in something carries very little weight with me.

&gt; I actually watched the video, did you?

Yes, I did.  That video actually contradicts what you just told me.  The person who was healed *didn't believe* until *after* he was healed.

&gt; It seemed pretty legitimate from what I could tell.

Yes, it seemed legitimate to me too.  But just because something seems legitimate doesn't mean that it is.

Here's an even better one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8ynID2ep2Y

Apparently, they can do this on a regular basis.  They even demonstrate it for atheists:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kXYNz_d4ck

BTW, I absolutely believe that *belief* in God can have very powerful positive impacts on people's lives, even to the point of healing (via the placebo effect, which is a real, scientifically verifiable phenomenon).

&gt; Stop throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.

I'm a guest here on /r/Creation so that would be inappropriate.  I'm trying to help you change my mind, because if you're right and I'm wrong I really want to know.  I believe the best way I can do that is to explain to you why I believe what I do so that you can focus your argument.

I couldn't find any other references for the Vollosovitch mammoth, so unless you do have a source I'm going to dismiss that one as spurious.

The dating of the Dima/Kirgilyakh mammoth is discussed [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116301664). I'll summarise briefly:

Five radiometric dates agreed on a date of ca. 44,000 BP, which is confirmed by the pollen in Dima's hair and the plant material in its digestive tract. This is almost certainly the correct date.

The younger date (26,000) was returned by an early experimental application of AMS and is additionally described as suspect due to the ""lack of any method descriptions and of any appropriate background evaluations"". Although this is a true discordance, it is of very low quality.

The mismatch with the wood in the same stratum is caused by the soluflection (downhill flow with the soil) of the carcass. This was confirmed by the discovery of clusters of mammoth hair matching Dina's upslope from the carcass and by the rate at which the soluflection occurred.

That was fun. Any more?",1578001656

Predictable and simple are two very different concepts, so I have no idea where you're getting this from.  


&gt; Let me make this very simple: Christians tell me the Bible is true. Muslims tell me it has been corrupted. They can't both be right. How am I supposed to tell which one is wrong? 

You look at the evidence. We have manuscripts of the Bible that date back further than the entire religion of Islam, and they confirm that the Bible has remained almost completely unchanged since its original revelation; the main 'corruption' we find in the various manuscripts are various minor spelling mistakes that can easily be cross-referenced through the process of lower criticism in order to arrive at the original autograph with a very high degree of certainty. On the other hand, the Koran cannot be subjected to such analysis because Uthmann ordered all copies burned except his version, wiping the historical slate clean.   


&gt; It seems illogical *to me*. Three does not equal one. 

Three Persons, one God. The three and one are not three and one in the same sense. If they were, that would be a contradiction.   


&gt;  While he was dead, were the Father and the Holy Spirit also dead? Is ""alive"" and ""dead"" even a concept that applies to the Father and HS? If not, how can it apply to the Son? 

Very easy. The Son was incarnated, while the Father and the Spirit were not. The proper definition of ""death"" in biblical terms is ""separation"". Physical death is separation from the body, while spiritual death is separation from God. While Jesus was dead, he was separated from his physical body just as all of us are when we die.  


&gt; What was the status of the Trinity before Jesus was born? 

The same as it ever was and ever will be. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God and the word was God.  


&gt; Also, if the Son and the Father are ""one in essence, nature, power, action, and will"", why would the Son inquire of the Father, ""Why have you forsaken me?"" (Mark15:34) 

One major reason he said it was to fulfill the prophecy of Psalm 22, and to allude directly to this passage for those who have ""ears to hear"" so they would also know that it has been fulfilled in him at that moment.  


It is also the human expression of Jesus' feeling of isolation because he took upon the weight of sin for the world, and the Father had to punish him for that sin which was not even his own.  


&gt; We're not going to reach agreement about that. I just want you to understand why the trinity seems illogical *to me*.   


It seems to me that you have not understood the Trinity nor have you diligently studied the Scriptures to be able to know the answers to these questions you have been asking. That is why it ""seems"" illogical to you. You claim to study the Bible, but the answers to these questions are already found there.  


&gt; All I'm asking for is some observable *difference* between believing in a true God and believing in a false one. 

And I would say there most certainly is an observable difference, but not for those who suppress the truth. God has engineered it exactly as he intended to.  His presence is just clear enough to be detectable for those who choose to have faith, and yet subtle enough to be ignored by those who choose to ignore it. This is God's way. I probably wouldn't do it that way myself, but thankfully I am not God.  


&gt; So I am given to understand. But here's the problem with that: the only accounts of Jesus's miracles are in the Bible, and I have not yet accepted the Bible as truth. Harry Potter is also reputed to have performed miracles/magic. I've even seen video of him doing it. Am I supposed to believe that too? 

Does anybody really believe Harry Potter is real? You can go ask the author herself if she believes it. She will tell you no. However the authors of the Bible did really believe their message, enough so that they were willing to die for their testimony under torture, rather than to say that it was all a lie. That is a huge difference.  


&gt; So how am I supposed to tell whether the video you pointed me to is a real healing or a fake one? 

That's not really my problem, it's yours. You were the one asking for observable evidence (miracles). I have given it to you, but you still reject it apparently. That's the ironic thing about miracles: it still takes faith to believe they are miracles from God. Even the pharisees of Jesus' day witnessed some of his miracles and chose to attribute them to Satan rather than to God. Just because you witness a miracle doesn't force you to believe God. You can always decide to believe you were hallucinating, or you just don't know what you saw, etc.  


I actually watched the video, did you? It seemed pretty legitimate from what I could tell.

I can't think of a more likely way for things to get stuck in stone and fossilize.   It's possible that a single global flood caused all the fossils, but it's unlikely because many places do reveal layers of different kinds of animals in different layers, suggesting that these sediments were formed over the years (although there is some mixing, it is generally separate layer with one kind of animal near the top, another near he bottom and perhaps some mixing here and there.

I think there's lots of good useful and valuable science that isn't observable or  testable.  This has been widely acknowledged in the philosophy of science if not by scientists 

 In ,fact I think most scientific propositions like Newton Einstein etc aren't really testable or observable, we can't know that nothing is faster than the speed of light or that light is a cosmic speed limit, we can observe the speed of light, but we can't observe cosmic speed limits, similarly we can't observe the fabric of space time, we can't directly observe inertia because we can't observe motion in an actual vacuum for infinity, we can't observe or test or a lot of physical properties.

Let me give you some examples of why the trinity seems illogical to me: after Jesus was crucified, he was dead for three days, right?  While he was dead, were the Father and the Holy Spirit also dead?  Is ""alive"" and ""dead"" even a concept that applies to the Father and HS?  If not, how can it apply to the Son?  Did the Trinity cease to exist while the Son was dead?  What was the status of the Trinity before Jesus was born?

Also, if the Son and the Father are ""one in essence, nature, power, action, and will"", why would the Son inquire of the Father, ""Why have you forsaken me?"" (Mark15:34)

Feel free to treat those as rhetorical questions.  We're not going to reach agreement about that.  I just want you to understand why the trinity seems illogical *to me*.

&gt; John 1:1 uses the Greek term 'Logos' for God, which can be translated ""word"" but is also the source of our English word 'logic'.

Sure, but it is a serious mistake to confuse etymology with semantics.  Also, just because something proclaims itself to be logical doesn't mean that it is.

&gt; The Bible confirms that there are supernatural spirits at work

Sure.  And you have taken the truth of the Bible as your foundational assumption, so this is a convincing argument for you.  But I have not accepted the truth of the Bible (yet) so this is not (yet) a convincing argument for me.

&gt; So you want to see some miraculous signs

No, it doesn't have to be miraculous.  All I'm asking for is some observable *difference* between believing in a true God and believing in a false one.

If you can't provide that, I don't see how you can possibly distinguish, even in principle, between a true and a false god.

Nothing is certain except death and the taxes. But let's run over what they actually did.

* Many thousands of trees were used in building this chronology. The first part of the abstract describes how they added many new trees to the inventory. The more trees, the higher the confidence.

* They then describe how they removed oaks affected by cockchafer, which can make it harder to read the ring patterns. This mainly affected trees in particular regions of Central Europe. This further increases the quality of the chronology.

* And then they lengthened through time the chronology by linking earlier ""floating"" sequences to the main chronology.

I also wanted to see the responses you got from this sub. Unfortunately, I don't think you got proper responses to answer your question or in the manner that they responded to you.

Your question and data provided are a little outside of my novice and layman understanding but I want to try to answer it the best I can.

I think the best answer is going to come from the following video. It's less than an hour long and presents the information in a very fair and balanced way. I implor you to watch it. At least through the parts about 1/2 in that go into a little bit of detail about Einsteinian laws, time-dilation and the stretching of the Universe during creation.

[Scientific Evidences for a Young Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_9c0-hbmIA&amp;list=PL3W5IGDayLeLuQDWFVi0TKtJgzHz2pF0n&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s)


In short though, during the creation of the Universe (less than 10,000 years ago), God ""Stretched out the Heavens"". This terminology is used multiple times in the Bible to talk about how God created the Universe (the Heavens). I believe it is used 17 times, but I may be wrong on the exact number.

During this stretching of the heavens (for reasons explained in the video) massive time dilation would have occurred cause time to advance at a much-ecelerated rate.

Please watch the video and let me know your thoughts. If you'd like, I'd be happy to discuss this further with you.

Contamination is excluded as a possibility when you have a large number of samples from different locations which agree, as in the chart I linked. It is also increasingly unlikely for individual analyses when the analysis is done competently and absent known sources of contamination.

t1_fct6kvi,stcordova,"&gt;Great post! I think I found the paper you referred to:

&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906570/

Yes indeed, and there is even more that was never officially recognized by the scientific establishment by Dr. Sanford. Thankfully, some evolutionary biologists/geneticists, in honest moments have already said what Dr. Sanford could not say.  Part of my job is finding those papers that have been swept under the rug.

&gt;Which is a fascinating read.

If you find that fascinating, you have a very special kind of mind!   I personally like structural biology since it is CANDY for the eyes.

&gt;is kimuras neutral theory essentially just expansion on fishers corollary?

Actually no.  Kimura realized natural selection can't actually work for most of molecular evolution, which (though he wouldn't concede it), meant Darwinism couldn't explain most of the complexity of biology for genomes as complex as humans.  This was actually inspired by works by JBS Haldane, who ironically said what Dr. Sanford re-discovered after Dr. Sanford became a Christian at age 39.

Haldane wrote:
&gt;Secondly, natural selection can only act on the variations available, and these are not, as Darwin thought, in every direction. In the first place, **most mutations lead to a loss of complexity** (e.g. substitution of leaves for tendrils in the pea and sweet pea) or reduction in the size of some organ {e.g. wings in Drosophila). This is probably the reason for the at first sight paradoxical fact that, as we shall see later, **most evolutionary change has been degenerative.**  -- JBS Haldane, Causes of Evolution, page 139

But, specifically Haldane wrote this paper which inspired Kimura:

http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/slatkin/popgenjclub/pdf/haldane1957.pdf

Haldane realized that Natural Selection comes at a price, there is a ""Cost of Natural Selection"", and if the cost is too great Natural Selection can't be the explanation for most of evolution.  Kimura built upon this.

Haldane observed:
&gt;I shall try to make the quantitiative **the fairly obvious statement** that natural selection cannot occur with great intensity for a number of characters at once unless they are controlled by the same gene.

Well it's not fairly obvious to Ultra Darwinists like Richard Dawkins!

Example.  Consider we have a small population, and one individual has an trait that makes him fast, and another individual with a trait that makes him smart and also self-sacrificing.  While the two are walking together in the forest, a lion comes along, and the fast (selfish) guy gets away and the smart self-sacrificing guy gets devoured by the lion.

Sooo, that shows that natural selection can't favor all favorable traits in a population.  So much for Darwin's false claim that:

&gt;natural selection, is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good   -- CHarles Darwin

BALONEY!  For the reasons stated.  Kimura merely formalized the problem and showed the absurdity of Darwin's claim that it is possible even in principle to add up all the good.  In fact, Kimura show a lot of good will get eliminated by random chance!  Patrick Moran also showed this independently with other methods.",1577937799

Tribal behavior for one, and then trying to settle scores once you've embarrassed them and their friends.

Finally, lots of Darwinists are just plain evil and are raging against the Creator, just like the Pharisees after seeing Jesus work miracles.

Jesus told us we can be expected to be hated for following him.  It's not just hatred of creationists, but especially Christian creationists.

Oddly, creationism is less a reason to hate Christians these days compared to Christians saying, ""a dude can't get pregnant.""  They'll hate us for creationism, and it used to be that it was for the cause of science.  That was just an flimsy excuse, a facade. They found other things to hate us for.

t1_fcsyv0z,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;For example, we may have just different ideas of what the word ""simple"" means.

I don't remember using the term 'simple'.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; How do you get from the Bible to ""predictable patterns""? 

Well, lots of different ways. For one thing, God holds all things together that he has created:

"" \[Jesus\] is the image of the invisible God, the first-born \[prototokos\] of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities \[these words in Greek refer to the hierarchical angelic powers\]-all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and **in him all things hold together**."" **Colossians 1:15-17** 

We also know that God's nature is unchanging. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Because if you can show me someone who can make more reliable predictions using the Bible than science is capable of, that would rock my world. 

This is a false dichotomy. Science is a tool and a method, whereas the Bible is propositional revelation. They are two totally different things, so for you to pit them against one another is, again, nonsensical. As I have already pointed out, it was adherents of the Bible and the Christian worldview that started the endeavor of modern science to begin with. Based upon their Christian worldview they expected to be able to do science, and they were indeed able to.  


&gt; Also news to me. How do you know this? AFAICT the word ""logical"" does not appear in the Bible. And there are some parts of Christian theology that seem inherently illogical to me, like the doctrine of the trinity. 

There is nothing illogical at all about the Trinity, but logic is part and parcel of wisdom (one cannot be wise without also being logical). In addition, God says:  


 **“Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord:**  
**though your sins are like scarlet,**  
 **they shall be as white as snow;**  
**though they are red like crimson,**  
 **they shall become like wool. ""**

And John 1:1 uses the Greek term 'Logos' for God, which can be translated ""word"" but is also the source of our English word 'logic'.   


&gt; (How do you know that it's God talking?) 

Romans 8:16- "" The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God ""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"" To convince me of the existence of the the Christian God (or any god) all it would take is a demonstration of some observable effect that could be produced by belief in (or appeal to) that god that could not be produced by by belief in or appeal to some other god. ""

The Bible confirms that there are supernatural spirits at work in this world that are deceivers and are working against God, and that these spirits masquerade as gods and are worshiped by people. So with that said, even if you were to find miraculous signs being done by somebody worshiping a false god, that would not invalidate the Christian worldview.  


&gt;  I'll settle for pretty much anything as long as it's measurable.  But some suggestions are to be found in Mark 16:17-18. 

So you want to see some miraculous signs, then. Scripture never promises that God will provide miraculous signs to scoffers who are suppressing the truth! In fact, this is what Jesus specifically says about such a demand coming from a scoffer:  


""  *A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” Jesus then left them and went away.* "" (From Matt. 16)  


Keep in mind, Jesus did do miracles, but when the Pharisees (scoffers) demanded it of him, he refused, because they were already wickedly suppressing what truth they had. Given this fact, I would not expect the Christian God to bow down to your demand. If he did, it would be puzzling to me.  


However, this is the modern age, so we have video cameras. Here is a video of somebody being miraculously healed, so by your own standard I would expect you to become a believer after watching this:

t1_fcsobks,lisper,"&gt; That is a nonsensical statement, because in the Christian worldview we expect to find that the world is governed in its regular operation by predictable patterns (what we call 'laws').

Why would that make my statement non-sensical?  To the contrary, it would seem to indicate instead that our respective world views are not as different as you imagine.  Maybe we're just getting hung up on terminology.  For example, we may have just different ideas of what the word ""simple"" means.  Once again you appear to be seeking to create conflict where there is none.

&gt; because in the Christian worldview we expect to find that the world is governed in its regular operation by predictable patterns

Really?  That's news to me.  I thought you said that your foundational assumption was the truth of scripture (by which I assume you mean the Bible).  How do you get from the Bible to ""predictable patterns""?  Do these ""predictable patterns"" actually allow you to make predictions?  Because if you can show me someone who can make more reliable predictions using the Bible than science is capable of, that would rock my world.

&gt; God is logical

Also news to me.  How do you know this?  AFAICT the word ""logical"" does not appear in the Bible.  And there are some parts of Christian theology that seem inherently illogical to me, like the doctrine of the trinity.

&gt; God is logical, and God upholds the universe by his power according to his will. It is in fact the atheist worldview that has a problem accounting for laws, because with atheism there is neither a law-giver nor a law-enforcer.

This is a perfect example of what I alluded to above.  Simple things can't have wills.  Wills are properties of minds, and minds are complex things.

It is also important to realize that atheism is not a world view.  *Science* is a world view.  Atheism is a consequence of science.  It *turns out* that the behavior of nature can be described in terms of simple laws with no need to appeal to complex agents or deities.  It didn't have to turn out that way.  That's just where the data leads.  Nature is both the giver and the enforcer of the fundamental laws from which the observable behavior of the universe emerges.  It is a remarkable fact that simple laws can give rise to all the complexity we see.  But it does, on the evidence, appear to be a fact.

&gt; God does speak to me in subtle ways, but not overtly and audibly

I don't require God's communication to be overt and audible.  But I do have to have *some* way to know that it's God talking and that I'm not just talking to myself or suffering from schizophrenia.

(How do you know that it's God talking?)

&gt; what evidence would you reasonably expect to find of the Christian God in particular, that you do not find

This is a slightly different question than ""The Big Question"" of ""YEC, the existence of God, the authority of scripture"".  I could be convinced of the divinity of Jesus independently of the authority of scripture.

To convince me of the existence of the the Christian God (or any god) all it would take is a demonstration of some observable effect that could be produced by belief in (or appeal to) that god that could not be produced by by belief in or appeal to some other god.  I'm not too particular about what that effect should be.  I'll settle for pretty much anything as long as it's measurable.  But some suggestions are to be found in Mark 16:17-18.",1577928553

t1_fcrzlab,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;In general, any evidence that the world is not governed by simple laws would rock my worldview.

That is a nonsensical statement, because in the Christian worldview we expect to find that the world is governed in its regular operation by predictable patterns (what we call 'laws'). This flows from the fact that God exists, God is logical, and God upholds the universe by his power according to his will. It is in fact the atheist worldview that has a problem accounting for laws, because with atheism there is neither a law-giver nor a law-enforcer. The fact that you find a universe that behaves predictably lines up exactly with the Christian worldview and is not consistent with atheistic expectations. Modern science was birthed specifically in a Judeo-Christian cultural environment for exactly this reason.

&gt;So, for example, if I could have a sustained conversation with God (or the intelligent aliens that created us), that would (almost certainly) change my worldview. I mentioned this earlier and you rejected it because you thought I would write off the experience as a delusion. Well, no, I wouldn't, not if the conversation were *sustained*. If I could talk to God regularly I would become convinced of His existence in exactly the same way that I have become convinced of *your* existence, and in particular, that you are an actual human being and not, say, a chatbot.

I would also like to have this wonderful opportunity (God does speak to me in subtle ways, but not overtly and audibly)-- but the fact that God does not choose to operate in that way has no bearing at all on the question of his existence. In fact, if God did operate that way for everybody, it would contradict his Word and would count against the Christian worldview, not for it.

There are viral infections, for instance, which regularly and predictably follow the same sequence of mutations.

It doesn't matter if it kills the organism. That's just selection.

What matters is if something evolves in such a way that you can't ""spread your luck"" by selection. Stonehenge can't ""spread it's luck"" because it doesn't reproduce. Mutations that need to occur simultaneously can't ""spread their luck"" because there's no selective mechanism making mutations happen simultaneously.

t1_fcrp3we,lisper,"Ah, OK.

So in that light, let's take another look at the question you posed:

&gt; What kind of scientific evidence available to us would change your view?

So you didn't ask me what would change my view *in general*, you asked what *evidence* would change my view.  Moreover, that evidence has to be *scientific* and it has to be *available to us*.  You didn't specify whether you meant *currently* available or *potentially* available, and I don't know what you mean by ""scientific evidence"" and whether you think that there is such a thing as ""non-scientific evidence"" because I don't.  Evidence is evidence.  There is no distinction between ""scientific"" and ""non-scientific"" evidence.  (There is a distinction between *reprodicible* evidence and non-reproducible evidence, and I do lend more weight to reproducible evidence over non-reproducible evidence.  But it's all evidence.)  And if you really meant to restrict the evidence to *currently available* evidence, then the answer is (almost certainly) none of it will change my mind because I'm pretty familiar with the currently available evidence and it seems very unlikely that I'm unaware of something currently known that would change my mind.

But there is potentially available evidence that would change my mind.  In general, any evidence that the world is not governed by simple laws would rock my worldview.  As far as I can tell, all the phenomena of the world can ultimately be accounted for by very simple laws of physics, which give rise to chemistry, which gives rise to biology, which gives rise to brains, which gives rise to consciousness.  The ultimate emergent phenomena are very complex, but so far there is not a single one that has failed to yield to reductionism.  This is not to say that it couldn't happen -- the scientific endeavor is an on-going enterprise.  But I haven't seen it happen yet.

So, for example, if I could have a sustained conversation with God (or the intelligent aliens that created us), that would (almost certainly) change my worldview.  I mentioned this earlier and you rejected it because you thought I would write off the experience as a delusion.  Well, no, I wouldn't, not if the conversation were *sustained*.  If I could talk to God regularly I would become convinced of His existence in exactly the same way that I have become convinced of *your* existence, and in particular, that you are an actual human being and not, say, a chatbot.

You're right, if my only direct experience of God was transient, like the one Paul described -- a brief flash of light and a disembodied voice talking to me for less than a minute -- I would very likely ascribe that to some sort of hallucination.  But of course there is no way for me to know for certain until it actually happens to me -- maybe being in God's presence would be such a powerful experience that it would immediately change my mind.  Obviously I have no way to know that.  But an ongoing conversation would be a completely different kettle of fish.",1577909004

t3_eieh06,ronsmorynski,"This is the Way:

1. Focus on the Bible and what it says. It is the ONLY voice for Creation and the actual scientific evidence we find. When they tell you not to use it. So what! They have no foundation! No absolutes! Use it anyway. It has every Creation hypothesis, that leads to evidence based theories, and finally proven facts. From the Flood, to timeframe, to geology, to how life works, kinds, to super natural events, to our expanding universe, and on and on. Use it. God had it written for us.
2. The only Creation story, is the Bible. It is the only one that works and fits all the evidence we see. All other religions and their creation stories barely  made it from Babel, the  pagan evolution or an attempt to ride on the back of the Bible all the while tearing out as many other pages as they can. Only the Judeo-Christian religion stands firmly on God's Word.
3. Be fearless.
4. Stick to one claim. Do not believe an Atheists who says... ""Hi I'm atheist, I'm here to Help!"" ...Stop... nope, not here to help. You're here to deceive. Even unto thyself. Stick to one argument. Do not let the fool require the debate to go according to the fool's desire or ways. Instead, show the fool that their diatribe of rabbit holes is foolish and stick to the very first logical destroying argument, over and over... They will never concede... but you will realize that... and brush the dust off your sandals and move on. 
5. Do not allow those who speak in smarm, to get you to appreciate their 'help'. Deceivers first tactic... is deception. Do not allow them to flatter for the sake of gaining advantage. Just get to the point. Done. Move on. No need to play their foolish arrogant games and desire for self worth. Peace!

I have some thoughts/suggestions:

1. Focus on the science.  Facts, reasoning, evidence, not religious texts, dogmas, or beliefs.
2. Be ecumenical. There could be Muslims, Hindus, pantheists, or any who believe in a Crestor, not just biblical Christians. Creationism is not an exclusively 'Christian' theme.
3. Be fearless.  The bully pulpit of atheistic naturalism tries to intimidate, berate, and trivialize the Believers in creation. Religious bigotry like that should be exposed and resisted,  not submitted to meekly.  You owe it to the Creator, and all of humanity, to stand for this universal Truth.
4. Don't be sidetracked with diversions.  Religious arguments, beliefs, fallacies.
5. Ditch the Criticism Compulsion.  Some want the approval of the Common Ancestry Believers so badly, they look for ways to agree, which often takes form of nit picking another creationist's points.   *Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do*. ~Dale Carnegie

t1_fcncm7g,azusfan,"I agree that there has been, and still is, a ..reaction..  to the anti-science decrees among some religious movements.  New age hippies come to mind, with their mystical, ethereal views of the universe.  Many religious groups/movements have an almost knee jerk reaction toward anything 'science!'  

Much of that is due to the elitism and pretended expertise, that is rampant, among the status quo.

'Cigarettes are fine!  I'm a doctor and recommend Pall Mall!'

'Don't eat butter!  Its bad!'

'Don't eat margarine! Eat butter!'

'There is no God, humans descended from a single celled organism over millions of years!'

'Pesticides are good!'

'Automobiles are evil!  They are killing the planet!'

'The coastlines will be flooded by 1995!  (update) 2004!  (update) 2016!  (update) 2025!' from Global warming!, (update) Climate Change!'

It is no wonder that the less technical humans become skeptical toward the self proclaimed 'experts!' in the various scientific disciplines.   I attribute the PROBLEM, as being anti-science prognosticism, not the skepticism of laypersons.

IF.. the scientific community was more ..  scientific..  and less sensational, dogmatic, and hysterical, AND IF.. 'Science!' was presented as a system of discovery, instead of a club of submission, the common man might have more respect and less suspicion for the decrees of the elites.

But, since they are mostly agenda driven ideologues, and NOT objective, purely rational creatures, i do not expect that to happen. 

The illusion of the Mr. Spock-like 'scientist', who follows reason and the facts, and comes to only logical conclusions, is science fiction. 

Sure, it's easy to find unscientific minded reactionaries in religious institutions.  But i also find them pretending to be 'Experts!', and declaring their beliefs as 'settled science!', in institutions that are equally religious, at their core.

&gt; Only if we are spiritual beings could that be true. If we are made of matter only then we can only behave according to the laws of physics, just as all matter must.

Well, this gets into a deep philosophical issue.  I'm happy to get into those weeds with you if you really want to, but for the sake of this discussion I'll simply concede the point: yes, we are spiritual beings (whatever that might mean).  So if you choose to seek conflict with me, that's on you.  I seek truth and reconciliation (though I'll settle for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect).

&gt; All reasoning must have a starting axiom that cannot be proved. Mine is Scripture.

Cool.  That's it then.  My starting axiom is that experiment is the ultimate arbiter of truth.  We'll (almost certainly) just have to agree to disagree.  No *logical* argument is going to dissuade either of us.

Just out of curiosity, what exactly do you mean when you say, ""My starting axiom is scripture""?  I presume it means that your starting axiom is that everything written in the Bible is true.  Is that correct?  Because other creationists I have spoken with don't take scripture as an axiom, they *conclude* that scripture is true starting with some other axiom.  I just want to make sure I understand your position.

&gt; &gt; Cells were among the products of that evolutionary process, and so were not a ""chance occurrence.""

&gt; That's wrong.

No, it isn't.  Yes, randomness plays a role in evolution.  But no, the products of evolution are not ""chance occurrences"".  You are once again running afoul of my third admonition: do not confuse evolution and abiogenesis.  Abiogenesis is random.  Evolution is not.  That's why abiogensis happens only rarely while evolution is impossible to avoid once the process gets started.

&gt; &gt; Cells are absolutely not the beginning of the process.

&gt; According to science they are.

That's not true (though I'm still going to ask you for a reference because I'm interested to know where you got this idea).  But even if it were true, you're not having a discussion with ""science"", you're having a discussion with *me*, and *my* position is that cells are not the beginning of the process.  (That's actually the mainstream scientific position, but there's really no point in arguing about that.)

&gt; &gt; Not today. That primitive life form has gone extinct along with countless others.

&gt; Scientifically, you cannot say it has 'gone extinct' because there is no evidence it ever existed to begin with.

Of course I can say it.  It might not be true, but I can certainly say it.

But a thing does not have to leave direct evidence behind in order to infer its existence.  Jesus left no direct evidence of his existence either.  He never wrote anything.  He produced no artifacts.  The only reason we have to believe he existed is the testimony of (mostly anonymous) witnesses.  We can infer the existence of a precursor replicator molecule from indirect evidence in exactly the same way we infer the existence of Jesus.

&gt; &gt; I'm guessing that if God spoke to me, that would do it to.

&gt; I have a hard time believing that is true

Yes, I figured that would be the case (in case you haven't figured it out yet, this is not my first rodeo).  That is why I hedged with ""I'm guessing"".

But it doesn't matter.  It may well be that I don't know what evidence would change my mind.  But if God exists, then *He* knows.

&gt; During the middle 1800s, three awakenings broke out in the United States: the Second Great Awakening
(1800–1820), the revivals of Charles Finney (1824–1837), and the
Layman’s Prayer Revival (1856–1858). Much good came from these
movements. But their overall effect was to overemphasize immediate personal conversion to Christ instead of a studied period of reflection and conviction; emotional, simple, popular preaching instead of intellectually careful and doctrinally precise sermons; and personal feelings and relationship to Christ instead of a deep grasp of the nature of Christian teaching and ideas. Sadly, as historian George Marsden notes, “anti-intellectualism was a feature of American revivalism.”5


God indeed, as taught in 1 Cor 1, choose people that are the outcasts of society, and that includes those who may not appreciate science, or who may be anti-science.  The problem is, these people, as they rise in leadership in the church and save souls, assume that everything about their lives, including their lack of education in science, should be the norm for other Christians!

&gt; All reasoning has to start from some foundational assumption. Mine is that the universe behaves according to laws that can be deduced from the evidence. Yours is that the truth can only be obtained through divine revelation. 

You're on the right track. All reasoning must have a starting axiom that cannot be proved. Mine is Scripture. However that doesn't mean we cannot test worldviews against the evidence, because we all live in the same universe.  This video puts it very well I think:  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5hJRJfkUU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5hJRJfkUU0) 

The gist is, we can look at ourselves and the world around us and see if our starting assumptions (our worldview) comports well with our expediences, or if they are at odds. I find that by starting with Scripture, I can make sense of by far the most available information to me.  


Your starting assumption is baseless. Why would a universe with no governing authority (God) behave in a predictable way? What force or power exists to ensure that always remains true? It is the assumption of God, who exists timelessly and upholds the universe in predictable operation, that lead to the birthing of modern science.

I gave you a scientific source for my definition. Where are you getting yours from? Every scientific source I've ever seen has called cells the smallest unit of life.  


&gt; Hard to say. The kind of evidence that produces scientific revolutions is very hard to imagine before it appears.  

I didn't ask what would produce a scientific revolution. I asked what evidence you personally would expect to find of the Christian God, that you are failing to find currently.  


&gt;  I'm guessing that if God spoke to me, that would do it to. 

I have a hard time believing that is true, because given your worldview it would always be more probable that you were hallucinating, even if you didn't feel as if you were hallucinating. You might go see a psychiatrist or go on meds and try to forget the whole thing. Then you'd say ""if God were real, he'd appear to me again and again to prove it wasn't just a hallucination..."" etc. And then if God started appearing to you regularly you might conclude you needed to be checked into an asylum.  


But as we've already explored previously, the God of the Bible demands faith, and, absent some overriding reason, God is not going to reveal himself to people who choose to suppress the evidence he has already provided in what has been made.

As for your second point, consider the long lifespan of people before the Flood. I find it hard to believe that it could have been less than millions, but for obvious reasons we can’t know this for sure.

Men were definitely in high areas during the Flood, and these would have been the most eroded and most turbulent areas of the Flood, making it hard to fossilize many mammals and birds during the Flood [1](http://creationicc.org/2018_papers/32%20Clarey%20megasequences%20final.pdf).

t1_fck6unq,onecowstampede,"Sorry for the text wall,  I feel I need to clarify my position. 

""Taking about the Flood?""..
Only so much  as its relevant to the advent of deep time in geology,  which I beleive to be a  primary factor commonly read into the text.

The challenge levied against secular science is that one's world view has influence on the conclusion one draws from a given set of data.

Hermeneutics  are not immune  from the same criteria and we often fail to distinguish what we mean by interpretation of the text. 


The word exegesis literally means “to lead out of.”That means that the interpreter is led to his conclusions by following the text.
 ( sometimes only by the bible alone,  other times by pseudopigrahical  literature. Both are useful, but are limited to the text(s))

The word eisegesis literally means “to lead into,” which means the interpreter injects his own ideas into the text, making it mean whatever he wants.

By saying old earth is supported by exegesis is a huge leap of faith in the flexibility of Hebrew grammatical structures 

What I am proposing is that the claim: old earth/ framework view  as supported by exegesis is actually not.  At best it's a hybridized with eisegesis.  

So again I assert  that outside factors borne of the traditions of men,  (like the age of the earth according to geology) clearly influence the outcome of attempts to interpret the text. 

As seen here: 
https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm

*note* of the 28 biblical interpretations only 8  use an English phrase with an indefinite article in contrast to the 20 that do. 
As you stated ,in Hebrew there is no definite article
https://hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_Four/The_Definite_Article/the_definite_article.html
 So the very presence of a number is significant. It is there to specify order, not to poetically obfuscate the noun in effort to 

What's most noteworthy is that 2 of the 3 commentaries  explicitly state role of geologic time

Ellicots- 
""as St. Augustine pointed out, there was no sun then, and ""it is very difficult for us to imagine what sort of days these could be"" (De Civ. Dei, xi. 6, 7). It must further be observed that this knowledge of the stages of creation could only have been given by revelation, and that the agreement of the Mosaic record with geology is so striking that there is no real difficulty in believing it to be inspired. The difficulties arise almost entirely from popular fallacies or the mistaken views of commentators. Geology has done noble service for religion in sweeping away the mean views of God's method of working which used formerly to prevail.

Pulpit- 
""6. Geology declares that the earth must have been brought to its present condition through a series of labors extending over indefinitely long epochs""


FWIW  I Happened to come  across more about Augustine..  Again I do not assert either way what he held to as its not truly relevant,  but he has multiple interpretations contained in his works. 
""Thomas clearly believed, because he thought it was revealed in Scripture, that God created the world in six ordinary Earth days. So he distinguishes between God’s initial act of “creation,” his “distinction” of that creation (days one through three) and his “adornment” of creation (days four through seven) (I:65-74). Moreover, he thought that species have remained unchanged since their creation. Here he is following Aristotle, but he no doubt believed that this, too, was a straightforward reading of the biblical text.
He notes the different opinion of Augustine on the days of creation, who treated the days metaphorically rather than as actual, successive days. Augustine also thought God created things potentially rather than actually on these “days.” This made Augustine an outlier among the Church Fathers on these questions. Since Thomas revered Augustine, however, he seeks to give a charitable interpretation and to reconcile the great church father with the bulk of opinion on the other side–insofar as possible. But he doesn’t side with Augustine.""

t1_fcl0ilg,lisper,"&gt; the only possible explanation

I never said that was the only possible explanation.  What I said was that in order to produce the Hawaiian Islands in 6000 years by the mechanism that they appear to have been produced by, the Pacific plate would have had to move half a mile a year *at a minimum*.  In fact, it would have to move faster than that because although the earth may be 6000 years old, we know that the Pacific plate has not been moving that fast for *at least* the last few hundred years, so the amount of time available to build the Hawaiian islands is even less than that.

So it's not that an old earth is the only *possible* explanation.  It may very well be that the Pacific plate was moving faster in the past.  The problem is that in order to compress the time line down to 6000 years it has to be moving *absurdly* fast, faster than any known physical mechanism could possibly move it.  And if it really had moved that fast in the past, that should have left lots of other evidence.

The only other possibility is that the Hawaiian islands chain was built by some other mechanism, in which case the next question is obviously: what was it?  What mechanism would build a 3000-mile-long island chain along a line that just happens to be parallel to the modern-day direction of motion of the Pacific plate?

Sure.  The Bible also says that we humans are sinners.  That doesn't mean we need to capitulate and stop trying to sin.  We have free will.  We can choose to try not to sin, and we can choose to try to heal conflicts rather than create them, and we can choose to do both of these things despite the fact that we are doomed to fail.  I choose to try to heal.

Cool!  There's something you and I agree on!  See, we're making progress already.

&gt; In the case of evolution (UCD) and old earth, all the available evidence is being run axiomatically through the interpretive filter of naturalism and uniformitarianism,

Yes.

I could as easily say that creationism runs all the available evidence axiomatically through the interpretive filter of the inerrancy of the Bible, creating the illusion of a young earth irrespective of its actual age.  All reasoning has to start from some foundational assumption.  Mine is that the universe behaves according to laws that can be deduced from the evidence.  Yours is that the truth can only be obtained through divine revelation.

&gt; &gt; Even creationists believe in ""micro-evolution""

&gt; No, actually we don't.

OK, that's news to me.  Here's a source:

http://www.scriptureoncreation.org/macro-vs-microevolution.html

""scientists have made a strong case for the phenomena of microevolution""

&gt; There is no such thing as a self-replicating molecule that can function in the absence of any cells.

Not today.  That primitive life form has gone extinct along with countless others.

&gt; the cell, by definition, is the smallest unit of life

Maybe by your definition, not by mine.

&gt; even if you claim the precursor to the first cell was some kind of hypothetical self-replicating molecule, this moment when the first cell came into being was, by definition, the moment of 'abiogenesis'. And any such chance occurrence would resemble Hoyle's analogy due to the overwhelming design present in the cell.

I don't think it's productive to quibble over terminology, but as soon as a self-replicating molecule came into being, Darwinian evolution began.  Cells were among the products of that evolutionary process, and so were not a ""chance occurrence.""  Cells are quite far along in the evolutionary process.  By the time you get to a cell, you've got somewhere on the order of 10% or so of the chemistry that makes a human.  Cells are absolutely not the beginning of the process.

&gt; &gt; don't confuse evolution and abiogenesis

&gt; I didn't.

You did, and you continue to do so.

&gt; &gt; I am absolutely not committed to my belief in abiogenesis. Panspermia is entirely possible, as is creation by intelligent aliens.

&gt; So you are excluding creation by God from even the realm of possibility.

Absolutely not.  I just think it's even less likely than creation by intelligent aliens, which I think it pretty unlikely (and I suspect you agree with that).

&gt; What kind of scientific evidence available to us would change your view?

Hard to say.  The kind of evidence that produces scientific revolutions is very hard to imagine before it appears.  But some communication with intelligent aliens would probably do it.  I'm guessing that if God spoke to me, that would do it to.

Evolution came directly out of naturalism, and the whole guiding principle behind the idea of evolution is naturalism.

**""Neither the organization of the universe nor life as we know it had to evolve as it did. Chance played a central role.""**  


Sounds like straightforward atheism to me. Properly understood, evolutionism is purely atheistic. Evolutionary scientists don't imagine that God is sitting back and causing mutations to happen in a miraculous way in order to somehow guide evolution's progress. It's supposed to be based upon chance. If you have some other theory that involves intentional miracles being the cause of mutations, then that's certainly not Darwinian evolution at all.

I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is. 

Sure, I'll grant that. If you use the tornado in the junkyard analogy when attempting to refute Universal Common Descent then you'll be making no sense.  


&gt; No. My belief in *abiogenesis* is ""a faith commitment to naturalism"" (though I wouldn't phrase it quite that way). But my belief in *evolution* (and an old earth) are based on overwhelming evidence. 

No, both UCD and abiogenesis are rooted in a faith commitment to naturalism. In the case of evolution (UCD) and old earth, all the available evidence is being run axiomatically through the interpretive filter of naturalism and uniformitarianism, creating the illusion of 'overwhelming evidential support' where there is none.  


&gt; Even creationists believe in ""micro-evolution"", so here again you seem to be seeking to create conflict that doesn't actually exist. Why do you do that? What goal does it serve? Do you believe that this is how Jesus wants you to behave? 

No, actually we don't. We believe in the designed ability for life to vary within the original created kinds, and we also allow for the fact that some variation we see today is a result of damaging mutations which came about as a result of the Fall.  


 [https://creation.com/arguments-we-think-creationists-should-not-use#micro\_macro](https://creation.com/arguments-we-think-creationists-should-not-use#micro_macro) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It's a straw man. No one claims that abiogenesis produced a fully working cell 

It's not a straw man when your only grounds for making a distinction are imaginary! According to real science, the smallest unit of life [is the cell](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-1559-6_2).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; only a self-replicating molecule 

There is no such thing as a self-replicating molecule that can function in the absence of any cells.  


&gt;  By the time you get to a cell, even a prokaryotic one, you're already way beyond what anyone claims could have been produced by abiogenesis. 

Again, I have to emphasize the fact that the cell, by definition, [is the smallest unit of life](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-1559-6_2). So even if you claim the precursor to the first cell was some kind of hypothetical self-replicating molecule, this moment when the first cell came into being was, by definition, the moment of 'abiogenesis'.  And any such chance occurrence would resemble Hoyle's analogy due to the overwhelming design present in the cell.  


&gt; don't confuse evolution and abiogenesis 

I didn't. They are both united by a common thread which is a faith commitment to naturalism above all else.  


&gt; I am absolutely not committed to my belief in abiogenesis. Panspermia is entirely possible, as is creation by intelligent aliens. 

So you are excluding creation by God from even the realm of possibility. See how you are not really open to the evidence after all? Not really willing to go where it leads, if it leads to God? You are willing to become a creationist if our creators are aliens, but not if our Creator is Yahweh.   


&gt; I don't see any evidence for either of those, so my money is currently on abiogenesis here on earth, but if you can show me evidence that some other hypothesis is more plausible, I'll change my view.

Ah, thanks for pointing him out.  I didn't know he was the origin of the tornado-in-the-junkyard story.

No it isn't.  It's a straw man.  No one claims that abiogenesis produced a fully working cell, only a self-replicating molecule.  By the time you get to a cell, even a prokaryotic one, you're already way beyond what anyone claims could have been produced by abiogenesis.

&gt; Your belief in evolution is here unmasked to be a faith commitment to naturalism which is unfalsifiable.

No.  My belief in *abiogenesis* is ""a faith commitment to naturalism"" (though I wouldn't phrase it quite that way).  But my belief in *evolution* (and an old earth) are based on overwhelming evidence.  Even creationists believe in ""micro-evolution"", so here again you seem to be seeking to create conflict that doesn't actually exist.  Why do you do that?  What goal does it serve?  Do you believe that this is how Jesus wants you to behave?

BTW, note that we could have avoided this entire argument if you'd actually paid attention to the advice I was giving: don't confuse evolution and abiogenesis.  So yes, I actually am here to help (unless, of course, your goal is to create conflict rather than to seek the truth.  In that case, I will try to thwart you.  There is enough conflict in the world already.)

BTW2, I am absolutely not committed to my belief in abiogenesis.  Panspermia is entirely possible, as is creation by intelligent aliens.  I don't see any evidence for either of those, so my money is currently on abiogenesis here on earth, but if you can show me evidence that some other hypothesis is more plausible, I'll change my view.",1577723775

In my experience dealing with countless atheists, your attitudes and arguments are very much typical of what I hear. Sorry to burst your bubble. 

&gt;The fastest way to identify yourself as an ignorant quack is to raise the tornado-in-a-junkyard-building-a-747 argument. 

This 'argument' (falsely so-called) was first coined by a  well-decorated and renowned scientist by the name of Dr Fred Hoyle, who by the way was not a Christian. So I wouldn't be so cavalier about calling anyone who uses it a quack.  It's more of an analogy than an argument.   


In any case the principles behind the analogy are very sound in refuting abiogenesis. Here is an excerpt from the preface to Pollard &amp; Earnshaw's (secular) Cell Biology textbook:  


***""It is therefore tempting to compare cells to a complex piece of machinery, like a jet airliner, whose complexity may rival certain aspects of the cell. However, cells are much more complex than jet airliners.""***

  
Hoyle's analogy is only inappropriate in that he did not go far enough. A tornado (representative of natural forces) whipping through a junkyard (representative of raw non-living building blocks of life) which happened to assemble a functioning jet plane (representing a living cell), would be much LESS improbable than actual abiogenesis.  


&gt; Don't raise arguments-from-ignorance. Yes, it is true that science does not yet know exactly how (or even if) abiogenesis happened, nor does it know the exact lineage of every species that has ever existed. But there was a time when science didn't know how electricity worked. The fact that we have not yet figured out how nature does something is not a valid argument that God did it. 

Your belief in evolution is here displayed to be a faith commitment to naturalism which is unfalsifiable. Any evidence which shows evolution is impossible will simply be classed by you as an 'argument from ignorance'. Actually, it is the opposite. It's an argument from what we *do know*:  that natural processes do not, and could not even in theory, produce the effects we see around us. You disallow God as the Creator because that conclusion is not what you want to hear. All the evidence you need to conclude God created is already sitting in front of you, and you choose to reject it in favor of blind faith in naturalism.",1577716765

This does not justify your ad hoc correlation is causation fallacy.

&gt;""Origen and Augustine in particular clearly rejected the idea that the creation days were normal calendar days.""

Augustine literally didn't believe in day-age, he thought creation was instantaneous so it's completely irrelevant to the point you're trying to make. Not to mention that Origen was kinda vague on it, and sought spiritual meanings. But here is what he did say:

The text said that “there was evening and there was morning,” it did not say: “the first day,” but said, “one day.” It is because there was not yet time before the world existed. But time begins to exist with the following days.[12](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/efc5ig/interested_in_discussing_genesis_1_with_young/fcios9d/?context=3#_ftn1)

t1_fc6o5rt,nomenmeum,"&gt;You're inordinately sanguine about eliciting my agreement :)
 

Pardon :)  Bad rhetorical habit.

 

Let me just list the things I accept, and you tell me whether or not you think they are reasonable.

 

1) The differences between MD and Stonehenge are fewer than those between a prokaryote and you.

 

2) The transition from MD to Stonehenge requires timing and coordination. 

 

For instance you cannot lay out the saracen stones without planning where to put them *first,* and you cannot put the lintels on top without *first* erecting the supporting stones, and you cannot carve a tongue anywhere you like on one lintel without coordinating its size and placement with the groove of the other lintel, and you cannot put the mortice holes in them without coordinating their size, shape and location with the tenons of the supporting stones, etc.  These are just the obvious examples.  I'm sure those who built it could provide a host of others.

 

3)  There is no natural mechanism to account for the necessary timing and coordination of the proposed erosion and glacial deposition.

 

4) The transition from prokaryote to you requires *far more* timing and coordination, and it also requires *simultaneous action.*

 

As for the timing and coordination, [watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGPpKk-6-K0&amp;feature=youtu.be)  It is a very effective demonstration of the sort of ""tongue and groove"" fitting and alignment of one aspect of a eukaryote's structure.  Obviously, timing and coordination (on a much grander scale) would be involved in moving from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

 

As for the simultaneous action, that is necessary because we are talking about living things.  There is no way to ""kill"" the Stonehenge project.  I suspect there were stages of Stonehenge's construction that had to be simultaneous, but it seems to be less of an issue than with the prokaryote to eukaryote transition.  It doesn't really matter, for instance, if the tongue of one lintel is carved *at the same time* as the groove of the corresponding lintel, but this is not the case with the transition from prokaryote to eukaryote.  Just as in surgery many things have to be monitored and maintained simultaneously (beyond the immediate task of the surgery itself) so with any transition that involves stages that could kill the organisms outright if they are not simultaneously coordinated. 

 

5) There is *no natural mechanism* for coordinating and timing random mutations with natural selection.",1577645357
t1_fcgwbco,vivek_david_law,Sure but I don't think it's dishonest to say that just because something is dated to 30 my doesn't actually mean it's 30 my old and that seems perfectly in line with modern science and modern radiometric dating to the point where I feel pretty confident I can get many people in the field to agree to this,1577644817
t1_fcgsqsz,stcordova,"&gt; going from that to we can date rocks by extrapolating radioactive decay for thousands millions and billions of years and get a date that is fairly accurate is an extrapolation that has many problems.

I think ""some problems that may be deal beakers"" is a more balanced characterization.   The YEC accounting for radio metric dating has much greater problems than the Old Earth model, and I say that as professional researcher favorable to YEC who has a physics background (I studied physics before I worked in the biology field).

I don't say that, and any creationist who does isn't helping the creationist cause.

&gt;Genetic Entropy.

""**Reductive Evolution**"" is the politically correct term, and that has been observed on many levels and is real.  Darwinists pretend Genetic Entropy isn't real.  Ok, so how about the term ""**Reductive Evolution**""?

One of the worlds top evolutionary biologists even said:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23801028

&gt;**Genome reduction as the dominant mode of evolution**

&gt;A common belief is that evolution generally proceeds towards greater complexity at both the organismal and the genomic level, numerous examples of **reductive evolution** of parasites and symbionts notwithstanding. However, recent evolutionary reconstructions challenge this notion....Quantitatively, **the evolution of genomes appears to be dominated by reduction and simplification**, punctuated by episodes of complexification.

Darwinism isn't a scientific theory, it only pretends to be.

&gt;radiometric dating 

Radiometric dating is a credible scientific theory, but it is not without some serious anomalies and concerns.

&gt;thus argue against these things. 

Absolutely we should argue against these things to the extent they don't agree with measurable and observable facts.  Darwinism doesn't agree with measurable and observable facts.  

Radio metric dating has a lot more agreement with measurable and observable facts. To over turn radiometric dating we need to have measurable and observable facts that will overturn it.  

If a theory has some concordance with observable and measurable facts, we don't just toss out a theory because we don't like what it says or it doesn't agree with our religion or personal beliefs.  We toss it out because it fails on not being able to reconcile the physical observable and measurable quantities it claims to explain.

If collectively creations act like they're going to believe whatever they're committed to believe despite any possible observable data point that will come their way, it won't inspire people who are reasonably skeptical to trust what creationist have to say.",1577643232

Totally. If you get challenged on this it feels like intentional confusion. Evolution without abiogenesis is too open ended. I could then claim the earth is 6000 years old, God created all animals after their kind, and since then evolution has split those kinds into different species. But if you'd claim that then you get the response that that is not what evolution is about.

t1_fcblgkn,marektypes,"&gt;R.A. Torrey (1856-1928), founder of Talbot Seminary and editor of The Fundamentals (12 volumes, published in 1910): “Anyone who is at all familiar with the Bible and the way the Bible uses words, knows that the use of the word ‘day’ is not limited to twenty-four hours. It is frequently used to denote a period of entirely undefined length…There is no necessity whatsoever for interpreting the days of Genesis 1 as solar days of twenty-four hours length.”16  
&gt;  
&gt;J. Gresham Machen (1881-1937), considered the last of the great orthodox Princeton theologians: “It is certainly not necessary to think that the six days spoken of in that first chapter of the Bible are intended to be six days of twenty four hours each. We may think of them rather as very long periods of time.”\[17\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Edward J. Young (1907-1968), regarded as the epitome of conservative exegetical orthodoxy: “But then there arises the question as the length of these days. That is a question which is difficult to answer. Indications are not lacking that they may have been longer than the days we now know, but the Scripture itself does not speak as clearly as one might like.”\[18\]  
&gt;  
&gt;James Montgomery Boice (1938-2000), chairman of the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy: “\[Young-earth\] creationists insist that the days cover a literal 24 hours, but this is not necessarily the case. Sometimes the word ‘day’ is used with a broader meaning…it can mean a period of indefinite duration.”19 “Any view that makes the earth 12 to 20 thousand years old flies in the face of too much varied and independent evidence to be tenable. In my judgment the earth and universe are indeed billions of years old.”20

This is such an ad hoc correlation is causation fallacy. The fact of the matter is that correlation is NOT causation, you have to demonstrate that it is. Until you can do that, these quotations do absolutely nothing. Demonstrate that these quotes are caused by evolutionary theory, and then you've proved something.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you look at the dates they are all very close on the heels of the publication of Darwin's origin.

Irrelevant ad hominem / genetic fallacy. You cannot discern the truth of day-age by how one came to believe it, not to mention the fact that you haven't demonstrated how they came to believe it in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The day age idea was entertained by Augustine and probably much further back than that- you can trace the roots of evolutionary thinking back to anaximander in 600ish bc so the competing thought processes have been around for a long time, they have manifested in scholarship in the minds of believers and non believers alike over the centuries and don't exist in a vacuum. We deceive ourselves if we think that one does not influence the other. 

This simply shows the misunderstanding on your part, brother, and I mean this with no offense.  


**Augustine did not believe in day-age theory. He believed that the creation was instantaneous.** 

So I really have no clue why you're saying ""day-age idea was entertained by Augustine"" when he didn't even believe in it! That's ludicrous. I think it's clear you're just cherry-picking the evidence here, and it's not appreciated.",1577626979

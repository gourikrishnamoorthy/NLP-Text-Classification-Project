t1_ffiumeb,GaryGaulin,"&gt;All your experiments showed was that it may be possible to form RNA. It didn’t show how information in RNA and DNA could form.

Self-replicating molecules that evolved over time [Gerald Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Joyce) is famous for having been the first to develop do not have a random distribution of nucleotides in their sequences. Over time it's what you are calling nonrandom ""information"" that fills a tiny test environment. 

The links led to thousands more containing repeatable chemistry experiments to generate recognizable ""information"" patterns found in modern cells where there has since been billions of years worth of refinement of the most useful sequences to through replication amplify until it fills an entire planet, including living things that live deep in the warm mantle. 

Molecular structure of active sites of cell enzymes have rock/mineral equivalents with the same catalytic action. It's nice to have cell sized portable versions of rocks many times their size, but there is nothing wrong with staying close to home where useful active sites are well provided by the surface of the minerals they grow into.

The real problem I see is from not wanting to think about things that became known by the year 2020. Conspiracy theories and misinformation made it easy for some to completely ignore what is happening in reality, where there is now a lot of studying and molecular pathway based explaining to do before being able to responsibly describe to the general public.

I bolded some of the important things that should have been flashing like a strobe light at you:

t3_etledc,ThurneysenHavets,"&gt;That would involve showing how, given a realistic (or even an unrealistic, like those above) set of assumptions, deleterious mutations actually do accumulate constantly in a genome.

I have a question. Something I've wondered about for some time:

You're making this argument in general theoretical terms, implying that it would apply regardless of the relevant biological parametres. As in, genetic entropy is inherently a contradiction in terms and therefore cannot ever happen.

Well, suppose you imagine a hypothetical human population, where we artificially raise the mutation rate by increments and observe the consequences. Such that it gradually increases from 100 per person per generation to 200, to 300, to 400 etc.

Are you arguing this population would, every time we ramped up the mutation rate, just settle on a new mutation-selection equilibrium? Ad infinitum? Or would the elevated mutation rate eventually cause a problem, and what would the nature of that problem be?",1579989862
t1_ffikxeq,CTR0,"Are you assuming that that is the only possible sequence?

Are you still assuming 1 sample per second?

Are you still assuming only one simultaneous RNA?

Did you fully read my reply?",1579989838
t1_ffj2ex4,misterme987,I guess we’ll both go on not understanding each other then. Fine with me.,1579989004
t1_ffj1vq9,cubist137,"Of course I don't. Which is why I don't buy your argument that ""The only observable source of information today, such as that in DNA, is an intelligent mind, therefore DNA was created by an intelligent mind"".

If you're restricting yourself to ***observable*** phenomena, you *must* accept that human beings created DNA. But if you're *not* restricting yourself to observable phenomena, the (alleged) information in DNA *must* have come from *something else*, and it's not at all clear why you would insist that this ""something else"" *must necessarily* be an intelligent mind.",1579988682
t1_ffj1g4x,misterme987,"Okay. So would you say then, that DNA must have been produced by humans?",1579988302
t1_ffiyvhy,misterme987,"No, because there’s *no chemical interaction between bases from top to bottom*.

t1_ffj0y61,ThurneysenHavets,"&gt;It's a mess I don't know how to resolve.

Isolated datapoints don't weigh up against systematic agreement between independent methods. You could pick holes in pretty much any widely accepted empirical observation that way. The agreement between dating methods well applied is [breathtaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eh4ytp/the_issue_isnt_science_its_philosophy_okay_uvivek/).

t1_ff14hje,JohnBerea,"&gt; the empirical work doesn't seem to accord with it:  ""Of the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.""

At this time we don't know the exact function of &gt; 98% of nucleotides in the genome.  Even if we did, the function is [highly redundant](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6131.long), ""such that double or triple disruptions are required for a phenotypic consequence.""

My [Junk DNA article](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna) makes the case that enough of our DNA is functional that we likely receive dozens of deleterious mutations per generation, based on several overlapping evidences of function, even though we usually don't know what specific functions a nucleotide contributes to.

&gt; Do you think there's significant empirical evidence that genomes are generally deteriorating?

I think the process is so slow in large complex animals like us that it's hard to measure.  I have this blurb saved in my notes, but I haven't yet had time to dig through the research behind it:

1.  ""the results suggest that humans are carrying around larger numbers of deleterious mutations than they did a few thousand years ago. But this doesn’t mean that humans now are more susceptible to disease, says Akey.
Rather, it suggests that most diseases are caused by more than one variant, and that diseases could operate through different genetic pathways and mechanisms in different people.""

If we were to group HIV differently, we would have seen some go “extinct”. If the criteria which sorted various genomes  into a “strain” were narrow  enough, at some point due to mutations that met those criteria. I know that might not be self-evident, so I’ll make an absurdist example to demonstrate it. Imagine that a “strain” was defined having a singular and exact genome as the criteria for set inclusion. Only in the case that  mutation from that genome was deleterious would one anticipate that exact genome lasting more than few generations. Any possibility of positive or neutral mutations would mean that the original genome would very quickly becoming increasingly less represented among an ever-increasing number of other (presumably similarly defined) virus genomes. 

Now of course, HIV strains aren’t defined that way. There is considerable genetic variation within a strain. The particular boundaries of what genomes are included in a strain have been rationally developed, but are in some sense still arbitrary. They have been defined as having particular attributes in genotype or etiology, and are defined broadly enough to be useful (having a strain per genome is pointless) for categorization, but narrow enough to allow useful description.

t3_etledc,MRH2,"Thanks for defining your terms and for this post.

&gt; Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we also remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

&gt; So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.   
after 2: 12/2/16.   
after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)   
One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial.

I want to figure out what you're saying here. 
Let's assume that at that mutated site, A is the original base. With 1 beneficial and two deleterious, lets say that beneficial is A-&gt;T and deleterious is A--&gt;G and A-&gt;C. 

So with one deleterious mutation, A-&gt;C happens. We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (beneficial relative to C),     
C-&gt;T (very beneficial relative to C), and     
C-&gt;G (from one bad thing to a different bad thing)

&gt; So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. 

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 2/1/0

Initially we postulated 1 b and 2d at this site. Now we have 2b and one n. **BUT** the problem is how you are defining things. You're saying that it's beneficial relative to where it is now.  If we look at the original genome and see what it is, we get a different situation:

A bad mutation has happened (A-&gt;C).  We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (neutral relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;T (beneficial relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;G (deleterious relative to the original genome)

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 1/1/1

I have trouble with you defining C-&gt;A as beneficial and C-&gt;G as neutral.  I suspect that if you follow it through using this way of looking at it, you'll end up with quite different results (maybe you or someone could crank this out. I had to actually use 4 specific bases in order to follow what's going on). And these results should provide a better match to observations of harmful mutations building up in populations (assuming that this is what we see).",1579957232

This is a problem for two reasons: 

First, if, as they claim, the pre-'09 strains went extinct in '09, then it's completely inappropriate the just add all the mutations together - the '09 pandemic should represent a completely new lineage. 

Second, we know that the '09 pandemic was a reassorted (i.e. recombinant) strain, so most of those differences weren't due to single-base point mutations - they were due to recombination between different strains.

4. Not relevant. Because, mutations occur - good and bad. The bad ones that do lead to death don’t get passed on and the rest just keep on spreading those alleles.

There was no non-sequitur because when you start with one gene and a mutated form arises now you have two forms and if two new one arise from those now you have for such that a single population having a single version of a gene now has at least for so that diversity is the result. The alternative would be identical clones because of mutation so that every organism was identical so that no diversity existed. This variety is the necessary diversity for natural selection because without it a single environment would kill all of them at once or it wouldn’t have any purifying effect at all. To select you need variety to choose from. These work hand in hand.",1579952241

And going back to the paper myself, the answer is YES, that's exactly what they do. *That's* what figure 2 shows. They're counting cumulative mutations in H1N1 from 1917 *to 2012* across this supposed extinction.

There is no compelling evidence that even the adaptability of e.coli is from 'mutation'.  That is hypothesized. The more likely explanation is the INHERENT ability of bacteria to adapt, by the unique ability of making slight changes to it's enzyme secretion.  Mutations, as a force on EVERY organism,  are deleterious.  They do NOT increase complexity or add functions.  To ascribe to 'mutation!' this ability of ecoli is spurious, at best.  It is an interesting theory, but it is not clearly established that mutation was the mechanism for adaptation, in this specific case.  That is assumed.

Then, to seize upon this study as 'proof of common ancestry!', is a greater leap of faith (and logic).  There is no transitional form being 'created', even after 66,000 generations.  A fruit fly study went to millions of generations, with still no transitional forms being created, under forced laboratory conditions.

Varying enzyme secretion is an inherent trait..  it is not, scientifically,  an example of mutation.   That is a theory, and not a compelling one, imo.

But even if it could be shown that deleterious mutations of genes can occasionally 'help' a bacteria to adapt, which this study does not, it is a leap of faith to conclude 'common ancestry!', via mutation.

t1_ff85yt0,CHzilla117,"&gt;The thread title was about genetics as evidence for evolution so thats why your invoking fossils is out of order and you should be making your case on genetics anyways.

You said that the conclusion of Africa being the place of humanity's 
origin was ""wild"". While genetic evidence alone is more than sufficient, such accusations still warrant mentioning some of the evidence.

&gt;As i said variation is relative to need, at least as a option

That would first need to be demonstrated, and yet it never has. And the thing is, many populations of animals with low diversity would greatly benefit from such a mechanism if it existed, and yet they don't. Tests have shown again and again that diversity in a species do not happen you the way you wish it did.

And then fact that most of the diversity in question is non-coding parts and that, as repeatedly stated, the pattern is for what the original human population would look like is ridiculously specific and Africa fits it to a T.

&gt;its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive.

Take a small portion of a larger population of deer and put them in a new environment were they now have limited gene flow with the original population. These deer will only have a portion of the original population's diversity. Now, after the new population has grown did it again. This new population will have even less. Do it again and again and this is exactly what the pattern of human diversity is like. And seeing as how extensive study no other process does the same, calling it suggestive would be an understatement even ignoring the vast amount of fossil evidence..

&gt;Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity to others.

That was nothing to do with diversity. Traits like skin pigment are under selective pressure, and so are of little use Put fair skinned people under conditions and keep them isolated and slowly those with mutations for darker skin will become more common. And that is why such traits are not considered when who is descended from who. It is the parts of the genome that do not code for anything that are.

All you have shown is that you seem lack understanding of what genetic diversity, which is what is being debated about, even is in the first place.

&gt;Finally nothing has shown genetic change comes only, or at all, by mutations. they just presume that because they have no other idea of a mechanism to change dna.

Not ideas, observations. Seeing as how mutation is defined as ""the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, that is the definition. Mutations being a result of only random process or deliberate modification by humans using advanced technology has been repeatably tested, not just assumed and asserted as truth like you do.

&gt; peoples bodyplan differences since the flood is the great obvious evidence. its impossible where we needed some change that only a few offspring got it from mutations and only they created new populations. God would not allow that.

This is a good example of confusing the claim for evidence, which is ultimately all you have done here. You assume a YEC timeline because of what you perceive the Bible to say, and take that as evidence. But the Bible would only be a claim, not evidence. And all you have done is ignore all actual evidence and make things up and claim them as fact.

And Bible isn't even the claim, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, which you quiet tellingly have ignored, in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/emxcfo/whats_the_creationist_explanation_for_these_human/ff2cblf/).

Lol, your boi Sanford is actually looking at swine flu fam.   
Sanford uses A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) as one of two reference genomes for his paper. These sequences were taken from the Christman et al. 2011 paper (erroneously referred to as Kedwaii et al. in Sanford's paper).  H1N1pdm reference strain A/California/04/2009 was classified as genotype  \[C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A\], with a lineage assigned sequentially to each of the eight genomic segments. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus arose from a reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, namely, a North American H1N2 and a Eurasian H1N1, each of which themselves arose from reassortments (Fig. 2) ([Garten et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0100), [Gibbs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0110), [Smith et al., 2009a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0275), [Smith et al., 2009b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0280), [Trifonov et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0315)). The North American swine virus was itself formed by at least two  previous reassortments in swine, contributing six segments: PB2, PB1,  PA, HA, NP, and NS. 

  
The quote from Sanford:

"" We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1  outbreak of 2009–2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. ""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an a**pparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.**""  

""Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, **and then again apparently in 2009;** and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

I'll repost some of the information you find necessary to ignore:

------------------------------------------------------

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

True to the reduced capacity for honesty in creationist circles, /u/PaulDouglasPrice flagrantly disregards 30 instances of the word ""extinct"" in relationship to H1N1 and unabashedly lies about it:   


  

""We document multiple **extinction** events, including the previously known **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.""

""These **extinctions** appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations.""

""Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957, when the human strain went **extinct**.""

""Apart from the 1917 pandemic, H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic, and human H1N1 essentially went **extinct** from 1957–1977.""

""Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual **extinction** of the viral strain.""

""Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (“lethal mutagenesis”) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain **extinction** \[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B25)\-[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B30)\].""

""Others have noted the temporal **extinction** of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""This discontinuity reflects the **extinction** of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s, followed by the re-introduction of the strain in 1976, presumably from a researcher’s freezer.""

""Notice that after re-introduction in 1976, the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the **extinction** occurred in the 1950s.""

""These fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 **extinction**.""

""However, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic (the porcine lineage had no **extinction** event, and hence no pause in mutation accumulation).""

""Human H1N1, the remnant of the 1918 lineage, appears to have gone **extinct** a second time.""

""Before its apparent **extinction** in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations (mostly point mutations), including 320 non-synonymous mutations, compared to the 1918 genotype.""

""This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time, perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as **extinction** approaches.""

""This is only possible if almost **all human influenza** lineages rapidly go **extinct**.""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the **extinction** of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second **extinction** event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. Strain **extinction** has often occurred when new strains appeared, including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3-like strains in 1917, H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957, and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""Our other evidences include: a) the **extinction** of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent **extinction** of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

""Finally, the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline, attenuation, **extinction** of most circulating strains, and even more frequent sub-lineage **extinction** events.""

""These facts, combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain **extinction**, all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.""

""Thus, the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual **extinction**.""

""Based on our mutation count analysis, there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone **extinct**, apparently twice.""

""The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago, and there has been universal **extinction** of all earlier human influenza strains.""

""Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went **extinct** in 1957, but was reintroduced in 1976, apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s.""

t1_ffgw1do,PaulDouglasPrice,"I'll explain this to you very clearly. They are referring to the specific strain they call the ""human version"" of H1N1, which is frequently called Spanish Flu. It came about in 1917 and went extinct first in the 1950s. It was re-released from containment in the 1970s and then went extinct a second time in 2009. However, in the 1950s the human strain jumped into swine before it went extinct. That swine version made a jump back to humans in 2009, and the mutational load shows a linear progression going all the way back to 1917. So even though the Spanish Flu jumped to pigs and reassorted, it kept accumulating mutations nonetheless. And this is why the 2009 swine flu was very weak compared to many fears. It was already highly attenuated when it jumped back to humans.

t1_ffgtyi8,arcturisvenn,"The word ""information"" is difficult to define without context, and you're playing with that ambiguity to try to make this argument.

In the general sense, information is just what we call it when a something could conceivably exist in multiple states, but that uncertainty has been resolved and it exists in only one of those states. Imagine three rocks in a line on the beach (A, B, and C). Picking a starting point and moving down the line, the order could be any of six sequences: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, or CBA. But even though there are six possible arrangements, the rocks exist in only one of the six. Let's say its BCA. That is information. The existence of information is in no way contingent on an intelligent agent.

You're blurring that with the idea of idea of encoding and decoding information. Systems can take information and encode it into a storage medium. You have already provided two examples: synaptic connections in the brain and cave paintings. Another obvious example is written language. Later on we decode that storage medium to get the information back. You see a tiger, you write ""I saw a tiger"" in a letter and mail it to  me, I read the letter and I know that you saw a tiger. We encoded and decoded information. Even here, there is no basis to assert that says a system needs to be intelligent to encode or decode information. Most life lacks any cognitive ability whatsoever, and they still manage to receive, store, transmit, and respond to information.

You're giving examples of ""encoding information"" but passing them off as if they were ""producing information"". It really doesn't matter which one we look at, except for clarity sake.

Indeed very small *individual* mutations may escape selective pressure. But sooner or later, *many* of them will inevitably surpass the threshold of selective pressure. And then they will be weeded out by selection.

And the funny thing here is that creationists, unknowingly and naively, actually bring in arguments that endorse this: they say that genetic entropy will occur, degrading the genome. But degrading the genome implies that fitness will inevitably decrease. So, to bolster that, Price came up a week ago with many examples of what he thinks happens in humans (all kinds of genetic conditions and the like). But as soon these happen and while such conditions ARE affecting fitness, as extensively explaned by Price himself, selection WILL kick in. *Unless* we prevent natural selection to act by medical intervention. IF deteriration of the human genome happens it's most likely due to unabling natural selection by humans themselves.

t1_ffbcxuo,Denisova,"&gt; There is no evidence humans ever had tails. its all a error probility curves.

Of course there is no evidence for that because humans do not have tails. and it's not about error probability curves or whatever fancy words you invoke to look like savvy, it's just because humans do not have tails.

Also the great apes do not have tails. Losing the tail happened in the common ancestor of the hominids. And we do have evidence of that, in embryonic gestation and in our genes.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF). The embryonic tail is composed of several complex tissues besides the developing vertebrae, including a secondary neural tube (spinal cord), a notochord, mesenchyme, and tail gut. These anatomic feats are typical and defining of the vertebrate tail. By the eighth week of gestation, the sixth to twelfth vertebrae have disappeared via cell death, and the fifth and fourth tail vertebrae are still being reduced. Likewise, the associated tail tissues also undergo cell death and regress. The remnant of vertebrae that remain shrink and fuse and eventually form the coccyx.

Moreover, we still have all the tail genes also found in animals that still wag a tail. In fact, the genes that control the development of tails in mice and other vertebrates have been identified (the Wnt-3a and Cdx1 genes). These tail genes have also been found in the human genome. As discussed below in detail, the development of the normal human tail in the early embryo has been investigated extensively, and apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays a significant role in removing the tail of a human embryo after it has formed. It is now known that down-regulation of the Wnt-3a gene induces apoptosis of tail cells during mouse development, and similar effects are observed in humans. Additionally, researchers have identified a mutant mouse that does not develop a tail, and this phenotype is due to a regulatory mutation that decreases the Wnt-3a gene dosage. 

We do not even need to know about the fossil evidence of the loss of the tail in hominid ancestors. The embryoonic and genetic evidence says it all.",1579912993
t3_eti3z7,DefenestrateFriends,"What do you want to know/understand about it? Here's a breakdown of what they did, but it in no way supports GE, the extinction of H1N1, or that most mutations are bad.   


  

The authors took all available accession numbers \[numbers used to identify data in GeneBank\] for flu genomes from the Influenza Research Database(Zhang et al., 2017), Fluegenome.org (which looks is no longer available as of 1/24/2020)(Lu et al., 2007), and 2009-2010 H1N1 versions from a paper (Christman et al., 2011). They took the accession numbers and grabbed the genomic data from GenBank resulting in 3,755 human and 351 swine genomes. Then, they performed a multiple sequence alignment (which they said was quite easy because of how few indels there were #irony). Taking those alignments, they then compared the sequences to a reference H1N1 genome (which one they used isn’t clear in the methods, presumably it was California/04/2009 from the (Christman et al., 2011) study which they keep referencing by the second author, Kedwaii).   
 

From here, they present two lines of analysis: 1) they calculate mutation differences from this holotype genome through 2010 and 2) they calculate the mutations from H1N1 strains from 1918 to 2012 using a slightly modified A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 genome as the reference. 

The mutation differences are calculated as SNPs, indels, transitions, transversions, non-synonymous amino acid changes, dN/dS ratio (non-syn to synonymous changes), protein length, normalized codon scores (NSC), and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU).

Figure 1 shows the mutations from the California/04/2009 up through the last H1N1 genome sequenced/collected in 2010. The last sequence has 80 mutations compared to the first sequence. They fit a regression line and found a slope of 41.959 although they report it as 42.1. This means, on average, we expect H1N1 virus to mutate 42 alleles per year (Carter and Sanford, 2012).   
 

Figure 2 is essentially the same analysis but begins with the amended A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 reference and catalogues mutations until 2012 using available sequences. The authors comment on a 1950’s extinction followed by a 1976 reintroduction of the virus. It’s unclear that these viruses are actually that well-related on the basis of this graph which seems to suggest distinct lineages merging around this time (notice the jump around 1980 from 1000 mutations to 1500 which linearly correlates with the 2009 outbreak strain). The authors do comment on the two distinct lineages of frozen versus non-frozen H1N1 strains i.e.—zoonosis causing antigenic shift. 

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing that there two distinct lineages of H1N1 being shown, they readjusted the timeframes and were able to re-calculate mutation rates per year which are shown in Figure 3. The top lines shows the corrected mutation rate of 14.4 per year and the bottom line shows the number of non-synonymous mutations per year (2.4). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the paper starts to break down:

Using these data, they estimate that the first arrival of H1N1 to be around 1893 and suggest that since it’s arrive until 1918, 325 new mutations were acquired (25 years x 15 mutations per year, even though the number is actually 14.4 according to their data). 

Now, the authors essentially assert and use language which insinuates “deleterious effects” from those mutations in the organism. For example, they say “nucleotide degeneracy” to mean “the nucleotide changed.” It doesn’t actually mean the mutation was bad. They also say, “further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non-adaptive.” That doesn’t mean deleterious, that literally means “the majority of mutations don’t increase fitness” i.e.—they can be deleterious *or neutral*.  

Figure 4 is the same analysis as before, but now shows the samples derived from porcine versus those derived from humans. Nothing terribly interesting here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The remaining figures graphically represent the type of mutation occurring between the lineages over time.   


Many of the conclusions they draw aren't supported by what they actually showed. For example, nothing in this paper evaluates fitness of the mutations they characterized.

t3_eseb2k,Denisova,"&gt; Humans had a tailbone right?

We still do have one, the coccyx.

Probably you meant ""humans once had tails"" but this is also wrong because not humans once had tails but one of their evolutionary ancestors. That would even be one of the ancestors of the Hominidae (=all great apes and humans and extinct species of hominids) because chimps, bonobos, gorillas and orang utans do not have tails either.

So you want to see fossils. Indeed we have many many fossils of hominids, more than 6000 altogether but all these are of hominids, not their common ancestor. That's mostly because that common ancestor was a forest dweller and tropical forests don't preserve fossils quite well, that's why we have rather abundant fossils of hominids in the human lineage because those left the forests and also why we don't have much fossils of chimpanzee evolution.

The hominid fossils indeed show a neat and chronological transition in traits from ape-like to human forms, like a gradual increase in skull volume, getting shorter arms but londer and stronger legs and gradual improvement in upright gait.

Now what about the tail. We have morphological and genetic evidence of tail vestiges.

First of all during embryonic gestation, humans start to develop a tail, which in later stages disappears again. human embryos initially develop tails in development. At between four and five weeks of age, the normal human embryo has 10-12 developing tail vertebrae which extend beyond the anus and legs, [accounting for about 15% of the total length of the embryo](http://embryo.soad.umich.edu/carnStages/stage16/16sagSlices.GIF).

t1_fffz6je,ursisterstoy,"Now that I’ve explained how evolution actually works a couple times and it was already explained how organisms diversify to exploit available niches following an extinction event could you please be a bit more clear about what you are talking about here?

So are you suggesting that cockroaches and stag beetles are practically the same thing? 

These are the types of differences we already see among beetles. They’re still beetles because they have to be. Their ancestors were beetles. The same species of beetle if you go back far enough but they’ve obviously each acquired traits that the other lacks even though all cockroaches look like cockroaches and all stag beetles look like stage beetles because of how heredity spreads genes about a breeding population but not with groups that they can no longer produce fertile offspring by trying to breed with. They may even be said to have profound differences. They didn’t occur all at once, but they did occur.

What about domesticated dogs? They’re not all just the same size and shape animal with a different color fur are they? Some have short noses, some have long ones. Some are long and slender, some are wide and stalky. These types of changes separate us from Homo neanderthalensis as both lineages likely diverged from something like Homo heidelbergensis. These are all humans but not all the same group you see all around you. Even more profound changes if you compare us to robust Paranthropus species or Chimpanzees but as these lineages diverged from our before all of us independently acquired our unique traits the ancestor of all of us may be something more like Graecopithecus or Sahelanthropus and not exactly like any of the resulting groups. This is hominini but you need to compare those animals, and not modern forms to the ancestor of gorillas and Nikalipithecus would be more like the common ancestor of humans and gorillas  which can be traced even further back to animals like Proconsul and Aegyptopithecus but always a minor change in each case and not like comparing us directly to living gibbons or colobus monkeys. We share a common ancestor with tarsiers before the emergence of monkeys with organisms like Eosimius and Darwinius  being close to the time of this split. Including more groups and the common ancestor of these already small primates is starting to look a lot more like the ancestor of tree shrews until we back far enough and the ancestor of both groups is the same animal with glires (rabbits and rodents) also starting out looking a bit like a shrew as well. This isn’t as hard to grasp when we consider that tree shrews, shrews, and elephant shrews are found within three of the four divergent groups of living placental mammals. Juramaia likely represents our split from the marsupials but it may have given birth to helpless young just like marsupials still do, just like monotremes do if it wasn’t for the eggs they lay immediately before their babies emerge out of them. If you keep going back, though, the fossil record has several gaps explained by genetics. It doesn’t mean that we don’t have fossils, but most of what we do have consists of teeth and bits of jaw once our direct ancestors became small, small enough to survive the event that killed the dinosaurs. They had already been growing small before that because they couldn’t compete with them. It was their small size that ultimately led to us but before dinosaurs were dominating our planet, it was our own lineage, the synapids that outcompeted the sauropsids (or everything more closely related to reptiles and birds than to mammals). Dimetrodon is one of such synapsids, even though it may not be directly ancestral. And what about the ancestor of something like that. They were much smaller and probably cold blooded like lizards and they looked a lot like lizards, at least superficially, which isn’t much of a jump when considering salamanders are a lot like amphibious lizards and the ancestor of reptiliamorphs was also amphibious like a salamander but it wasn’t a salamander or an amphibian. That’s where our lineage diverges from the lineage leading to amphibians and is approaching the move to land from a fish ancestor for which many examples exist - and a side branch, the lung fish, still lives to this day. If we were to keep going all the way back the earliest fish were more like swimming worms with several important changes between that and bony fish. 

So despite, nothing being all at once, or a leap from one fundamentally different kind of life to the next but successive tiers of superficial changes compiled upon fundamental similarities there’s nothing left to consider but how dog breeds and subspecies are a similar result from the same process but with humans being the selective pressure in one case and natural selection in the other we still have genetic drift, heredity, genetic isolation, and so on but all you need to add is time. The time necessary to lead to a greater amount of divergence so that isolated groups can no longer produce fertile offspring but instead infertile hybrids like the result of breeding a horse and donkey being a mule that itself is sterile. This is about the point where these isolated groups start to compile on the successive changes that don’t cross over into the other group and that’s when the profound differences between the groups become apparent. It isn’t between parents and children but between distant cousins that we find dramatic differences or if we happen to skip over several hundreds or thousands of generations like in the case of the the human-chimp common ancestor and how chimpanzees and humans both eventually wound up strikingly different from how they started and each other despite the persistent similarities (including having the same broken genes and retroviruses) that we use to help us work out how everything is related.",1579912530
t1_fffs9ld,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt;But viruses are nothing more than replication machines

Paul, if you like things that are 'nothing more than replication machines', the rest of the biosphere is going to *blow your mind*. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They just replicate. That is their only function, and the faster they replicate the more efficiently that replication machinery is working. 

For someone claiming *I* have it backwards, this is all kinds of wrong. First, you're deciding that replication is their only function, which implies, given your position regarding creation, that your specific god CREATES DEADLY REPLICATION ENGINES DELIBERATELY. And since you seem to be convinced that said deadly replication engines subsequently die out due to 'genetic entropy', this also directly suggests you think your specific god does this repeatedly, in real time, even today. Because...the lulz?

Secondly, you can't even get your efficiencies right. Faster != more efficient, especially since your entire argument *relies on the fact that viral replication is error prone*. Fast replication is sloppy replication, and fast replication that also kills the host is sloppy *and* counterproductive. Biology doesn't select for speed unless speed is useful, and here it is not. The 'wrench' as you describe it is absolutely beneficial (if it wasn't, it would be lost quickly), and yet you are STILL trying to argue that this is somehow detrimental, just so you can cleave to this clearly incorrect notion that viral mortality equates to viral fitness.",1579912091
t1_ffg813q,ursisterstoy,"Well there were extinctions that occurred before the Cambrian period ever started but otherwise that’s basically it. Whatever organisms exist in any given environment will exploit any available niche until some are better at it than others and that’s where natural selection plays a vital role. Then when most of them do eventually die off, whatever is left exploits those available niches that arise. One main reason for having more fossils starting around the Cambrian period is probably likely due to several extinctions as there was an evolutionary arms race geared towards survival. There may have been organisms filling similar niches before that but we just can’t find all of them because they aren’t well preserved. It may have even been a mass extinction event that we can’t find any fossil evidence for, but nothing like the great dying or the KT extinction events that are better known for such events.",1579908999
t1_fffsson,ursisterstoy,"I think I explained this a bit in my main response to the original post but now that I know what you’re actually talking about perhaps I can add a bit more. 

Consider the types of variation that don’t get acted on by natural selection but disperse throughout a population anyway like eye color. Consider those that are detrimental but get passed on anyway like diabetes. Alongside beneficial mutations others spread and it isn’t only natural selection that controls the variety of traits that eventually spread throughout a population. There is genetic isolation such that some trait in one isolated population doesn’t spread to the main population. This is how we tell sister groups apart like the various dog breeds. They exist simultaneously in the same environment for what natural selection would produce in different environments or among populations filling a different role within the environment. There’s heredity, which unlike genetic isolation, spreads these traits (good, bad, or otherwise) throughout the breeding population such that once enough time passes there will be a spreading about of traits that aren’t lethal or reproduction inhibitors. That’s how multiple people have green eyes and how others have blue or brown. They didn’t emerge from a six eyed predecessor but from a brown eyed ancestor and the descendants acquired mutations that provide the phenotypical trait of having a different colored eye. There’s more variation with eyes than just this, but this is a good example for this example. 

Genetic drift is when a specific gene type (allele) is eventually weeded our of the population. For whatever reason, call it chance, one trait becomes common down the road that doesn’t provide any known beneficial or detrimental side effects. And then on whatever is left after all of this is accounted for and as multiple mutations pile on top of those that don’t provide any known benefit or detrimental effect such that already common traits acquire the mutations that steer the development of the population through natural selection. Light skin in one area more often than another because it provides a benefit in terms of vitamin D production but dark skin in others because it provides better protection against the damaging radiation from the sun or the acquisition of a trait that allows humans to survive on less oxygen but isn’t necessary in another environment will be more common in areas with less oxygen like at the top of mountains. The single mutations on the way to producing these traits usually don’t get noticed but they spread throughout the population because of heredity and genetic drift. As the accumulating changes do provide a survival benefit or take one away they’ll gradually spread throughout the population accordingly except in cases where detrimental mutation results in death or infertility and then they don’t get passed on at all. 

Why organs in a different location or a different sized brain when the less significant mutations don’t get noticed on their own? Because without having much effect on survival and reproduction, the other traits are selected for instead as whatever is left surviving spreads their genes throughout a population - about 50% from each parent. Never the exact same ones being passed on unless considering identical twins. Whatever does get passed on from an essentially 50% combines with the 50% from the other parent and the phenotype is a consequence of the mix of genes. A recessive gene mutation may not get noticed at all until enough time has passed for a descendant to acquire two copies of the same gene and other traits may change almost right away. By the time these genes have spread throughout the population so that recessive traits start appearing or as more mutations pile upon what is already there as they too spread around the population is driven in a certain direction with some variation at the individual level but a more consistent trend across the population. Generally, because of population mechanics, the unique variations go unnoticed until they become common. By this time, further mutation can only build upon what is already present. 

There doesn’t need to be natural selection at every step of the way favoring one set and killing off the rest. It usually doesn’t kill everything all at once anyway allowing some of the persistent detrimental genes to acquire more mutations to turn them into beneficial ones as well. Why are groups so similar? Because of how evolution works. It doesn’t allow dramatic phenotypical change across a single generation such that a survivor of such a dramatic change is still able to breed and produce viable offspring with members of its own species that lack such a dramatic change. In some cases, such a dramatic change kills the embryo can even develop. 

Split the population up into smaller groups and they diverge both genetically and morphologically such that some mutations only occur in one group, or if they exist in the entire group, are quite rare in some and common in others - genetic drift and heredity. If in both cases survival and reproduction is still possible two or more related groups continue to drift apart so that their ability to interbreed correlated with the time they’ve been genetically isolated and once they can no longer inter-breed at all they may adapt to the same environment but in a different way as the genes from one group can no longer flow into the other. This is where more distantly related groups look and act more differently than the closely related groups and this is where homology plays a role as evidence of the time since divergence as well as the shared ancestry the groups all share. 

Now, with evolution explained, you should have at least a basic grasp on what you’re arguing against. A bit more understanding on why separate ancestry doesn’t withstand scrutiny. And perhaps even enough understanding to know that this entire process isn’t driven towards a teleological goal. The whole time superficial changes accumulate on top of fundamental similarities (with a bit of an explanation for how this happens) and why despite it not being particularly beneficial to have some specific organization in their body plans why different body plans arise and why this is sufficient evidence of common ancestry (though other excuses could be made for this with less support) 

This is why it isn’t just one piece of the puzzle or just one piece of evidence but an overwhelming preponderance of it that establishes evolutionary an inescapable fact of population genetics, despite some saying it is simple the best explanation we have. Life undergoes change and when looking at the facts such as the fundamental similarities, the mechanisms by which mutation, heredity, genetic drift, natural selection, sexual selection, and artificial selection act upon populations and the law of monophyly which states that all populations are a subset of their parent populations and can never transform into something completely new (because of how evolution works) and the law of biodiversity (these processes add both the variety within a population and are the mechanisms by which speciation occurs), there is no other way to explain the biodiversity we find on our planet but through evolution. 

Now, with that established we have also looked into the evolution for common ancestry and even several overlapping hypotheses for how it all originated in the first place, that creationism doesn’t stand up as an alternative explanation. It doesn’t provide anything accurate that can’t already be explained by the theory of evolution or by our findings in studying the processes by which simple chemistry *can* lead to life without supernatural intervention. And that’s where we turn to all of the evidence for the age of our planet and the surrounding solar system or for there never being a global flood and how the Bible is wrong in almost every way in these regards just like there is no firmament. It doesn’t exist. It wasn’t created on day two of creation week by an incantation spell. Of course, there are plenty of Christians okay with this. Fallible humans made stuff up and what they wrote isn’t meant to be taken literally or interpreted as actual history. And for that, I’d suggest BioLogos, unless you want to debate against my atheism in the proper forum.",1579908630
t1_ffdmz7c,WorkingMouse,"That does clear things up, thanks.  One tidbit for clarification from my end:

&gt;My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication.

This gets a ""sorta""; it's not a distinction I'd generally draw.  In a general sense, a mutation is an inherited difference in the sequence of the genome.  This is generally either a result of the replication machinery making a mistake (inserting the wrong base, jumping strands, etc.), by damage which causes such a mistake (example: UV light causes [pyrimidine dimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer) that cause the replication machinery to copy ""CT"" as ""TT""), or by inaccurate repair such as after a double-strand break.

For most of these things, there are ways they can be caught and repaired; slower-reproducing organisms often have system dedicated to specifically repairing more common mutations, or ""proof-reading"" capacity in their replication machinery.  This means that it's always going to be a race against time in a replicating cell; if they're not caught before the cells divide (again, in the case of mistakes during replication itself) then it's a mutation that will be carried by the daughter cell that gets the different copy.

Basically, you're right to say that changes can occur during or prior to replication, though changes prior often don't ""stick"" or necessarily even amount to a mutation until they cause a mistake during replication (or are repaired inaccurately).

And yes, given that our OP appears to think that enzymes with novel traits arising doesn't count as mutation, somehow, there's still something seriously amiss there.",1579907944
t3_eti3z7,Russelsteapot42,"It seems pretty straightforward to me: They tried to say that H1N1 demonstrates genetic entropy by claiming it is 'less fit' now than it used to be, and used mortality data to argue that point. 

This both ignores that the environment changed (There was significant government action to curb H1N1), but also falsely equivocates 'fitness' with 'mortality', as if killing one's host is the goal of a parasitic virus.

The refusal to accept that the only viable measure of 'fitness' is 'ability to survive and produce the next generation and ensure the next generation survives' is a core point of creationist denialism.",1579907627
t3_etc8gl,ursisterstoy,"We are talking about gradual change to the genetics such that one individual acquires the mutation before it spreads via population genetics. Most often these changes are minor or at least neither beneficial or detrimental for survival and reproduction though sometimes there are quite drastic changes because of some minor gene variation or the merging of chromosomes that limit the ability to produce viable offspring but doesn’t quite eliminate that possibility. 

So we have both minor changes and drastic ones but usually the drastic eventual changes don’t happen all at once. A few examples have probably been provided over at r/evolution but for our purposes consider wing development, eye development, brain enlargement and several traits like these that set different organisms apart. 

For wings, it depends on which group we are talking about as most often in tetrapod lineages this is the result of webbing or flaps of skin between the digits of the fingers or along the side of the body such as in colugos and other gliding animals. At first webbed fingers may not be much use for animals that don’t return to the water but if they live up in a tree like the ancestors of pterosaurs and bats or several of these other examples, those that acquired successive variation on top of small less useful membranes of skin could use this adaptation to survive a fall or to assist in jumping from tree to tree until they got better at gliding and slowly accumulating more mutations so that they could turn falling in style into actual flight. For the other tetrapods, the birds, these wings are more like lightweight arms covered in feathers. The lightweight bones come with being non-aquatic archosaurs. The feathers come with being dinosaurs. And tracing their lineage as best as we can, some of the more famous examples of what would actually be cousins and not direct ancestors would be Tyrannosaurus, Oviraptor, and several other fully feathered theropods but manirapors and velociraptors were even more like birds and even starting to get small enough to get more of a benefit from their wings than simply staying warm or incubating a clutch of eggs. Some of them could run up steep inclines and maybe even glide before more adaptions like the loss of a long reptilian tail, the fusing of their fingers, and losing the ability to lay multiple eggs at the same time continued to make them lighter as they also acquired further adaptions to their wings and powerful chest muscles (in neognathes) allowing them to fly for longer distances as other adaptions to their brains allowed them to navigate these long distances. The other modern branch of birds either couldn’t fly or wasn’t nearly as good at it so they mostly stuck to the ground growing larger in some cases, losing their wings, or both. 

For the eye, we have living examples of what would be intermediate forms as well as the more complex different varieties. Cephalopods and vertebrates both developed camera eyes but vertebrate eyes are wired backward as to create a blind spot that the brain has to accommodate for, quite well, without us knowing. Further adaptions may be the post orbital bar that became fused to the brain case, the cartilage creating the basis of an eye socket and three eyelids (the third one is just a vestige in humans but the enclosed eye socket sets us apart from several other animals like most carnivores). Before the camera eye, a more ancestral trait would be lacking the lens used for better focus or the lack of color sensitivity so that everything is black and white or shades of gray. The nautilus has eyes like this. They are round like ours but lack the lens covering them. This is still a benefit over having less focus where insects went a different way having several compound eyes instead. All of this likely started out with light sensitive proteins like in the eyespots of several single celled organisms before one of those intermediates from being just light sensitive cells is found in flat worms that have them set inside the equivalent of a funnel. Simple light sensitive proteins at first may not tell the organisms much more than what several plants use to grow towards suns light away from the shade or provide a signal for several protists to escape the light where they might get detected but subsequent adaptions provide these animals that have them the ability to see what they’re looking at. Related is how the line leading to mammals lost the pineal eye than lizards still have when they became warm blooded. Such an eye doesn’t help much in terms of vision and when you don’t need it for detecting certain warm wavelengths of light it can just go away. 

And for brain development there is a whole lot that can be said about it, but without getting into too many specifics it starts out as nothing more than a clustering of neurons before some of them like in worms start to provide some of the regulatory and sensory functions that come with more developed brains. Larger, more developed brains don’t just suddenly appear all at once but build upon this template adding whole new features or enlarging existing ones over time. Even a small increase provides a benefit until it starts to interfere with flight or survivability at child birth. It also generally grows larger in social groups and even larger in those who are already intelligent for problem solving and the calorie intake that comes with processing meat. However, in our case, there are also several genes that were “damaged” along the way that play a role. We lack the musculature of most non-human apes unless because of damaged genes and the emergence of regulatory genes that have duplicated at some time in the past. Part of this is responsible for our weak bite in comparison as well as our jaw muscles not being connected to a crest above our skulls that we no longer have or need. This allows our skulls to grow larger as a tumor suppressor gene being damaged not only makes us more susceptible to brain cancer but provides us with the 10% increase that sets us apart from the other apes that we use for higher order thinking skills which leads to technology when we also have dexterous hands no longer as strong as they are in other apes giving us fine motor skills. These two things working in tandem lead to increased brain mass over the other apes, especially once our ancestors started cooking food making it possible to absorb more calories with less effort. Why don’t the other animals have nearly as complex brains or display the same capacity for technology and abstract concepts? A lot of superficial changes and some rather noticeable ones occurred in our lineage that wasn’t found in theirs and each of these provided a survival benefit on their own (expect maybe the one that now results in more brain cancer) so that they would be selected for. We’re not as fast or as strong as other animals are but we can run for longer without getting tired, we don’t overheat as fast, and we have the dexterity necessary to develop intricate technologies. And because we are a social species the increased intelligence and comprehension and other things that come with having a larger brain allow us to develop larger social networks again creating another benefit for survival. Walking bipedally also helps with our ability to possess a large brain to body mass compared to those that walk on all fours because this method of walking, especially as it is in us, burns fewer calories and provides less neck strain than holding our necks out in front of us with a huge weight bearing down on our necks as we walk. 

Of course, there are also several problems that come with having each of these traits in the wrong environment or when it comes to survival just being born so that fish that live in the dark lost their eyes, birds that don’t fly have reduced wings or lack them entirely (or have a useless appendage in their place that takes less resources to make). And our brains cause a higher infant mortality rate even when they continue developing into adulthood or when the bones of our skulls remain detached until shortly birth so that social groups and technology plays a more vital role in our survival than is necessary for animals that only meet up to have sex.",1579903088

t3_etc8gl,OddJackdaw,"&gt; I'm talking about variation in individual animals within a single new generation.

No, radical changes are usually detrimental, so they tend to be selected against. 

&gt; I'm trying to understand, from a genuine evolutionary perspective, how the simple, minute tweaks associated with new structures would accumulate. It seems like they're not going to contribute to selection at all because all of the overwhelming force of the immediate utility associated with factors like size, sexual attractiveness, intelligence, etc.

Minor changes can either be neutral or benefit, and they will still get passed on. A trait that is neutral today may not be neutral in the future, so it is a misunderstanding to think that a change must have an immediate effect. 

&gt; it seems quite striking that we're not all beautiful, intelligent, smart, etc. Why? Well, those are the factors we have been selecting for in each other for a very very very long time.

While it is true that beautiful and intelligent people tend to reproduce *easier*, they don't necessarily reproduce *more*. The reality is that almost anyone who wants to reproduce has historically been able to reproduce.  A trait will only be weeded out of the gene pool if there is such a strong selective force that it seriously hurts the ability to reproduce, and neither unattractiveness or lack of intelligence seriously hinder a person's ability to attract a mate. If anything, it causes unattractive and dumb people to mate with each other which will make the traits even more likely to be passed on. And-- particularly in the modern era-- these people tend to have larger families.

&gt; The second objection that shift in environmental conditions will change the nature of the ""ideal specimen"" such that meaningful transformations in the ""practical invariants"" of a species (which you can relatively define as those things which remain almost identical from parent to child) will be selected for over and against immediate factors, that just seems non-empirical because things like speed, strength, intelligence, general symmetry, are meta-adaptations.

This paragraph isn't entirely clear, but again, you seem to be hung up on the idea of ""immediate factors."" Other than in genes that are so detrimental that you die or are physically unable to reproduce, ""immediate"" just isn't a thing in evolution. Any trait that is not so detrimental that it prevents you from reproducing has a decent likelihood of being passed on.",1579899755

At the end of the day, evolution is not abiogenesis irrespective of how you want to interpret a book title.   


&gt; Do you see it as a fact, that humans are more morally significant than animals?

Absolutely. It's part of my moral worldview which I don't extend to most animals, except my dog. Elevating humankind's morality and welling above that of other animals is in no way dishonest or has anything to do with evolution since evolution is not a moral claim.   


&gt;I guess if you must to be honest, ""no"" is also acceptable, but that would be a problematic response, because it would cause cognitive dissonance in your own mind, not to mention provide fodder for the key complaint of the Wedge Document authors.

Yikes, the only thing I've asked you is if you believe evolution is an origins claims. Modern evolutionary synthesis is not an origins claim. You might have mistaken me for another poster, but I'm happy to engage here.   


&gt;if you could agree that human life is valuable in a significant way, and could explain that persuasively by appealing to scientific naturalism and not religious dogma, that would take a lot of wind out of the sails of people writing and pushing that view. 

I'm not all sure why people want to conflate scientific fact with a moral system or why a scientific fact is suddenly more ""true"" if a moral component can be mapped onto it?   


It's quite easy to appeal to scientific naturalism for a moral system. So I'm still not quite sure what the issue here is.   


&gt; conspiracy to Literally Overthrow Science and usher in Theocratic Hegemony or not

&gt; because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people.    
  
&gt;  
&gt; I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes. 

That's actually not how it works. Blood perfusion to the brain is tightly controlled by barometric sensors in your carotid arteries and downstream affectors. Blood is never diverted from the brain to other organ systems as it  has the absolute highest priority for perfusion in the body. The brain will literally shunt blood away from your other organs and cause them to die before it disrupts its own blood supply. Vasoconstriction in the brain is met with hemodynamic  autoregulation responses which preserve perfusion over small ranges as the brain is extremely sensitive to changes in glucose/oxygen.   


Anyways, during sympathetic nervous system activation acetylcholine gets released at various innervated locations. Acetylcholine causes the adrenal medullas to release catecholamines. The catecholamines cause vasoconstriction at various unneeded anatomical sites like the GI tract, kidneys, and skin. That blood is then shunted to skeletal muscles, heart, and lungs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most of the literature I've read along those lines has more to do with managing knowledge workers, but the data is intuitive, and appears to be robustly supported by research, not only for knowledge workers but also even for people in literal physical combat 

This sounds pretty woo-woo Jordan-Peterson esque, what are you trying to say? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Fear and stress make you stupid and reduce your capacity for clear, effective rational thought. 

Maybe, but that's kind of the whole point of the SNS--get out/away/fight. It's not meant to be used to sit down and write math proofs. It causes hyperfocus on the task at hand, moving that attention to other non-imminent tasks isn't a priority. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat.  

SNS response is not a binary dichotonomy. It exists along a spectrum, is modulated by parasympathetic activity, and interacts with numerous endocrine axes to produce several degrees of response. SNS activation of ""I have a test in 3 weeks"" compared to ""I need to fight or die"" is different.  


&gt;  But it seems irrational to be so certain about your position but at the same time to be terrified or stressed by someone who wants to use academic research and argumentation to change peoples' minds about it. It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we? 

Anti-scientific doctrines are inherently dangerous and cause harm to humankind. Interacting in the world under a false-understanding of reality demonstrably confers harm to others. If you don't believe that is a worthy cause of trying to combat, perhaps your moral system is lacking. However, it is a free country (presumably you live in a relatively free country) and you are allowed to prioritize and harbor values as you see fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Do you feel like humans are generally bad and stupid, and like maybe the majority of humans require smarter people to force them to make good choices, sort of as their overlords or something?  

Not at all. There are very few people who are ""bad."" The problem is that good people are animated by bad ideas--which religion seems to have a near infinite supply of. All ideas should be met with skepticism and many ideas are privy to scientific inquiry. Science is a reliable way to determine truth. If someone wants to play scientist, they shouldn't expect anything less than a scientific treatment of their idea.

This

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686537](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686537) 

Is a review of viral mutation rates. They mutate, and Carter and Sanford did actually measure that, so that's probably worth a citation. No mention of entropy.

This

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556217](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556217)

Actually you have it backwards. The spanner causes the replication to go slower, and that has a side effect of helping the viruses spread in some cases.

That is their only function, and the faster they replicate the more efficiently that replication machinery is working.

But I was looking to see how scary it ought to be, and given the thesis in the intro and the fact that they cite research as fundamental to their plan, and explicitly argue against indoctrination of dogma, I am not finding a rational case for fear. If you believe that the best ideas won in an environment of free interchange of ideas, what is there to be afraid of?

Maybe people since 1998 have considered themselves nominally to be following the document but in practice contradicting the principles, but in my view, if you could correct them by appealing to the document they're following, then the problem is not in that document.

&gt;these guys are more into the culture war than dispassionately learning about the RealWorld we all live in.

Of course it's about ""the culture war"", that's in the very beginning of the doc... They see the devaluation of humanity to be a dangerous idea that they see as an inevitable conclusion of materialism, and promoting ID research is the weapon with which they want to fight against the devaluation of humanity.

You obviously don't think it's a valid strategy, but you do think devaluing human life is bad, right?

You didn't answer my question about whether it's a fact that humans are more morally significant than animals. Do you believe it?

It's not intended to be a trap question and I don't believe it's irrelevant either. If you don't like answering it in the affirmative because doing so might expose something you have in common with the ID movement, then to me, that seems like a departure from reason and from good ethics.

On the other hand, if you would answer no, doesn't that make you feel uncomfortable? Even if you might disagree with the strategy, I imagine you could still sympathize with the drive towards ideals in a way that replaces some fear with understanding.

IF it were part of the model, it would be part of the DFE chart. It's not. And even today, beneficial mutations and ""adaptive evolution"" lie OUTSIDE the model(s).

t1_ffev9k1,ursisterstoy,"Actually “mutation is a mechanism for common ancestry” would be about as dishonest as saying the atavisms aren’t really atavisms if they don’t have some specific trait. 

Mutation is the mechanism that creates diversity. No matter what kind of mutation. No matter if the result is conceptually good, bad, or neutral. We have examples of all three and I’ve even provided plenty of evidence for this myself. You’ve provided some yourself for this when discussing the mtDNA MRCA for specific clades you wanted to discuss as if they were completely isolated groups. A poodle and bulldog are quite different from each other because they possess different alleles of the same genes - mutation creates the diversity. Artificial selection, a process by which humans create breed, is a purification process selecting out which mutant varieties we want over which ones we don’t. By selecting specific traits we remove the other traits from the isolated gene pools we create in this fashion so that within these populations the diversity is less than if we consider the entire group like all domesticated gods, which are obviously all the same “kind” of animal. 

It is the patterns of mutation and selection found in genetics and in fossils that provide us with a clear evolutionary progression where we don’t have to watch every birth take place or produce every single mother of a mother to get a clear understanding that breeds of dogs originated from a few wolves. They’re still wolves, but now they are also domesticated dogs too. 

The higher levels of classification are created by the same process but the descendants living today have grown further apart with time. We can still trace this back anyway with a couple stumbling blocks in certain cases - not because no link exists, but because a few different intermediate forms could all fit as the actual intermediate and they all are living at the same time as cousins to each other.

t3_esr9ns,azusfan,"Several have criticised me for suggesting the Lenski study was referred to by common ancestry believers, as evidence of common ancestry.  Rather than reply to each, I'll do it once, here.

1. Several people, in previous threads, have referenced this as evidence of common ancestry. It was the reason i posted the review.  This study was referenced in the immediately previous thread on natural selection, and was why i quoted my review in this thread.
2. Other subsequent studies have overtly made a claim of 'speciation!', which Lenski himself disputed.  This is also quoted in my review:

""The claim of 'new speciation!', is only an arbitrary definition, not anything compelled by any changes in the morphology or genetic structure of the organism. To claim this is 'real evolution!' is absurd. It is obviously just adaptation, &amp; only demonstrates the viability &amp; adaptability of this particular organism. Some organisms do NOT have this capability, but die under unfriendly conditions. So this phenomenon does not apply universally, as would be expected if this were a mechanism for macro evolution, but is unique to e.coli. 

*Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit+ as a ""speciation event"" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said ""that becoming Cit+ was only a first step on the road to possible speciation"", and thus did not propose that the Cit+ mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution*

So the claim of 'new speciation!' is not even claimed by Lenski, the one doing the study, even though hordes of eager Believers cling to it as 'scientific proof!' of common descent.""

3. If 'nobody claims that!' was true, why would Lenski rebut that claim?  Obviously, some do.  My statement stands and is accurate.

It's okay to say yes there.

I guess if you must to be honest, ""no"" is also acceptable, but that would be a problematic response, because it would cause cognitive dissonance in your own mind, not to mention provide fodder for the key complaint of the Wedge Document authors.

There's plenty--so much--to disagree with in the position of their document, but it strikes me that, if you could agree that human life is valuable in a significant way, and could explain that persuasively by appealing to scientific naturalism and not religious dogma, that would take a lot of wind out of the sails of people writing and pushing that view. 

Also interested in your thoughtful consideration of the other idea -- that whether it's a secret ""Christian Taliban"" conspiracy to Literally Overthrow Science and usher in Theocratic Hegemony or not, doesn't mean that it's not best responded to with a fully-engaged mind.

Insults and ego-trips come from a place of insecurity, and they interfere with clear thought, because a scared-brain triggers vasoconstriction in your frontal lobe, pumping precious resources away from higher reasoning into major muscle groups like legs for running and arms for hitting people. I mean -- your flair says that you're studying medicine, so correct me if you've seen anything different in your classes.

Most of the literature I've read along those lines has more to do with managing knowledge workers, but the data is intuitive, and appears to be robustly supported by research, not only for knowledge workers but also even for people in literal physical combat: Fear and stress make you stupid and reduce your capacity for clear, effective rational thought.

Fear and stress, then, are best avoided, or at least aggressively, intentionally managed, even when dealing with an enemy that is a rationally credible threat. But it seems irrational to be so certain about your position but at the same time to be terrified or stressed by someone who wants to use academic research and argumentation to change peoples' minds about it. It's a free country, there's a free press, and in the free interchange of ideas, we're all confident the better idea will win, aren't we?

Oh, or maybe that goes back to the ""human life"" thing.

t1_ffeh4ix,ursisterstoy,"Extensions of the tail bone? 

Actually in a paper I found from 1962 that was still trying to charge people to read it, I saw a mention of the second known reported tail atavism saying that there wasn’t an extension of the spine in that case in the abstract. I’m not sure how reliable this is so I didn’t include it. 


https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/atavism-embryology-development-and-evolution-843/


https://creation.com/human-tails - this link is intentionally misleading. Nobody said that all human tail atavisms are “fully functional.” Why would they be? Genes turned back on so that the coccyx doesn’t remain short and fused just makes it so that the tails we still have look like tails are still atavisms or evidence of a time when our ancestors still had relatively useless tails. It would take even more mutations to acquire the even older trait of the tail being useful. This is like how dolphins born with their anal fins counts as an atavism of a time when their ancestors still had them, but we don’t except nor do we find dolphins with four fully functional legs complete with feet for walking. 

An atavism is evidence that the genes exist to produce lost ancestral traits that shouldn’t exist at all if there was no evolutionary relationship. It is just one small piece of the puzzle in the big picture.",1579858958

I guess it depends on how you define ""create"" and ""new"". 

My understanding is that there are two basic types of mutations: mutations that happen in place either spontaneously or due to environmental effects, and ones that happen during replication. The OP's example ignored the second category altogether. His analogy ""This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'"" is clearly referring to mutations that occur within an existing gene. It would be fair to say it results in a ""new gene sequence"" but is the gene itself new? 

Really, whether it is ""new"" or not is a semantic distinction. I can see the point you are making, and I wouldn't say you are wrong, but you aren't really saying the same thing the OP is.

You're half-right.  It would be a fallacy if I claimed you were doing such things and then refused to back it up, and I can't really blame you for being on the defensive about such.  But what I actually did was predict what points others would raise against you.  And indeed, we can see replies to that effect; /u/Sweary_Biochemist and /u/OddJackdaw have pointed out that no one is holding up Prof. Lenski's work as proving common descent, both of them and /u/ThurneysenHavets and /u/TheBlackCat13 pointed out flaws in your understanding of mutation (as have I and folks responding here, but we'll get to that), and at the same time at least two of them pointed out that we know that new genes forming is a thing - which is, as it so happens, what my post above was also on about using a particular example.

But that's really an aside.  To the meat of it:

&gt;The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.

And the _inability_ of any bacteria to digest nylon byproducts, including the bacteria that evolved under laboratory conditions to do so, is quite well-documented.

&gt;It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions. There is no structural changes to the genome.

How does a bacterium produce new enzymes without changes to its genome?

&gt;It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

To the contrary; these enzymes are proteins translated from RNA transcribed from the DNA of the bacterial genome.  The fact that the parental bacteria didn't have enzymes for this and their dependents do is a change in the genome.  Such a change in the genome between generations is practically the definition of a mutation.

&gt; But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria. Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.

__How?__  I want you to be explicit here; if you are _only_ going to answer one part of my post, if you do not have the time or patience, please, _please_ address this section: ___How_, outside of mutation, do you propose bacteria with enzymes that digest nylon got them if not by mutation?  What is the ""more credible explanation"" you refer to?__

&gt; It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

Speciation in bacteria is something of a toss-up.  

I would agree entirely that it's a stretch to say such things show common ancestry - which is why no one's making that claim, and I'd prefer it if you did not bear false witness about us in that manner, if you please.

As to gene creation, it is not merely that they secrete the enzymes.  Those enzymes themselves are not present in their relatives; the genes those enzymes are produced from are simply not present.  Again, in the case of the strain evolved in the lab, we can say with certainty that their ancestor did not posses it because _we still have their frozen ancestors from the start of the experiment_.  

---

&gt;It is not a mechanism for common ancestry.

It is one of several that play a part, actually.

&gt; Mutation is an entropic process, that degrades an organism.

No, that is not demonstrated and in fact we have numerous examples of beneficial mutations - including the aforementioned genes that allow for digesting nylon byproducts.

&gt; It does not increase complexity, ...

Mutations include gene duplications, which can and does result in there being multiple copies of a gene that then can mutate independently to give rise to two different genes in the same gene family where once was one.  Having two related genes rather than one gene is, by any definition, more complex.

&gt; ... or create new genes, ...

The just-mentioned process above, among others, can and does observably give rise to novel genes that were not possessed by an organism's ancestors.

This is more egregious projection than Devin Nunes. My position remains the same, but I have been addressing the various and variable flimsy counter arguments you've been clumsily attempting to hurl at me. It seemed the polite thing to do. 

If I take the time to explain Kimura's model to you (and it is tragic that this is necessary), that does not mean I endorse it. Meanwhile you apparently *do*, yet don't actually even understand it. It was published in 1979, Paul: you've had long enough.

In contrast, no evidence for genetic entropy has ever been presented. Your ""much"" evidence is...lacking, while your excuses as to why ""populations that absolutely SHOULD exhibit genetic entropy mysteriously but reliably fail to do so"" continue to grow in self-contradictory spirals. Mice, even laboratory mice kept in optimal conditions and fed ad lib, where selective pressure is basically zero (a great analogy for humans) fail to show any sign of any 'entropic mutational accumulation'. They *drift*, sure, but they absolutely thrive as they do so. They have about half the mutations per generation we do, but can have five generations a year (and in the lab, they do). If GE actually existed, we'd see it pretty fast. The fact we don't suggests it's either so slow that actual speciation will render it irrelevant, or it isn't actually a thing. Either outcome invalidates a young, created human species (along with literally all the other evidence that clearly invalidates a young, created human species).

First we know, thanks to examinations of preserved and exhumed samples that the 1917 virus was no more virulent then any other flu outbreak. What cause nearly all the deaths in 1917 were bacterial infections. And penicillin and other antibodies wouldn't be available for another decade.

It's also misleading to say that mortality rates dropped in a smooth and gradual manner. H1N1 isn't persistent in human populations, so we are only really working with 4 data points over the last century. So advances in medical tech wouldn't show up until the next outbreak decades later. Paul and Sanford try and say that because we don't see a precipitous drop in mortality rates say during the 30's with the invention of antibiotics that indicates the drop is due to genetic entropy. While the obvious truth is that the reason we don't see said drop that corresponds to better medical tech is because there wasn't a H1N1 outbreak until 1957.

It is also worth noting that Paul's continued assertion the H1N1 is extinct is really undercut by its continued existence. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/burden-of-h1n1.html why he persists in saying that is bewildering.

I'm sure that the flu would not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be, had WWI not taken place. Surely there's little doubt that it did exacerbate things.

t1_ffb9m97,Hypersapien,"You see, what your problem is, is that you think a ""species"" is this strictly defined thing with hard edges. It's not. A species is an abstraction that humans came up with to classify things. Granted that it's less of an abstraction than other taxonomic classifications in that it actually has something in biology that you can observe to define it. If two organisms are capable of producing an offspring which is, itself, capable of breeding, then they're the same species. When we see something that we can call a species, we give it a name.

The simple fact is that nature, especially biology, is too messy to perfectly fit into our neat little human-made categories. Read up on ""[ring species](https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/a-z/Ring_species.asp)"" to see what I'm talking about.

Another thing that you don't seem to understand is that the idea of separate and distinct species means nothing when you're talking about a line of ancestry, since a genotype is constantly changing through the generations. The idea of different species only really means anything when you're looking at different populations in the same time period.",1579810774

I wasn't talking about the luxury of staying home, more so a sickness that's so awful you really don't have an option. Have you ever had norovirus? I have. Not a fun time. 

Granted we have more personal space now than for a good chunk of history (especially during the industrial revolution), but I actually don't know how far back into history those cramped conditions extend. It may be true further back for places like Europe, especially in the winter, but globally I'm not so sure. If you have any figures on like, population density throughout time, that'd be helpful. 

Then there's the issue of H1N1 being a zootonic(?) virus (I may have butchered the word), which behave differently in us than their usual hosts. Things like colds seem to do so well because they're both tuned for humans, and also don't do much to impair their host. The worst cold I ever had actually drove me to go out in public to look for symptom relief. I don't think many violent flu strains can do the same. But then again I'm not a virologist.

t3_ess5i9,ursisterstoy,"Tetrapods are defined as having four limbs but snakes don’t have any legs anymore. Synapsids are defined as having a couple holes in their head that humans no longer have. Most mammals have hair, but we have hairless cats and whales that are still mammals. 

A gain of a trait or a loss of an ancestral one happens often enough to develop an evolutionary family tree. It is like those nested dolls where the most distant ancestral clades contain each of the next most recent clades that contain the next most recent clades. Humans still have the majority of these defining characteristics of each of their clades but some traits along the way were lost. Sometimes we even find transitions for some of the steps along the way. Sometimes the in between forms don’t fossilize but we can still compare genetic similarities since we also know how mutations raise biodiversity that can be selected for in sub populations differently when they occupy different niches or when the mutation appears after the split from the other members of any particular clade. 

We are eukaryotes, scotokaryotes, neokaryotes because of how our cells are arranged and the organelles contained not found in other groups. Our lack of chloroplasts is another trait that separates us from what would become plants but our similarities with plants shows that the common ancestor of both also lacked the chloroplasts that are a defining characteristic of the divergent lineage. 

Each descendant clade that follows provides us a basic overview of how the earliest cells gave rise to humans and the sister clades in each case help to explain the biodiversity that arose via this process. We are monkeys (simians) but often times people won’t admit this when they only consider a couple living types of Old World monkeys as monkeys along with all the New World Monkeys. Apes are a sister clade to what everyone will accept as Old World Monkeys (Cercopithecidae and colobus monkeys). Within this group we have great apes and lesser apes to distinguish between the subset of apes that diverged to give rise to gibbons and siamangs as our lineage continued down the path of Oranguntans, Gorillas, Chimpanzees and Humans. We are still great apes. Homininae contains all of these except Orangutans among what is still alive. Hominini contains chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans as well as several extinct forms and we’re all more than 98% similar genetically when considering our coding genes and around 96% identical when comparing the entire genome which only makes sense because we are all the same type of animal. The next more recent clade excludes chimpanzees and bonobos, but himinina includes Graecopithecus, Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and Homo. This is also probably the order that these take us from the human-chimp common ancestor to our genus. The next step is our species but technically we’d still be a population Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo rhodesiensis as well, despite the “you can’t outgrow your ancestry” usually applying to the higher clades more specifically. 

The entire time, a sub population the origin of each clade splits off from the original group. This tends to start out more along the lines of ethnic group, leading to a breed, to a subspecies, and so forth before the isolated group is no longer inter-fertile or able to inter-breed at all and then the clades get more defined as they drift apart genetically when they can no longer mix back together. This is why you can’t outgrow your ancestry. You are a descendant of the original population of every ancestral clade and you’ll continue to be a descendant no matter how different you have become or how ever many descendant populations arise from the current one many years into the future. 

A half man-half ape? Look in the mirror. All humans are still apes.

&gt;And if you don't think 2009 was Spanish flu explain why Sanford felt they were similar enough to compare, but the virus that existed afterwards wasn't.

Again, if you read their paper you'd know. The Swine Flu was a variant that was originally related to the 1917 Spanish flu lineage that went extinct (in humans) in the 1950s, but apparently jumped to swine and then back to humans again in 2009. The fact that it was associated with relatively low mortality in 2009 is explained by the high mutational load:

&gt;Nearest neighbor calculations (data not shown) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage. They cluster tightly with the 2009–2010 outbreak porcine viruses, all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses. Thus, we included the 2009–2010 viruses and the nine isolated, non-outbreak viruses in the “porcine” category. In this same figure, we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after (Figure ​(Figure2,2, circle) fall directly on the trajectory of the non-frozen lineage. This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re-introduction virus. Kedwaii, et al.[8] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses, an H1N2 and an H1N1, from different continents, but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve. Regardless, general attenuation due to genome-wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [54-56] associated with the 2009 pandemic. The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1,889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain.",1579809738

&gt;Feathered dinosaur ancestors” Sinosauropteryx and Caudipteryx are “dated” at 125 Ma (million years old) While confuciusornis was dated 127 Ma.

[While Sinosauropteryx had feather-like structures, it was not very closely related to the previous ""first bird"" Archaeopteryx.[1] There are many dinosaur clades that were more closely related to Archaeopteryx than Sinosauropteryx was, including the deinonychosaurians, the oviraptorosaurians, and the therizinosauroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx#Feathers). This is entirely consistent with the theory that modern birds are descended from the same lineage that gave us Velociraptor. 

Caudipteryx' classification is controversial to the point it's a fool's errand to use it as evidence for or against dino-bird evolution. 

Confuciusornis is many things, but it's decidedly not a modern bird given that Hesperornis and Ichthyornis are more closely related to those than Confuciusornis is.

Funny how we don't find thyreophoran fossils in Triassic rocks. It's also funny how T. rex only appears in strata that are dated to the Cretaceous period.

From the document:
&gt;&gt;Phase I is the essential component of everything that comes afterward. Without solid scholarship, research and argument, the project would be just another attempt to indoctrinate instead of persuade.

It looks like it is not interested in overturning materialism with dogmatic indoctrination, but rather with scienctific inquiry.

Are you concerned that this might happen? If you are not, you have no need to fear it, do you? And if you are concerned that scienctific inquiry might overturn materialism, isn't that position itself dogmatic and anti-science? Why not just look at the evidence and see if it does?

The emotional investment many  people put into the argument doesn't feel like a fundamentally rational position. It feels like fear and identity and tribalism and a lot of things that add up to bias.

What would arguments look like if we engaged without feeling threatened? I cannot help but think they would improve in clarity, and offer us more opportunities to learn, refine, and persuade others than the typical near-seething combative engagement of one whowe existence is threatened.

Maybe fight-or-flight was useful to our ancestors, but psychologically safe, inquisitive courage is what got us most of the intellectual progress we value today, isn't it? Why go back to rage-debate when dealing with something so important if we don't have some part of us that feels it is genuinely at risk?

&gt;point of the ID movement is to replace scientific materialism, root and branch, with ""theistic understanding""s.

I'm reading that doc rather differently. To me, it looks like the goal is not to replace science with theology, but to stake out a way for science and scienctific progress to be compatible with the idea that it is a fact that humans are more morally significant than mere animals.

&gt; This is totally, completely wrong. Kimura did not even so much as attempt to model this. He only asserted it without providing any evidence. It lies outside the scope of his model completely, as you can see by the fact that his DFE doesn't even bother to include beneficial ones.

I'm sorry to jump in here, but this is so egregious I have to comment. 

Have you read the actual paper from Kimura that you're talking about? The one where he says that he excluded beneficial mutations, and his rationale for doing so?

Lemme pull it up real quick:

&gt;The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.

So there are four options here.

This is totally, completely wrong. Kimura did not even so much as attempt to model this. He only asserted it without providing any evidence. It lies outside the scope of his model completely, as you can see by the fact that his DFE doesn't even bother to include beneficial ones.

But you see, you're having to change your story on the fly, because originally you wanted to say that there is no decline due to neutrals; but what you actually have to claim is that there is a decline but it is offset by beneficial.

Synonymous mutations do not alter coding sequence. And we use synonymous mutations to asses the consequence of NON synonymous mutations: that is how we know that non-synonymous changes, (i.e. actual alterations) are more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

As for Kimura, first it's a model, secondly he openly states that if beneficial mutations (things we know exist) are allowed in his model, they fix incredibly fast and evolution goes wild, and thirdly his model is built on the assumption (note, not observed fact) that 'mutations are slightly deleterious but effectively neutral', and may lead to a decline in fitness (in his model) of 10\^-7 per generation.

H1N1 isn't. It was last years dominant flu strain. The ""extinction"" in 1917 is readily explained by herd immunity due to its widespread infection in previous years. If, hypothetically a 1/3 of people had some immunity you wouldn't/couldn't get an outbreak until enough new, not immune people had been born to bring the herd immunity below 20%, probably much lower.

t1_ffbnted,EyeProtectionIsSexy,"&gt; I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene. It is not a mechanism for trait creation.

Yeah, evolution works by modifying what already exists. But what we have here is a duplication event. This is literally the op And when we're talking about mutations in the structure, even a single mutation can cause drastic structural changes in protein folding, leading what literally a new protein that can perform a wide range of potential biochemical tasks.

&gt; ..this is believed, or hypothesized. The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures. There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt.  selection acts upon existing variability

Before we continue  down this trail, let's lay a couple of things of down so I know how to address you. It doesn't seem that you know what a gene is. 
Do you agree that;

1) Mutations occur in a variety of formats, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, inversions, deletions, duplications, all of which can either remove, modify or add nucleotide base pairs to an already existing template. 

2) Heritability occurs. 

Additionally, what exactly is a gene to you? Is a sequence of nucletides that have a start codon upstream and a stop codon downstream? Does a gene actually need to code for anything usefull? Does a gene always need to code for something? I'd really like to hammer down a precise definition of what a gene is at the molecular level. This will be helpful to make sure we're on the same page.

&gt; Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity. Diversity decreases via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves' mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry.

What do you mean by complexity? Would you mind giving me, not a real world example, but just a test example with the following sequence. I want to visualize what you're talking about:

AUGAGCTAGCTATCGATTAGTCGATGACGTAGTCGACGTACGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGTAGATACGCTCGCTACGTACGACTGACUAG

Now onto Lynch:

&gt; The fraction of amino-acid altering mutations that is deleterious enough to be removed by selection is approximated by C= 1-Kn/Ks, where Kn and Ks are the substitution rates at nonsynonomous and synonymous sites, respectively. If mutations are neutral on average, C, the proportion of ‘‘missing’’ amino-acid substitutions, would have an expected value of 0.0. However, in all taxa examined so far, average values of C are in excess of 0.7 (e.g., Ohta 1995; Eyre-Walkeret al. 2002), implying that the majority of amino-acid altering mutations are deleterious. 

So, take home messages here:

Most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious.

Well, yes.

And we can TELL most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious, BECAUSE THEY ARE SELECTED AGAINST.

And we can tell they are selected against, by comparing them to mutations that DO NOT alter amino acids.

Do you begin to see the problem? If all mutations were deleterious, we could not use C analysis. C is zero when *no* mutations are deleterious, or when *all* mutations are deleterious. C is not zero. 

Essentially, the Lynch position is that if a mutation ISN'T synonymous, then it probably does something. And that thing is more likely to be bad than good. This tells us nothing about synonymous mutations (other than they clearly accumulate more rapidly than nonsynonymous ones do), and tells us even less about mutations in regions that don't even code for anything.

Also, if you read the paper, it notes that generally ""mean"" fitness declines in MA experiments (as would be expected: most mutations that alter amino acids are deleterious), but that individual line fitness *can* increase. MA experiments are conducted without selection pressure (that's sort of the point), and employ horrendous bottlenecking: if you add selection for fitness to this equation, it's pretty easy to see that in the wild less fit lines would be outcompeted by more fit lines.

Sure, but the flu pandemic was not limited to people fighting in WWI. That's hardly a sufficient explanation for the data. And it doesn't account for the extinction of the strain (either time).

Yes.

t3_ess5i9,andrewjoslin,"Great question!  Others here have pointed you toward cladistics, and that's exactly the thing you're asking about:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) .

The concept of ""clades"" and the subsequent study of ""cladistics"" came about because the classical Linnaean taxonomy -- kingdom, phylum, ..., genus, species -- is very well suited to placing a limited number of species in a nested hierarchy based on shared morphology, but not good at all for placing huge numbers of species in a hierarchy based on their ancestry.  This is because Linnaean taxonomy was developed before the theory of evolution, so it was not designed to include all the relationships needed to represent Universal Common Ancestry (UCA), nor all the species we now know about.  It makes the most sense to classify organisms based on ancestry, because that is primarily what determines all the other characteristics of the organism anyway (including morphology).

I was educated in the US, and we learned Linnaean taxonomy all the way up through high school.  When I learned about cladistics *at age 33 (!!!)* I was absolutely *floored*.  It immediately became obvious that *every clade represents a population of organisms that actually lived at some time*, whereas under Linnaean taxonomy it would be hard to argue that there was once a basal ""animal"" that started Kingdom Animalia.  Once I realized that, all of cladistics made sense:  it's a family tree full of ancestral organisms, rather than a bunch of bins that we categorize organisms into.

Check this out:   [https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/](https://phylogenyexplorerproject.com/) .

It's a cladistic phylogeny explorer managed by Aron Ra.  Though many clades are uncertain or unnamed because science doesn't know enough about them, you'll quickly see that the ""web of life"" can't possibly be shoved into the Linnaean system without losing basically *all* information about common ancestry.  I challenge you to navigate all the way to Homo sapiens in that explorer :)",1579796223

t1_ffbwd18,GuyInAChair,"&gt;Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.

The 2009 strain was available for testing, and they didn't do it. It started off as extremely variant and declined over the course of a number of years. In that case they had an almost day by day sample library to draw from yet choose not to do a single fitness test. Its bewildering how someone can make the conclusion they did without doing a single test, when all the materials necessary for them to do them were easily available.

&gt;They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased.

No they simply assumed that, and came to their conclusion by ignoring other things that effect mortality. And yes they did ignore it, acknowledging that they exist isn't the same as factoring them into their model. We have rates of infection of H1N1 going back to the 1840's https://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/8107 and of course the data gets much better in the 20th century. Calculating herd immunity and infection rates is something that is easily doable by them and they simply didn't. That's ignoring data even if they acknowledge that it exists.

&gt;Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? 

Because H1N1 hadn't been seen in the world for 60+ years in 1917. No H1Nx strain had been seen for 40 years. Combine a population with no immunity at all, mobilize them for war in poor sanitary conditions no antibiotics, little to no knowledge of outbreak containment and you have a recipe for the disaster it became. Of course huge numbers of people contracted bacterial infections, millions of people were in close contact in the trenches, field hospitals, makeshift wards etc. 

There's also reasons why in parts of the world not as effected by the war the outbreak wasn't any worse then a typical bad fue season. Heck if you were over 65 in 1917 the worst pandemic in recent times wouldn't even qualify as a mild flu season.

&gt;if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1... ...I answered this here.

So there exists a way for a virus to increase in fitness. Lacking any knowledge of the future how in the friggen world can one make a determination about genetic entropy within a such a small snapshot in time? Considering H1N1 existed before 1917, exists currently, there seems to be absolutely no reason to pick the dates they did except to come to the conclusion they want.

&gt;Also addressed in the paper:

&gt;Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality

t1_ffbwkgl,Lockjaw_Puffin,"&gt;So you couldn't find even one? I bet you tried

I actually didn't, because I did my homework and know that it's next to impossible to find an unbroken fossil lineage since there's numerous factors preventing that from occurring. You should ask u/DarwinZDF42 or u/Capercaillie, they're both scientists (geneticist and vertebrate zoologist respectively) and they can corroborate what I just told you. 

&gt;According to the evolutionary timescale there shouldn't be any! 

According to *basic rules of biology and geography*, it would be nearly impossible. The evolutionary timescale has almost nothing to do with it. 

&gt;Fossilisation doesn't just happen

Not at all what I said, but keep strawmanning me if you want. The more people here who see your dishonesty, the better. 

&gt;wonder why we actually find so many? 

Because the number of individual organisms guaranteed that some of them would be fossilized. There is also the fact that certain environments (e.g. mountainous regions, metamorphic rock, etc) are simply [not conducive to fossilisation](https://www.americangeosciences.org/education/k5geosource/content/fossils/under-what-conditions-do-fossils-form). 

&gt;A great big flood?

Let me give you an idea of *exactly* how stupid it is to think that a global flood could possibly provide us with the fossil record as we see it.

Creationists tend to invoke three flood-sorting mechanisms to explain the ordering of the fossil record. Each one is different, and each one is utter nonsense.

**Ecological zonation**: Patterns of fossil deposition in Noah's Flood can be explained as follows - The lower strata, in general, would contain animals that lived in the lower elevations. Thus, marine invertebrates would be buried first, then fish, then amphibians and reptiles (who live at the boundaries of land and water), and finally mammals and birds. Also, animals would be found buried with other animals from the same communities.

Problem 1: Whales, despite living in the same ecological strata as fish, aren't found anywhere at the bottom of the geological column. The same goes for mosasaurs like Tylosaurus

Problem 2: Modern mammal fossils aren't found anywhere alongside dinosaur fossils.

Problem 3: Birds are very much alive today, but pterosaurs aren't. Excluding the giants like Q, most pterosaurs occupied the same ecological niche as seagulls and passerines (songbirds) - Pteranodon is the most familiar fish-eating flyer to the public, and there's good reason to think small flyers like Anurognathus were insectivorous. Creationists have so far been remarkably quiet as to why this is the case.

**Hydrologic sorting** = The order of fossils deposited by Noah's Flood can be explained like so - Fossils of the same size will be sorted together. Heavier and more streamlined forms will be found at lower levels.

Cherry-picking at best, outright bullshit at worst. Massive creatures like Dunkleosteus are found in the earlier rock strata of the Devonian, but the actual titans of prehistory make their first appearances in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. And the heaviest animal on Earth, Big Blue has never been found in the rock record until long after the dinosaurs died off.

There's also **differential escape**, where smaller and faster creatures are discovered at higher positions in the geological column while bigger, slower beasts would have died and been buried at lower locales. Of course, this explanation implies that leviathans like Patagotitan ran faster than smaller creatures like Allosaurus and Dryosaurus.

&gt;Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_birds

&gt;This is essentially correct. The fact we cannot do this means that there may NOT be an 'original

Wrong. Mistakes don't build encyclopedias, but they do damage them. Thus the fact that there was at some point an original encyclopedia is not in question.

&gt;I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, if humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

Now, on to YEC timelines, human evolution and the 'original genome'.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us imagine an encyclopedia that is 3 billion characters in length, written only in G, A, T and C.

I give you 7 billion copies, each of which has 25,000 random mistakes which they have acquired by being repeatedly copied *slightly* badly, 250 times.

Can you determine the original text of the encyclopedia with enormous confidence? Yes.

Each encyclopedia is ALREADY 99.999% correct, so that's a fantastic start.

Line them all up and look for the consensus characters at any query sites: job done.

Bonus points, because the mistakes are inherited (copies of copies of copies) you can also sort the encyclopedias into trees of relatedness which allow you to address any ambiguities that might need clarification. Any bottlenecks in the copying process will also jump out incredibly clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

If instead, you cannot do this (and you can't, because it turns out there are WAAAAAAAY more random mistakes than expected), it is telling us something important: as you said, 

&gt;  if you take an encyclopedia and copy it lots of times with mistakes each time and you destroy all the old copies such that we only have the current corrupted copy, it will get to a point where you will not be able to reliably reconstruct the original 

This is essentially correct. The fact we cannot do this means that there may NOT be an 'original' (there may have been several, and they themselves may have been copied from something else), and also, that an *awful lot of time has elapsed* since the earliest encyclopedias were transcribed.

&amp;#x200B;

And this latter scenario is exactly what we see. 

I need to stress this very clearly, Paul: the mutation rate we observe in humans is nowhere NEAR sufficient to give the diversity of human haplotypes we observe today, *if* humans have only existed for 6000 years, and have (allegedly) undergone an 8-person bottleneck 4500 years ago.

The latter proposal (that humans are 6000 years old and suffered a bottleneck of 8 people 4500 years ago) is incredibly easy to test with the genetic data we have already (and have had for years). And the data absolutely does *not* support this proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

I also would caution against proposing that mutation rates may have changed over time, because your current position requires '100 per generation' to be so high that genetic entropy exists (even if we can't see it). Mutation rates sufficient to establish extant diversity in a mere *4500/6000* years would be huge, and would absolutely be deleterious, and we wouldn't be here.",1579792721

For actual evolutionary biology, this isn't a problem, because evolutionary biology doesn't propose that created, perfect genes exist or ever have existed. For creation it is *very* problematic: your position requires the human species to have been created with one (or perhaps two, depending on clonal creation of eve) genomes, and to have undergone only 100-250 generations, including a massive bottleneck down to 8 people at one stage.

Show support for this. You claim things have been written on this, but thus far I've seen nothing beyond your own self-citations of creationist websites, and the Carter/Sanford paper which doesn't show this at all.

I would need to know 

A) how you determine the 'initial' genotype, and how do you determine whether that represents an optimum

B) how you measure this 'cumulative fitness impact' of neutral mutations, mutations which are (by definition) not ones that impact fitness.

C) how, if this 'cumulative fitness impact' exists and is deleterious, it is not selected against.

D) why we see no sign of this 'cumulative fitness impact' in any wild populations (we can't demonstrate it in the lab, either, unless we use mutator strains, and then it's due to cumulative deleterious mutations rather than neutral ones, which rather defeats the point)

You appear to be viewing your own misunderstandings as a strength, and your lack of formal education as a badge of pride. It...really isn't.

Not sure what you mean with this, and you didn't cite a source for your claim. But it is known that mutations outside the coding region are more likely to be nearly neutral than those inside the coding region (Eyre-Walker &amp; Keightley 2007). And it is also known that higher level multicellular life forms have a much smaller percentage of their genomes dedicated to protein-coding. Voila! Higher percentage of nearly neutral mutations, which means less effective selection.  


&gt; Yep. And the deleterious ones are selected against, the favourable ones are selected for, and the neutral ones allow drift. Voila: equilibrium. 

Wrong. That's not equilibrium, because the 'neutral ones' are only effectively neutral, not strictly neutral. They are in fact very slightly deleterious.

We can now clearly show that hagfish retain all the associated features of vertebrates, and the genetics supports this ancestry too (they have the relevant vertebrae-associated genes, but just don't use them for that) so we have the tools to distinguish clades with secondary loss of traits from more distantly related clades that never had those traits.

t1_ffayrzg,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Sanford and co didn't actually do any other fitness tests, specifically the one you describe. By what metric do you gauge reproductive success, since the method you specifically mention aasnt measured?

Well, for one thing the Spanish Flu strain they're talking about is extinct so no lab testing is even theoretically possible to begin with.   


For another thing, their argument is based upon comparing the death statistics over time (which would correspond to the virulence of the strain). Virulence would correspond to the level of function of the virus--it's ability to replicate itself.  


They showed that as mutational load increased, the mortality(virulence) decreased. That supports the predictions of GE, since it shows that mutations damage function.  


&gt;Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Why do you think those people were dying of pneumonia? They just happened to get really unlucky and get pneumonia right after getting the flu? Why did that phenomenon decrease as mutations in the flu increased?  


&gt; Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.   


No, they did not ignore that. They addressed it in the paper:  


**There have been major medical advances since 1918, and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1-related mortalities. Therefore, the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. However, while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918, such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world. Second, the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve, while medical advances have occurred in bursts (e.g., the breakthrough in antibiotics, and the more recent development of antivirals). Third, each of the great influenza pandemics (1918, 1956, 1968) involved the emergence of a new viral strain, which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe. This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance. Finally, the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1-related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.**   


&gt; if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago? 

I answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/esjgk4/ignorant_virus_headline_fail_virus_is_mutating/ffbv66f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year? 

I don't think you're referring to the same strain they are, which did first surface in the '17 pandemic:  


 **The H1N1 influenza A virus has been circulating in the human population for over 95 years, first manifesting itself in the pandemic of 1917–1918. Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. (From Background section)**  


&gt; does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance? 

Also addressed in the paper:  


**Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain.**",1579784948

This means that all dinosaurs already had avian respiration before some of them gave rise to birds, just like most all theropod dinosaurs already had feathers, and just like velociraptor already had the beginnings of what would become wings. The more recent transitions could fly better, would have their fingers fuse together, would lose their long tail, and would lose their teeth.

t3_ess5i9,DarwinZDF42,"Yes, there are examples. I'll provide one and explain how it works. 

Consider ""tetrapods"". ""Tetrapods"" refers to terrestrial vertebrates - amphibians, reptiles (including birds), and mammals - so named because they, or we, all have four limbs - tetra = 4, pod = leg/foot.

Snakes do not have four limbs. Snakes do not have any limbs. But they are tetrapods. 

How?

Because the groupings are based not on morphology, but on common ancestry. When we classify something as a ""tetrapod"", we're saying ""it shares a tetrapod common ancestor with all other tetrapods"", *not* ""it has four limbs"". 

So we can identify the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all tetrapods, the ancestral tetrapod from which all other tetrapods are descended. Anything descended from that MRCA is a tetrapod, even if it subsequently loses its limbs, as snakes have.

&gt;Where did the ability come from? You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this wasn't.

So you believe.  So you assume.  The adaptation of bacterua to digest a variety of materials is well documented.   Is this proof of speciation?  Common ancestry?  Gene creation?  No.  It is an adaptive process, by which a specific bacteria ADAPTS to changing conditions.  There is no structural changes to the genome.  The bacteria is not 'becoming!' another organism, or transitioning to a cockroach.

It is not clearly proved that mutation is even responsible for this adaptive ability. That is presumed, to prop up the belief.

You can believe it was 'mutation!', if you wish.  But there are other, more credible explanations for adaptability among bacteria.  Concocting enzymes is what bacteria do.  It is a stretch to conclude, 'Speciation!', 'Common Ancestry!', and/or 'Gene Creation!', based on the ability of bacteria to secrete dissolving enzymes.

E.coli remaining E.coli is exactly what we'd expect, just as we'd expect eukaryotes to remain eukaryotes, chordates to remain chordates, vertebrates to remain vertebrates, tetrapods to remain tetrapods, mammals to remain mammals, hominids to remain hominids, humans to remain humans.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are human, and also hominids, mammals, tetrapods, vertebrates, chordates and eukaryotes. And we *always will be.*

Organisms cannot change their ancestry, and this is a cornerstone of descent. ""Cats becoming dogs"" would actually falsify evolution entirely. 

Maybe take notes, because I'm pretty sure you've made this mistake before.

Do we know genes can duplicate? Yes.

Does this allow novel function to be acquired while retaining original function? Yes.

Do we know genes can recombine, bringing domains of different genes together and creating entirely new functions? Yes.

Do we know non-coding sequences can mutate to produce genes of novel function? Yes.

Do we know endosymbiosis can occur? Yes (you can sit down now, Lynn)

t3_esr9ns,OddJackdaw,"&gt; Does mutation 'create' genes?



&gt; No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!' Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.

Of course not. But genes, unlike cars, are passed on when we reproduce, and the offspring of carrier of the mutated gene has a 50% chance of having the mutation, and at that point they *are* new genes. This ain't rocket science.

&gt; I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry

Neither the word ""proof"" nor ""proves"" appears anywhere in that study, so as usual you are strawmanning the studies authors. 

I'm not sure how you could even come to the conclusion that we think it ""proves"" common ancestry. It provides exceptionally strong evidence for natural selection, and it shows that mutations can survive in a gene pool for many, many generations without providing any apparent benefit, both of which provide *evidence* for common ancestry, but it certainly doesn't ""prove common ancestry"".

I suppose it is possible that *someone* got careless and said something close to ""it proves common descent"", but the studies authors did not, and anyone with a decent understanding of epistemology would not make such a claim. It is a flagrant strawman to suggest that the community at large would make anything close to such a sloppy argument. 

&gt; Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  

Pretty sure no one believes that-- at least no one who actually has a clue how evolution works-- so this is yet another strawman. 

&gt; The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen

Sci fi imagines these things, yes, but they literally have *nothing* to do with evolution. They are not real. No one who understand evolution thinks things work like that. 

&gt;An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

Yes. But any mutation that leads to a change that is either not harmful (though not necessarily beneficial) or is not so harmful that it causes the bearer to be unable to reproduce, has a 50% chance of being passed on, in which case it is ""already there"" in the offspring. It might be passed on for millennia by pure happenstance before conditions change, or (as was the case in the Lenski experiment) a second mutation happens, that makes the mutation beneficial and *then* it be selected for.

*That is one of the key things that the Lenski experiment shows:* That mutations that are not fatally detrimental can stick around in the gene pool long enough to eventually become beneficial.  

Your entire argument seems to be based on not just a misunderstanding of the Lenski experiment, but apparently a complete lack of even caring about what it showed. 

&gt; The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.

Your argument might have more credibility if you had the slightest clue what you are talking about. An no, that is not an ad hominem. Your argument betrays that you do not understand the paper you are arguing against *at all.* It is perfectly reasonable and justified to point that out.",1579777193

t1_ffb9ukf,Lockjaw_Puffin,"&gt;there should be at least a complete graduation of at least one species

Why? We already know that fossilization itself is an extremely rare process. We also know that a lot of fossils just do not survive the ravages of time due to exposure, scavengers, excess pressure in the rock the fossil gets buried in and loads of other problems. Even the best-quality [foram fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera#Evolutionary_significance) only go back to the mid-Jurassic. 

&gt;Not at all contrary to what evolution teaches.

Evolutionary theory says nothing about the quality of the fossil record, so this statement is nonsense. 

From your linked article:

&gt;Recent research has shown that Archaeopteryx skeletons had pneumatized vertebrae and pelvis. This indicates the presence of both a cervical and abdominal air sac, i.e. at least two of the five sacs present in modern birds

Neat! Unfortunately for creation.com, Archaeopteryx is not the ancestor of modern birds, so this information is *completely unnecessary and pointless* in the context of the article. I also note that they didn't mention that bit of info, so bonus points for lying by omission. 

&gt;Ruben noted the problem for the dino-bird theory in general: how would the ‘bellows’-style lungs of reptiles evolve gradually into avian lungs? The hypothetical intermediate stages could not conceivably function properly, meaning the poor animal would be unable to breathe. One of the first stages would be a poor creature with a diaphragmatic hernia (hole in the diaphragm), and natural selection would work against this. 

Basic argument from ignorance. ""We don't know how this could have happened, therefore it couldn't have happened."" Also...

[""When Brocklehurst and his colleagues used CT scans to compare the structure of the lung cavities of 4 modern crocodilians and 29 modern birds with those of 16 dinosaurs from across the dinosaur family tree, they found that all of the dinosaurs had vertebrae more similar in shape to those of birds than those of reptiles. This suggests the dinosaur vertebrae jutted into the lung cavity as they do in birds.""](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2183495-bird-like-lungs-may-have-helped-dinosaurs-rule-the-world/) 

From these, and the fact that you linked an organization that has ""By definition, therefore, no interpretation of facts in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record."" as part of its ""What We Believe"" section, I can tell you have no clue how to vet your sources.",1579776560

\&gt;It is also important to keep in mind that the process of natural biological evolution is *not* really a ""random"" process.  Evolution certainly has some ""random"" aspects, notably mutations and  genetic events during reproduction.  But the all-important process of  natural selection, acting under the pressure of an extremely competitive  landscape, often involving thousands of other individuals of the same  species and other species as well, together with numerous complicated  environmental pressures such as climate change, is anything but random.   This strongly directional nature of natural selection, which is the  essence of evolution, by itself invalidates most of these probability  calculations.

t3_esr9ns,WorkingMouse,"So, I fully expect that most folks here are about to lay into you pretty heavily based on the inaccuracy of your depiction of Prof. Lenski's work, the mechanics of mutation, and at a guess de novo gene formation.

Allow me to take a slightly different tact.

Before the advent of nylon production by humans, nylon and associated chemicals did not exist in the natural environment of earth.  There are, living today, populations of bacteria that can and do digest byproducts of nylon production.  We have samples of the same species of bacteria living in pouted areas that can digest such materials and samples from elsewhere that simply do not posses the ability.

Where did the ability come from?  You claim adaptation relies on things that are already there - yet this isn't.  You claimed mutation can't give rise to novel genes.  And yet the original strain discovered possessed three enzymes that were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by related bacteria, and they were not effective on any other material besides man-made nylon byproducts.

So, you tell me: where did these bacteria get a set of enzymes that aren't present in any other members of their species that would not have been at all useful prior to man's nylon production?

And while you're at it, tell me why later work on a bacterial species from an entirely different Phylum of bacteria evolved a similar ability that wasn't present in them beforehand when presented with an appropriate environment for such evolution to occur and in a manner which did not involve the same enzymes witnessed in the first.",1579776210

Let me explain, to be clear. H.sapiens is the name we use to describe a species (us). A definition of species is a group of creatures that can't interbreed.

t1_ff9elf1,azusfan,"&gt;A common example, which you've probably already heard of, is the evolution of E. coli strains able to utilize citrate as an energy resource aerobically, which is the result of modifications to a gene from a duplication event. 

Yes, I've reviewed the Lenski study, and others since. Here's one:

https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

I dispute the opinion that this is evidence of 'gene creation!' It is a modification, only, of an existing gene.  It is not a mechanism for trait creation.


&gt;Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population.

..this is believed, or hypothesized.   The more likely scenario, that has been observed and repeated in multiple studies, is that the traits were ALREADY THERE, and then 'selected' by environmental pressures.   There is no mechanism for trait or gene creation, so organisms can only draw from their gene pool, or go extinct, if they cannot adapt. 

*selection acts upon existing variability*

&gt;Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

Absolutely. It is evidence of genomic entropy, and degradation of the genetic structure, not increasing complexity.  Diversity *decreases* via time + mutation, and the organism 'devolves'  mutation is a serious problem for the belief in common ancestry. 

&gt;These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited.

This is believed, only.  There is no evidence for this, just conjecture and plausibility. There is no evidence of any gene or trait being 'created' via mutation.  It is always a deleterious process, and can only be labeled 'neutral!' by decree.

It is like wrecking your car.  It may still be driveable, and maybe the rattle you had before is gone now, but the accident did not create a new car.

I will address mutation further in a new thread, since that subject is of greater interest, it seems.  I will assume we are winding down in this thread.  I hope the posters here find that acceptable,  and do not flood me with accusations of 'Gish Gallop!', and 'starting too many threads!'

Not quite. Deadlyd1001 already answered that and the rest of your questions better than I could, so I'll just leave it at that. 

By the way, the answer to my question was &gt;!whales!&lt; - that's how different creatures can become after diverging from their common ancestor. 

&gt;How has classification not gone absurd, how are there only a handful?

As Sweary_Biochemist has [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eseb2k/show_your_work_for_evolution/ff9uik5/), it already *is* absurd, mainly because evolution never actually stops, but we keep trying to pigeonhole critters into neat little boxes when that's not really appropriate.",1579772113
t1_ffb9ikm,ursisterstoy,"And do this a few more times and the transitions blend together so that when you look from one generation to the next they are always going to be the same species, but there were no Homo sapiens over if you go back far enough with the closest thing you’ll find having the characteristics of Homo rhodesiensis. Go back further and same process. The names of the groups are unimportant because those are a human construct but go back more than a million years and suddenly the animals most like us are currently called Homo erectus. 

Evolution does not **EVER** say anything about one species of animal giving birth to another species of animal. What happens instead is a slow process like a gradient. There is no instance where it stops being Homo rhodesiensis and transforms into Homo sapiens suddenly all at once, but if we were to have ever generation of photos you ask for if we were to compare the organisms living 350,000 years ago to those living 300,000 years ago there would be enough of a noticeable difference that we might decide to call them different things and around 325,000 years ago we might disagree about which group to place those organisms because they fit exactly halfway between both groupings we came up with. The mother born 325,000 years ago and her daughter born some time later like 324,980 years ago will be exactly the same species. They are only ever classified as *different* species when they are clearly different enough to consider them different groups just like we don’t have wild wolves giving birth to poodles though they’re clearly the same species. The amount of change involved doesn’t happen all at once but when we compare the modern versions of each they are clearly different enough from each other that we call one “poodle” and the other “wolf.” 

Something similar happened as one lineage branches off leading to neanderthalensis and the other branches off leading to sapiens. At first they were still extremely similar and we’d still call them heidelbergensis but eventually around 70,000 years ago when they came back in contact with each other they were clearly different enough to classify into different categories even though they were not yet different enough to cut off the ability to produce fertile hybrids like how we can still make a mix of domestic dog and gray wolf. Clearly different enough to call them different things but not different enough to kill the ability to interbreed. If we simply add time and continued genetic isolation we get to something like horses and donkeys or lions and tigers that look even more different and though they can still produce offspring these offspring are infertile so that the lineages never blend back together. Even more time and they can’t produce any offspring at all like cats and dogs, rabbits and mice, humans and gorillas. At the same time, the morphological differences are even more dramatic so that the split is classified above the genus level providing us with carnivores, glires, and apes in each of these cases. This is the family level in linnean classification and genetics along with whatever fossils we happen to find provide us a bit of information about the higher levels of classification as each clade above species is the result of speciation much like explained above with horses and donkeys. Each clade below is generally based on how things look different, with more significant differences at the level of subspecies (like Homo sapiens sapiens compared to Homo sapiens idaltu or Canis lupus lupus compared to Canis lupus familiaris) than there is as the breed or ethnic group. With humans it gets a bit tricky because despite us being able to tell if someone had recent ancestry in one of several continents based, the population is blended to a high degree so that usually any given European might be a mix of German, English, Norwegian, and French all at once. There is so much blending this way all the way back that even what we call German consists of multiple Haplogroups found in other locations as well. With something like dogs it is more clear cut, because dog breeders have more control over keeping a dog a “purebred.”

The smaller more isolated groups tend to have less diversity than the larger ones and for humans the most biodiversity is still contained in Africa, so that everyone else is related to one of the same people around 70,000 years ago that left Africa but we have to go back to around 300,000 years to get to the most recent common ancestor of all of us.

&gt;We can therefore see that we should expect to see an inverse correlation between mortality rates and the virus’ ability to replicate—as the virus reproduces less efficiently, 

Um... why? As you mention in your post most often the cause of death happens to be a secondary infection. In the case of the 1917-18 pandemic some 90%+ of the deaths were due to said secondary infections, specifically bacterial pneumonia. I don't understand how one can say a virus is more or less successful if people die from a bacteria infection. 

Moreover this rational ignores many important factors in disease mortality. Namely the invention of effective antibiotics, vaccines, better hospital care, advanced knowledge of outbreak control. Just because some people died of what would largely be preventable deaths 100 years in the future, does a case for genetic entropy make.

There's also a number of other questions you've never addressed. 

- if 1918 was the maximally fit point of H1N1, then there has to be a mechanism to increase genetic fitness... how is this possible with a GE model? Waa there a creation event about a century ago?

- there's good evidence that H1N1 existed prior to 1917, why start the study at that year?

- H1N1 while extinct managed to be last years dominant flu strain... why is that? Why was it extremely common among children born after 2009?

- does wide spread vaccination have any effect. The record are incredibly complete and easy to find. Why not factor in disease resistance?",1579747617
t1_ffaheoa,CorporalAnon,"&gt;Viruses that kill their hosts tend to be weaned out very quickly, because dead hosts are terrible at spreading viruses. 

IK that the article claims to address this because deaths from Flu tend to be secondary causes, but that claim misses the point. 

Imagine I'm sick with Virus A, and you're sick with Virus B. Virus A produced a lot of viral copies, the creationist ideal. This, however, send my immune system into a panic and I can't leave my bathroom. 

Virus B has you feeling like crap, but not terribly so. Thus, you can take a drive to CVS. You touch and handle different remedies, which other people touch. You hand cash to another person at checkout. That cash touches other bills and gets handed out as change. On the way home you stop to get gas, and now you've touched the pump. Etc etc. 

It's easy to see that a virus that ""ideally"" produces a ton of copies but makes you so sick you can't leave the toilet is not going to be as transmissible as a virus which is more mild. This is part of why Colds spread so easily; they don't generally stop you from doing things that will transmit it.

t1_ff9gthg,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt;They do not ‘know’ anything, including whether or not they are going to kill their host and stop transmission from continuing. The only objective factor here, when it comes to the virus, is simply how many viruses are being produced, and how quickly. 

Half correct. Viruses do not ""know anything"".

Your objective factors are wrong, though: all that matters is propagation. Churning out billions of progeny viruses at the cost of killing the host can *massively hinder propagation*.

There are many strategies that are of varying degrees of success in different scenarios, and very few of them rely on 'host killing'. Herpex viruses, for instance, will infect and then become latent for years on end (suppressing their own replication), resurging when the immune system is stressed enough to make a resurgence viable, and spreading by direct contact. Then they go latent again.

This works really well, but by the Carter/Sanford criteria, this represents...what, sinusoidal entropy?

Basically, lethality is a terrible metric for viral 'fitness': H1N1 is a zoonotic virus, and like many zoonotic viruses, it behaves oddly in novel hosts. Swine flu and bird flu are endemic in pigs and birds (respectively), and there they are well-tolerated, which is what selection will inevitably favour. Cross the species barrier to humans, and what works in pigs/birds suddenly is non-optimal, and we see a much higher mortality. Over time, this lowers, both as a consequence of herd immunity, medical intervention, and selection for less-lethal behaviour. Viruses that kill their hosts tend to be weaned out very quickly, because dead hosts are terrible at spreading viruses (note that Ebola, while terrifying, generally ends up producing fairly geographically-limited outbreaks, because dead people can't wander around spreading virus).

The ideal adaptive process for a virus is to reach a state where it is both endemic and essentially asymptomatic, unable to be purged from the population and able to spread freely. 

This has, for example, worked incredibly well for the retroviruses that make up a substantial fraction of our genome.",1579735796

The results are not even as complex as a plant or an animal as the cell differentiation is more or less between growing the organism and dying to break off extremities or something else about as simple. It doesn’t come close to showing the development of an internal fluid filled body cavity, nerve cells, organs, or anything like that found in the more complex organisms. 

Somewhat related, but not necessarily going to provide any additional insight into the evolution of a unique trait is how we can grow organs and pieces of organs from stem cells.

t1_ffa40yj,Sweary_Biochemist,"&gt; Plus, they have simpler genomes meaning there is a much lower percentage of near neutrals to begin with. Most of their genome is protein-coding, if I'm not mistaken 

Doesn't stop drift: in fact smaller bacterial genomes seem to drift faster than larger genomes. Still not genetic entropy (and typically fitness increases instead). Either way you slice it, this represents a equilibrium scenario (that thing you claim cannot exist): mutations occur, populations drift, fitness typically increases because that's just how life be, and genetic entropy isn't real.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; No, there isn't. Mutations keep happening all the time.  

Yep. And the deleterious ones are selected against, the favourable ones are selected for, and the neutral ones allow drift. Voila: equilibrium.

t1_ff9ez1h,ursisterstoy,"And it’s actually more than a half a million sequential fossils because of heredity and sexual reproduction. There will be some along the way with traits that didn’t get passed on but even among just the ones that did we have to consider the problem of having two parents, four grandparents, eight great grandparents and so on just in our recent ancestry. Eventually these lineages converge on a smaller number of individuals like about 10,000 **per generation** instead of the continuation of the exponential growth and there’s no way we’d find them all in a timely manner if they happened to be perfectly preserved and most of them aren’t. The actual evidence we do have tells us which populations gave rise to which subsequent populations, especially when considering whole clades all at once and how they changed from the origin of one clade to the origin of the subsequent daughter clade. We may never be able to pinpoint every single individual along the way. For the most ancient ancestry we rely mostly on genetics, but around 540 million years ago some lineages started to leave behind more preserved fossils, and then for the last 2-3 million years we can do a bit better by being able to provide a sequence of which species gave rise to which subsequent species and it isn’t until the last 400-500 years that we can even remotely get anything resembling a family tree consisting of every specific individual along any specific branch along the way to any specific living individual.

Now the same thing still applies to just small steps in our evolutionary progression if the loss of the external tail wasn’t an all at once event and it’s not like we can expect to find the exact organisms that led to us still perfectly preserved so that we could create a slide show of pictures 15 or 20 million slides long for every direct female ancestor of humans. Also this poses another major problem, even if all them happened to be preserved, because we each have two parents that each had two parents which each had two parents and when we account for inbreeding between some of our lineages we do eventually drop back down to about 10,000 individuals pretty consistently all the way back but now we’re talking about more fossils than anyone has any time to post or find for 60 million years of monkeys slowly becoming human including the ape characteristics of losing a tail.

Why is there so much drama over it, then? People act like science is literally dying if others don't agree with their opinion on what is more plausible.

&gt;I think /r/creation was discussing 'redpilling' us with the simulation hypothesis.

That's kind of out of the scope of this sub, but it would be an interesting play. If we're in a simulation, that opens up the possibility of supernatural manipulation from outside of the Sim, and none of it is falsifiable. But that's more of a metaphysics argument than an origins one.

&gt;There's still no reason in reality to accept that humans were originally formed intact from mud and wind in the last ten thousand years as a brute fact: it's just something somebody wrote in a book way too long ago.

Well, humans by our nature trust each other by default. If we're told that it's true, then we have a reason that is sufficient to make it a default unless there is undeniable evidence otherwise. That trust is not a defect, either. There's pretty good science that appears to recognize it as a significant adaptive win and not a side-effect of some other survival strategy.... So if we don't have enough proof to answer the question of origins beyond any doubt, then we're going to keep believing what we've been told by people we trust.

t1_ffa7rnv,ursisterstoy,"It took me a few times of reading to try to process what you’re saying. So basically because of homology (and other things) we know how organisms are related and not something like we assume different groups are related and then we cherry pick out what they share in common and then use what we cherry pick to show they are related? If this is what you’re getting at, it is like Kent Hovind arguing that phylogenetics is just a bunch of us drawing lines on paper because of some similarities we find asking why we don’t say that birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects are all the same group because they fly using wings and why we don’t group organisms together based on how many chromosomes they have or if they have hooves without comparing any other trait. He’s also famous for asking to present what scientists declare to be *closely* related organisms in attempt to debunk phylogeny as evidence of evolutionary relationships when he provided the groups of “elephants” and “pine trees.” Why are they not the same? Because they look different and can’t interbreed. Not only did the lineages leading to both diverge something like 1.8 billion years ago but the actual evidence for how they are related is found within the individual cells - and this is related to homology. Organisms that diverged a very long time ago won’t look anything alike superficially but they’ll still have some structural similarities because of shared ancestry like endosymbiotic mitochondria, cell nucleus, stacked golgi bodies, and so forth. We have many of the same organelles and we have more genes in common with plants than we have in common with bacteria or archaea. 

Of course, he probably provided the answers he provided because he didn’t think we could find any shared homologies and then he made the mistake of saying a god is necessary for the creation of broccoli. These are the types of arguments typically presented by mainstream creationists but they’ve been getting more creative lately and despite their total failure they’ll suggest morphological similarities are evidence of common design and should be caused by the same genes because that how these traits are expressed. That’s really the best they have until you look at the details because everything else falls flat for being completely wrong or self refuting. 

Six mutations in a population causes extinction? No, every human zygote accumulates about 21 times that many. A population of one should die before it is ever born if this was the case. Inbred populations have reduced genetic diversity. Yes, but this is why we know humans aren’t the product of inbreeding 4350 years ago before we even look into evolution. Natural selection doesn’t add diversity. That’s correct, but without variety caused by mutation this mechanism can’t drive a population towards a subset of them - it would likely have no effect at all as a purifying mechanism. Whole clades that arose tens or hundreds of millions of years ago are related. Well yea. How does this help support the alternative? Genetic entropy, devolution, deteriorating genes - none of this happens and if it did and we were created the designer wasn’t very intelligent so that’s another shot against intelligent design. And now we get “homology is circular reasoning” which already fails to support any alternatives except for small superficial changes on top of fundamental similarities because we don’t just look at several superficial similarities- we compare whole genomes, we compare embryonic development, we compare the workings of the cell, we compare all of the things that are the defining characteristics of every clade as they arose over time and to fit within a daughter clade they must first have the defining characteristics of the parent clade or a known mechanism for the loss of one or many of those defining characteristics or fossil transitions showing that their group once had but subsequently lost one or more of those traits. That’s why phylogeny is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the evolutionary history of life on this planet. Morphological and genetic homology plays a big role in determining the placement of these organisms and it only works when nothing ever outgrows its ancestry when it gives rise to diversity and subsequent daughter clades. If suddenly mammals had the same feather as dinosaurs like birds or if salamanders started developing pectoral mammary glands and prehensile tails like monkeys we’d be a bit shocked and when evolution could no longer explain it we’d have to investigate other options. Since this doesn’t happen, creationists can’t demonstrate that it does and they can’t provide a mechanism for what doesn’t happen.

I believe in God and in a will and intent behind how life works and how we are in particular, but to answer one basic part of your question, we can look at lab science, because we've seen single celled organisms change into multicellular organisms (though rather basic) in a lab.

The way it works is pretty simple... When a single celled organism reproduces, it doubles and then splits. The most basic change, the one we've seen in the lab, is a generational shift from doubling and splitting, to doubling and hanging around in a clump. This behavior is determined by genetics in a way that can develop due to selective pressure, like the presence of a predator that eats small things but not big clumps, and then persist in the population even when that predator is removed.

That doesn't say much about how a clonal clump can change into organs and stuff... I expect it's a more significant change, and one that is harder to induce in a lab, but I wouldn't be surprised if science comes up with, or already has, a plausible natural explanation for it.

t1_ff9k920,Sweary_Biochemist,"The category names we give to clades are arbitrary, for convenience. And the more we learn, the less convenient the larger categories actually are. 

It is not, after all, like a single carnivore ancestor suddenly splurged into multiple carnivore descendant lineages all in one go, it's bifurcating lineages all the way, and not all happening at the same time: with one arbitrary carnivore clade (say, feliformes) there will be lineages that diverged more recently, while others that diverged longer ago, and lineages within lineages within lineages, none of which is adequately conveyed by sticking them all in a box and stamping ""feliformes"" on it. And as we learn more we start trying to wedge things into the gaps awkwardly, hence suborder, and then the even uglier infraorder.

A more accurate system is to list all the known divergences in a given species' ancestry, but this can get....very, very long.

And as you note, evolution never actually STOPS, so any given lineage will either die out or diverge into yet more lineages, while the Linnaean taxonomic hierarchy is kinda only appropriate for a static snapshot of lineages and ancestries as they appear NOW, to us. And as noted, it's not even great at that (next up, subinfraorder! Then infrasubinfraorder!)

Basically, the one unit we actually *can* use is ""species"", because it describes what we have *at any given moment*, but it's consequently always moving along with time, and what is a species today may in years to come be the ancestral population from which thousands of new species descend.

Biology is messy, and is under no obligation to conform to the neat categories we like to use. Taxonomic categories are arbitrary and not actually very good at detail, and are also not dynamic. As time passes, if we stick with broad-strokes box-putting exercises, probably 'species' will remain the front runner (with the little tentative feelers of 'subspecies' running just ahead), and we'll keep kingdom/phylum etc and just invent more arbitrary terms to fill in the new subdivisions introduced between 'species' and everything left behind.",1579721660

t1_ff8wu9h,andrewjoslin,"&gt;I have just presented ONE point.. natural selection.. to examine. I submit that the observable phenomenon of selection is a devolving process, not an increasing complexity process. 

No, you introduced multiple other points, in addition to natural selection, by saying these things in your OP:

&gt;Natural selection and breeding, are DEVOLUTION processes.. the organism is becoming LESS diverse, genetically, with fewer traits to pick from, in their lottery pick of genes.   
&gt;  
&gt;Natural selection is evidence AGAINST common ancestry, and does not provide any evidence that it can or did happen.

By asserting that the mechanics of natural are evidence against UCA, you are *forcing* everybody here to bring up mutation, because *the entire theory of evolution, not just selection, is relevant to a discussion of UCA*.  You can't just try to limit the conversation to half of the thing you're discussing.

So let's look at my quotes from your OP:

* Yes, selection is a process by which alleles are culled from a population, and each selection event generally results in a less diverse population.  I don't know what the definition of ""devolution"" is, so perhaps this does fit your definition of that term.
* HOWEVER, even though the above is true, it is NOT true that there is a ""lottery pick"" of genes.  Every generation introduces new mutations into the population, so that the number of alleles in the population (diversity) is generally *increased by mutation* and generally *decreased by selection*.  Over many generations, the diversity of the population will increase if mutation introduces more variation than selection removes -- or diversity will decrease if selection removes more variation than mutation introduces.
* Selection is not evidence against UCA, because everybody knows that selection is not the only process by which evolution occurs.  It is invalid to consider selection separately from all other mechanisms of evolution (and ignore all the other mechanisms), for the purpose of claiming that selection is evidence against UCA.  That's like ignoring the 7 in ""7+1+1=9"" and saying it doesn't add up.  It's like ignoring the engine in a car and saying the car can never get anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And of course, every organism can only draw from the 'lottery pick' of the gene pool they have. I am surprised you dispute this. 

As I have said, mutation generally adds random elements to the genome of every organism.  If you'd like to dispute whether mutation happens, then please provide your evidence.  If you want to save that for another post, that's fine -- just admit that selection alone can't be used as evidence against UCA.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to have a valid discussion of selection OR UCA, you cannot pretend that selection is the only thing which affects the viability of the UCA theory.",1579716472

The main point is that the study in the link shows that H1N!, over time the virus starts to degrade and isn't as good as infecting people as it was many years ago, which is proof of genetic entropy.   So looking at something like that and saying ""genetic entropy has never been induced in a living organism"" is both a willful lie (it has been induced) and not really relevant (the study was about seeing it in nature not inducing it in a lab.",1579713895

Why not instead investigate how easy it is to lose traits like tails? It is unlikely to be as gradual as you demand: generally speaking, you either need a tail or you don't. 

If you need it, you'll keep it, and chance mutations that result in tail truncation will be selected against. 

If you don't need it, you will still keep it until a chance mutation results in tail truncation. With no selective pressure to act against this, there's a fairly good chance this mutation will persist. And now your tail is gone. It could be as abrupt as a few generations.",1579711577

The post in question:

&gt;You're acting as if the statements made by those guys can be trusted. They cannot. Error catastrophe has been witnessed in nature (See Carter &amp; Sanford's H1N1 paper), and it has also been induced (or nearly induced, at least) through mutation accumulation or mutagenesis experiments (for just one example you can look at the Phage T7 experiment mentioned at creation.com/fitness). This is the reason why mutagenesis is used as a treatment for viral infections. If error catastrophe weren't real, then that would be a bogus treatment. Don't listen to their propaganda: error catastrophe is freely recognized by population geneticists. They aren't debating about it being a real thing; that's just the non-expert commentators dishonestly prattling.

First, H1N1 [didn't/isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ead3r/noahs_flood_genetics_not_so_much_xpost_from/dq3u81i/) [experiencing](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfivw6/all_in_one_place_a_detailed_response_to/f35pi9q/) [""genetic entropy""](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ajkw3w/so_just_a_final_update_on_carter_sanfords_h1n1/).

And finally, yes, mutagenic treatments exist for viruses (well, one does: a drug called ribavirin), but there are two problems with PDP's statement. First is that, even if it works exclusively via mutagenesis, it causes *lethal mutagenesis*, which is a broader phenomenon than *error catastrophe*. Lethal mutagenesis is just so many mutations the target dies. Can be all at once, or building up over time. Lethal mutagenesis is *specifically* referring to accumulation over time. To the extent we can tell, ribavirin acts via the former, but not the latter. But second, it's not even clear ribavirin works via lethal mutagenesis. [It has a bunch of other effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483), and the degree to which one or some combination of these are responsible for the observed effects has not been determined.

t1_ff8tsja,EyeProtectionIsSexy,"&gt;1. Increasing complexity, and levels of diversity.

By increasing complexity, would we be talking about the development of new genes for new cellular processes such as growth characteristics, metabolism, cellular components? 

What would we be able to measure to show this? I'm not trying to be annoying or funny when asking the same question, I just want to make sure I address your question correctly. IF we expect an increase in complexity, we expect to find ""_____"". What would that look like to you on the molecular level? 

Just to be clear, when I say molecular level, let's focus on the monomer level of cellular components, such as amino acids, fatty acids, nucleotide, and any modifications that can happen therein, such as individual sugar attachment, hydroxyl, ethyl or methyl groups. I think focusing at that level of cellular organization will help us better deduce what emergent properties occur as a result. 



&gt;2. New traits, that were not already present in the parent stock.

I'm going to answer this, but I have a few questions as well. 

Could you explain to me in your own words how this is different than an increase in complexity? Is this a specific type of an increase in complexity? 

A common example, which you've probably already heard of, is the evolution of E. coli strains able to utilize citrate as an energy resource aerobically, which is the result of modifications to a gene from a duplication event. This is a new trait that was not present in any other strain ever identified up until that point. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) is some information on the original experiment. They went through about 50,000 generations (probably should give a few thousand), with the mutation occurring ~30,000. This may seem like a lot of generations, however the pressures weren't the strongest. [Other studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800869/) have achieved similar, but different, duplication and point mutation events leading to the same utilization with cultures exposed under conditions designed to produce this at a quicker rate, such as 12 generations. Here we have novel characteristics never seen prior to 2008 in any wilt type population.


&gt;3. Selection pressures causing diversity, and increases in complexity, as the organism adapts to changing conditions.

This is what Darwin observed on the island. Competition for resources caused birds in certain populations to acquire new characteristics not previously present in the population. This can be tracked by measuring changes that occurred within the genome. 

If I can ask a question in response to this: Let's temporarily agree that humans evolved from apes. What increase in complexity and novel genes occurred as a result, and what molecular-level changes occurred to allow this to happen?

&gt;4. Infrequent 'low levels of diversity', as a mechanism for increasing complexity and new traits would add, not diminish, traits needed for survival.

I'm honestly confused, would you mind rephrasing this? I'm not sure what you're saying, sorry.

&gt;5. Observable, repeatable, definable mechanism(s) for increasing complexity.

We can refer back to question 2 about this. That experiment has been repeated a couple times, with citrate usage occurring after environmental pressure, with populations incurring separate mutation events to accomplish the same goal energy resource utilization. 

We know genes are inherited, passed down from parent to offspring (with few exceptions, such as horizontal gene transfer). Mutations occur because cellular replication is not perfect (duplication's, inversions, deletions, etc....), and environmental pressures such as UV radiation and cyclic oxygen compounds can alter individual nucleotide. Sometimes tautermerization temporarily alters a nucleotide structure, where a polymerase reads it wrong and produces the wrong copy. Certainly we agree on these right? That mutations occur and are inherited? 

If mutations occur and are inherited, this is how evolution occurs. Just like how we can measure the changes in E. coli over time, we can measure the changes that acquired between humans and chimps. We know exactly what mutations occurred, the genomes of both species has been sequenced thousands of times. These changes are a result of a culmination of thousands of occurred mutations that were inherited. We can go into some bioinformatic analysis if you'd like and play around with some numbers. We can analyze the genome of these species together, if you have the time.",1579711340

Yes there is mtDNA in-clade ancestry for every clade containing mitochondria but, even better, whole genome comparison takes us much much further than that and by including more genes provided a better more clear picture of their evolutionary relationships that just comparing about sixteen genes on their bacterial symbionts ever could. Devolution isn’t a thing. There is no end goal. Losses and gains of features are the same process working in all directions at the same time such as viruses that lost their more complex features necessary for being considered alive and how humans have gained a lot more complexity than their distant ancestor that they share with these viruses. Same process operating in different directions because there isn’t anybody guiding it along and in both cases an increased survival benefit despite completely different outcomes.

To get felines that are different from each other from a common ancestor or canids you start with a single breeding population, which has natural variation due to mutation, and you split them up so that cheetahs don’t breed with bobcats and neither of them breed with house cats and then among the house cats you get further variation due to mutation selected for by humans to get shaggy haired cats, bald cats, and cats with short hair. For dogs the same process in nature creates wolves, wild dogs, and coyotes and then wolves - just two or three varieties, are turned into several hundred breeds because of purification and hybridization to get poodles, greyhounds, Dalmatians, Great Danes, Rottweilers and German shepherds among others.

The field of molecular evolution uses principles of [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) and [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics) to explain patterns in these changes. Major topics in molecular evolution concern the rates and impacts of single nucleotide changes, neutral evolution vs. [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), origins of new genes, the genetic nature of [complex traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_traits), the genetic basis of [speciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation), evolution of development, and ways that evolutionary forces influence [genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) and [phenotypic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) changes.",1579702432

t3_es5qk3,Capercaillie,"""Homology is a circular argument"" is ridiculous.  Homology is a beautiful example of scientific prediction and hypothesis testing.  Let's suppose you go into a room and there are three people there.  Two of them have brown eyes, dark skin, and dark hair, and the third has blond hair, light skin and blue eyes.  If asked to predict which two are related, one would most likely guess the two that resemble each other.  *Now* you do a DNA test, and whaddya know, the two similar-looking folks have very similar DNA.  What you have is a lovely theory about common descent being indicated by resemblance, supported by separate evidence.  Now you find out that the two darker-skinned people live in the same town, speak the same language, and suffer from the same parasite infestation, while the other fellow lives elsewhere, speaks a different language, and has a different, though somewhat related, parasite.

If homology is forced to stand on its own, you might get away with making an argument that it's evidence of common design (but wait, isn't that a ""circular argument?""  You've said that similarity in structure is evidence of common design, but didn't you define common design as that which causes similarity in structure?).  But if you want to claim common design, you need to explain why your designer puts a tailbone in humans, and a pelvis on a whale, and a femur in a boa constrictor.

As the tips of each phylogenetic tree is reached, LOWER DIVERSITY is observed, to the point of extinction. 

Continued sniping about me, personally,  does not strengthen your position, nor evidence your argument. 

&gt;All of these originally originated from something resembling a shrew

..this is an unevidenced belief.  There is no evidence, such as the 'mtDNA in-clade ancestry', for the belief in these ascensions.  There is only plausibility,  suggestion, and vague, 'looks like!' conjecture.  Natural Selection has no evidence of increasing complexity,  or common ancestry.

I have just presented ONE point..  natural selection.. to examine.  I submit that the observable phenomenon of selection is a devolving process, not an increasing complexity process.

t1_ff8bc6s,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly?

That's a very big point to gloss over. The fact that it is only being 'considered' neutral, rather than actually being neutral, is a very big deal. Those mutations are not going to be weeded out by natural selection because they are too small. They are ""flying under the radar"". They also just so happen to amount to the majority of all mutations in general. Most mutations are very small in this way. So that means most mutations are outside the scope of NS to remove or weed out. And lastly most mutations are damaging. You add all this together and what you get is inevitable decline, which is the exact opposite of evolution. That's why this is important.  


&gt;Even if weakly deleterious mutations are fixed, it can open a new evolutionary pathway for a more optimal genotype that may have otherwise not been possible. 

Yeah, it's an ""evolutionary pathway"" alright: a pathway to extinction.",1579698243

t1_ff696tx,azusfan,"&gt;Look at the haplogroups I linked, there is no way to fit those into a single starting originator ancestor without mutations.

I don't follow the reasoning.  Mutations have been followed in organisms from the mt-MRCA. ..the first traceable organism in each haplotype.  The parent canid produced all the variety we see today, and probably more, that has not come up in the 'lottery pick' of gene selection. They had a mutation rate, that has been measured, and can be followed in subsequent generation (for those mutations that are passed on).

There is no conflict with the phylogenetic trees in each haplotype.  Humans spread across the planet, carring their inherited genes to lower diversity 'tips' in the human tree.  They settled in homogeneous isolation, with unique morphological traits defining them.  They could still interbreed with other humans.. they only had cosmetic, or slight morphological differences..  not enough to isolate reproductively. 

Their mutations could be followed, and a rate calculated.  Environmental pressures 'selected' the trats most beneficial for survival, though humans showed ingenuity in overcoming deficiencies in their physical traits.

Eskimos,  for example,  have little body hair.  Thick fur would seem like a 'good thing' for their adaptation. They did not freeze while waiting for evolution to provide them with this, but covered themselves with animal skins and fur, to compensate for their lack.

Some Sicilians,  otoh, are very hairy, even though they live in a warmer climate where a fur coat would not be essential to survival. 

Humans have the unique ability to adapt with ingenuity,  and are not dependent on the time and chance of evolving traits to adapt.  Natural selection is not as important of a 'selective' process, among humans,  because they have other means to survive in changing conditions.   

But most other organisms are completely dependent on their EXISTING genes, to draw from, to adapt. Natural Selection can only draw from existing variability..  it is not a 'creative' process.",1579697711

After this thread has expired from exhaustion,  i will be happy to examine the claim of mutation as the mechanism for increasing complexity. 

..and your continued obsession with my person is just a deflection..

Natural Selection.  Does it support and fit into the model of common ancestry and increasing complexity,  or does it support anf fit into the model of intelligent design? 

I see the physical evidence, and the observable phenomenon of DECREASING DIVERSITY, as evidence of creation, not common ancestry. 

There is nothing in SELECTIVE pressures that exhibits increasing complexity..  the opposite occurs.  There is no evidence that natural selection (or man directed breeding) has any ability or mechanism for increasing complexity or common ancestry.  It does the EXACT OPPOSITE.  It DECREASES  diversity, and 'devolves' the organism to lower levels of diversity. 

That is the singular point here.  Examining other alleged mechanisms for common ancestry can come later, but will fare no better, i predict.",1579694437

We have clear fossil evidence that some groups of dinosaurs gradually produced dinosaurs that over time became more and more bird-like.  Developing feathers, wings, beaks.  Over time these dinosaurs became so different than their dinosaur ancestors that we looked far more like modern birds than ancient dinosaurs so we started calling them bird fossils. 

Evolution works like language.  English speaking parents give birth to English speaking kids.  But look at the romance languages.  In the Roman empire, people spoke Latin.  These people spread through Europe to modern France and Spain.  Over time these groups became more isolated, and their language began to change separately.  Different areas came up with different slang, idioms, and slightly altered word meanings or connotations as well as gradually altering pronunciation of their words.  But a Latin speaking mother still gave birth to a Latin Speaking kid. 

So how did Spain get to the point that they have a different language altogether than Latin as well as French and Italian?  The population gradually changed over time to the point where us looking back say that the result is enough different than the origin to say they're a different thing.

For example, if someone’s IQ decreases by 1, then natural selection will have no problem with that. However, once the mutation that reduced their intelligence spreads throughout the population, then most people will have a reduction in IQ. These mutations keep accumulating, and once natural selection *does* have a problem with it (because the IQ is low enough), it will not be able to wipe out single individuals, because the entire population has those mutations.

t1_ff7t1rn,Sweary_Biochemist,"Some introns do things. Some introns can even be self-splicing (though these are rare). Some contain enhancers, either encouraging transcription or influencing behaviour of up and downstream genetic elements.

Mostly, though, these enhancer sequences are short, and fairly relaxed, in the way of most non-coding sequence. All an intron really needs is GT at one end, AG at the other. And even those rules get bent frequently.

Most intronic sequence is indeed basically useless (and accumulates mutations far, far more rapidly than coding sequence). There are many mammalian transgenes that are used both for research and therapeutically that are simply extant genes with the massive bulk of their introns stripped out (usually because we have to do so: dystrophin, for example, is 2.4 million bases long, but with introns removed, only 14000: 99.5% of it is just...intron). 

They work just fine, with the interesting facet that a gene carrying even a SINGLE intron will be expressed more readily than one with no introns, even if that intron is just filler sequence. The very act of recruiting a spliceosome seems to bolster transcript stability.

t3_es5qk3,ursisterstoy,"It is the articles like the one provided that young Earth creationists turn to when they say “the science is overwhelmingly in favor of young Earth creationism” but of course this would be wrong. Not only are these religious propaganda pieces wrong on nearly every point but even when they’re right it shows their ignorance of science. Dogs only produce more dogs. This is true, but that’s exactly how evolution works when *populations* divide and accumulate changes separately resulting in two or more subgroups. All of those breeds of domesticated dog are clearly different from each other so that we can classify them into different groups like “chihuahua” or “Great Dane” or “golden retriever.” They also share some striking similarities too, so not only do we know they are all the same “kind” of animal because of human involvement in selective breeding but we can look to their known evolutionary progression in recorded history, in their genetics, and in their morphology- especially shared homology. We know domesticated dogs are a subspecies of wolf. We know that wild dogs, coyotes, and foxes are all part of the same group despite wolves, domestic dogs, and coyotes being inter-fertile to varying degrees and wild dogs being too different genetically to breed with domesticated gods despite looking almost the same. The same thing applies to horses, zebras, and donkeys but to a smaller degree because these animals can make hybrids that are sterile despite looking like the same kind of animal. 

The same process that we use to develop dog breeds is the same process that natural selection uses to develop subspecies. Subspecies that don’t interbreed might result in different species that can still produce sterile offspring for awhile or they may form a ring species but eventually as the differences continue to pile up on top of the fundamental similarities they fully diverge into different populations no longer able to inter-breed at all. Then, they are no longer bound to wind up blending back together like could happen if we made a hybrid of all known dog breeds, for example, and selected for that while killing off everything that wasn’t a mix of at least two previous breeds along the way. Selective breeding creates divergent populations faster than natural selection normally does because we can control for the desired traits while in nature they (the animals) tend to select for something resembling their own group even in populations that actively breed in a way that results in the most diversity in that population. Like how humans tend to avoid close relatives, the same applies in the wild with other groups. While we don’t typically try to breed with non-humans (and not that it would produce any offspring anymore anyway) we do have this tendency to blend the traits of the entire local population together so that local populations can be told apart from foreign ones until the advent of high speed travel, anyway. 

The whole idea of different kinds of life created separately isn’t consistent among the groups pushing the idea nor is it consistent with the scientific data. The  Earth is more like 4.6 billion years old and not less than 10,000 years. There are cities older than they think the entire universe was and whole civilizations that don’t mention the flood that never happened as they also apparently lack any knowledge of Yahweh as they are building monuments to pagan gods during the time that the flood waters were supposedly pouring in with their own documents about different floods in different locations at different times for different reasons with different fluids involved. The ones most similar to the biblical account are from a region where several stories about it include a whole pantheon of gods - the one who created people being the one who warns the Utnapishtim, the Atrahasis, or the Xiusudra while the rest send the flood waters. Obviously it wasn’t global, but archeological evidence does support a localized flood. The creation story in the Bible and altered a bit for the Quran is also a lot like a collection of several stories from that region combined into the two different versions in the first two chapters in Genesis that they like to assume are part of the same event. 

When we are comparing science to the biblical version of creation there’s already a clear winner here so they like to mask it as intelligent design instead allowing for different creation stories in some cases. And we’re supposed to believe they have science on their side? I think not.",1579686314

Thus that particular mutation can be considered neutral. And all of this for what point, exactly? Realistically as far as I can tell, the practical application of neutral theory is to provide a null hypothesis for testing selection vs genetic drift. How does it support genetic entropy? These mutations may change some aspect of the genome, but that doesn’t support a slow degradation over time that will not be stopped.

There is no reason to see diversity as anything but a need to diversify. its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive. 

Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity  to others.

t1_ff7yxb7,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; Not trying to hijack this thread, but I really don’t understand the point you’re trying to make. Neutral mutations are, by definition and nomenclature, neutral. Neutral meaning they do not raise fitness nor do they lower fitness.

You are not correct. Kimura's 1979 paper (which I've quoted many times now) explains neutral theory in depth. All mutations are assumed to have a fitness effect, but it's a spectrum and at a certain point the fitness effect becomes too weak to overcome the effect of randomness that overrides it.

To quote modern population genetics:

&gt;The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely
that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it
has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some
effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However,
there is a class of mutations that we can term effectively
neutral. These are mutations for which Nes is much less
than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random
genetic drift.

doi.org/10.1038/nrg2146.

So there are two different categories of neutral mutations: strictly neutral  (no fitness effect at all) and effectively neutral. Neutral theory says that all neutral mutations are really of the 'effectively neutral' class, and there are no 'strictly neutral' mutations because all genetic changes have some effect, even if it's only very tiny.",1579663116

These neutral variants will become either fixed or lost as per genetic drift.

t1_ff7s72e,DefenestrateFriends,"&gt;How they propagate in a population is exactly what I am talking about.

It's not though. Your first premise of GE is:  
1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations 

Which I just showed is false.  


The third premise of GE is:   
3)  The vast majority of mutations are damaging 

Which I also just showed is false.   


Both of these premises say nothing about how ""alleles propagate in a population."" They make functional claims about the nature of mutations. The fourth premise of GE is the only premise which addresses selection coefficients in a population:   


4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

You badly lost that argument. It's okay. There is absolutely no shame in that. Science rewards being wrong because that's how we arrive at better answers. If you want to claim that the majority of mutations that are fixed in a population are, in fact, deleterious, that's even more of an uphill battle and is easily shown to be false via sequencing data. 

  


&gt;I want you to speak in terms that 1979 Kimura would understand. 1991  Kimura tried to throw Ohta under the bus for some reason, but the field  of population genetics has not gone along with him. 

Again, I invite you to perform the analysis using your own method. Just let me know what you're doing and why. There is no bus, Kimura was using the best available data and he was skeptical about some of Ohta's claims which are clearly laid out in his 1991 paper that we've already discussed. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Namely, you have only two categories to pick from: strictly neutral and effectively neutral. 

I don't, because that's not how the data and the real world work. We operate with evidence, not semantic definitions or misunderstandings from the late 60's and 70's.   


&gt;But Kimura in 1979 made no provision at all for 'strictly neutral' mutations. 

So what? 1991 Kimura did. End of story. It doesn't even matter what you call it. The mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism. If you are claiming that they do, then you must show evidence for it. It cannot simply be asserted or quoted.   


&gt; And Eyre-Walker and Keightly similarly make no bones about the fact that all mutations have fitness effects. 

Brother, it doesn't matter what they said or how you are reading it. It only matters that the claim is supported by evidence or not. Keightly is clear:   


“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95%  and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively  neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50%  of mutations are deleterious.**”

  
30% of mutations in coding regions are neutral. 95% to 50% of non-coding are neutral. 1% of the human genome is coding, the other 99% is non-coding. You can do the math there. The vast majority of mutations do not impact the fitness of the organism in any detectable manner. If it's not detectable, you cannot claim that they are deleterious. If you do claim they are deleterious, you need to show the data. Otherwise it's an untested assertion.   


&gt; 58 mutations is a laughably small sample size

Then, using 10 different tools to measure the integrity of the rivet with all of them giving the same independent ""no defect"" consensus and then cross-checking the rivet against several large data bases with known rivet defects and finding that your single rivet doesn't have any of those defects either, you say, ""I think it's good given the available data.""

&amp;nbsp;

This idea has problems, but only one of them really matters:

It's entirely self-defeating because it implicitly acknowledges that these regions don't have a function *at present*. That's conceded off the top, and then the argument is ""but they are built to acquire a function in the future"". Okay, and? They're *not functional right now*. So that's the ballgame, as far as I'm concerned. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, the purported mechanism through which these ""VIGEs"" would work to generate more variation? Those would be evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation, recombination, and neofunctionalization. So...yes? Is that the argument creationists want to go with?

&amp;nbsp;

Third, creationist might argue ""well, having the variation is inherently functional"", even if it doesn't do anything *yet*. Which, fine, but there are two knock-on problems from there. First, we know what that looks like. There are species (often microbial parasites) that are adapted to maintain a higher-than-expected level of variation, and we know what the hallmarks are - suppression of DNA repair mechanisms and frequent intra-genomic recombination, to name two hallmarks. And we don't see that universally.

Second, selection isn't forward-looking. It can't preserve stuff that isn't doing something *now*. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally (and related to the last point above), if these regions were ""designed"" for a purpose, then they'd be sequence-constrained, i.e. there'd be selection against mutation accumulation in these regions, to preserve the ""designed"" function. But they do accumulate mutations in the manner we'd expect if they were unconstrained. Meaning there just isn't a function there.

/u/nomenmeum is citing [the ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE): for the laymen, ENCODE was a genetic survey of the human genome, using the broadest possible definition of functional, in order to identify previously unknown areas of activity. And, naturally, they found activity:

&gt;The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical RNA and/or chromatin associated event in at least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event: 95% of the genome lies within 8kb of a DNA-protein interaction (as assayed by bound ChIP-seq motifs or DNaseI footprints), and 99% is within 1.7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE.

The problem is that 'one biochemical event' is a very broad term. It doesn't actually imply function: we have broken genes, such as our vitamin C synthesis gene, that are still involved in such an event, and they don't do anything anymore.

Secondly, given they used the broadest possible definition, we *know* that 20% of the genome has *absolutely no function*. That number can't go down any further.

&gt;Selection coefficients are what population genetics models are all about! 

It's a small component of a huge field that rarely anyone is concerned with, especially in the case of disease/pathogenecity.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; When you say ""functional definitions at the molecular level"", you're  going outside of population genetics altogether and you're putting out a  massive red herring that has nothing to do with what we're talking  about here.  

I'm not, and these kinds of studies comprise huge proportions of the field. Feel free to check out GWAS. 

  


&gt;None of what we've been quoting from Kimura, Ohta, Eyre-Walker,  Keightley, etc. has had anything to do with ""functional definitions at a  molecular level."" 

YES, that's correct for the most part. You have been quoting operational definitions and claiming that they confer functional relevance when they don't. That's the problem we are having. It doesn't really matter what semantic definition you decide to land on, you just need to show how you determine if a mutation is good, bad, or neutral. That's it.   


&gt;Kimura conveniently neglected to mention this was also HIS model, which he presented in 1979. 

Nearly Neutral Theory is an extension of his model which predicts that some weakly deleterious mutations can reach fixation in small populations when genetic drift is a more powerful driving force than natural selection. When the population is large enough, natural selection becomes the greater driving force again and the allele is removed from the population. This is not synonymous with claiming that, ""the majority of mutations are deleterious"" as you want to do. This is something that you can actually test right now. As before, show the data, not the misquote.    


&gt; In Kimura's own model from '79, which he is here trying to pretend  didn't happen for some reason, these 'very slightly deleterious  mutations' (effectively neutral) were a huge proportion of the overall  total. 

Kimura isn't pretending anything. You just haven't the slightest idea what it predicts or why and so you keep playing a semantic language game with yourself. I don't care what you decide to call a mutation, just show the data.   


&gt; Something else must be going on, but he's not being forthright as to his reasons for changing his story. 

Right. Clearly it's a huge conspiracy to deceive you. It would be totally unreasonable to suggest that you never understand neutral theory to begin with and now it's slowly started to sink in.   


&gt;Certainly modern scientists still view these effectively neutral  mutations as being prevalent, and the fact that they would be is so  obvious as to be beyond question.

For a more dramatic example mice are about 90% the same when we account for the genes shared by both us and them but the other differences (that matter less for survival) climb all the way to 50%. We also should be careful to not take a linear approach with the differences denoted here because 6 million years for a 1% difference and 65 million years for a 10% difference doesn’t match up on a straight line steady rate of change when we consider yeast and certain plant species that are still around 30% identical to us when considering just the shared genes but they diverged from us over a billion years ago.

Several trillion generations of organisms in the direct ancestor-descendant lineage from “the first living organism” (whatever that entails) to the time period we would give for the origin of of our species.

I worded it that way, because it is important to know that there are two basic laws that deal with evolution. They are called the law of biodiversity and the law of monophyly. Nothing transforms into something else fundamentally different than how it started (especially not in a single generation) but every organism ever born or produced by the reproductive practices of single celled organisms contains mutations so that *automatically* when accounting for these mutations and heredity the allele frequency of the population changes (something learned about when studying heredity in high school). All that this means is that there may be a different variants of the same gene in the same population but it may vary between 0% and 100% of the population containing any particular variant and with each new death or birth this percentage changes - diversity increases with more individuals.

With those two laws in mind and all of the facts like the number of mutations that occur, the sequence of how everything in buried underground, the genetic evidence and so forth we can reconstruct our phylogeny to give us a good picture of the process. 


https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMLnubJLPuw0dzD0AvAHAotW 

This playlist goes over the broad details. Obviously a lot more than I could explain in a single text response. 

There are also other things I could share regarding paleontology, genetics, and experimental data such as when several different single celled organism evolved multicellularity and basic cell differentiation (very basic) in a lab setting because many single celled organisms have the genes needed to move to multicellularity already and some of them regularly form colonies and it just takes the same thing but a more dedicated form to get to the major clades in the video series. I also talked to the creator of this video series recently so that if you do happen to watch it in your free time, and you get to episode 46 before episode 47 is released, he informed me that he decided to split up episode 47 into four different videos because of the vast amount of information just from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens (which is obviously towards the end of explaining how single celled organisms have rise to humans)

A more simple explanation, but without all the necessary details to fully explain the process, is that evolution is population based and those allele frequency changes I mentioned earlier because of mutation, heredity, and selection pressures (as well as other things like genetic drift) provides the increasing biodiversity *within* a breeding population like humans with different color skin, different color eyes, hair color, height, connected or disconnected ear lobes. Obviously, most of these changes don’t really provide much benefit or disability when it comes to survival and reproduction and often times a beneficial one won’t be very dramatic all at once though we have several examples of those too. The detrimental ones do slip in, but generally those tend to result in a shorter lifespan or infertility and some like sickle cell anemia also provide a benefit alongside the detrimental effect. Some like that and diabetes won’t stop new organisms from being born so they spread just like all the beneficial ones. What really matters is the general trend in a local population to acquire some trait (good or bad - with many “bad” ones resulting in death and infertility and not getting passed on). All that needs to happen from there is some reason for the population to split up into different smaller breeding populations more isolated from the whole group. At first the biggest difference might be nothing more than what we see across the entire population of living humans or they can be as dramatic as the difference between broccoli and kale. If the very same processes continue over time (everything related to evolution of a single population plus the genetic isolation between two sub-populations) the differences between these groups pile up. At first, when considering single celled organisms, many of the most noticeable differences have to deal with the working of the cell like the type of cell membrane, the type of protein used for synthesizing ATP, and sometimes, especially in our case, the acquisition of endosymbiotic bacteria that later become organelles. At this stage of evolution there is also a lot of horizontal gene transfer so that different species have a mechanism for sharing genetics making it a bit more difficult to work out the phylogenetic relationships (the parent-daughter relationships). After this results in eukaryotes and eukaryotes branch into many different sub-groups multicellularity occurred at least a handful of times within plants, what would become animals, fungi, slime molds and so forth. At this stage the effects of horizontal gene transfer have less effect and before this time sexual reproduction starts to play a bigger role (along with heredity and sexual selection). Several small changes and the same process continues to drive biodiversity but as time goes on certain populations acquire certain defining characteristics across the board and the rest of the group does off. Without dragging this on all day this results in the rest of the changes resulting in an internal body cavity filled with organs, bilateral symmetry and a brain, cartilage and bone, nerves, muscles, eyes and all of the other complex characteristics found in humans and whole groups of animals related to us. Some fish eventually took to the land and developed the trait of having four limbs (legs, arms, wings, whatever but always four or less as sometimes a loss of limbs defines a group). They get better at living on land, they develop mammal characteristics, they develop to living in trees, they start walking on the ground and using tools and they gradually become human. All the while the branching tree of life is continuing on so that side branches (like distant cousins) split off to eventually give way to other living things and several extinct ones. The entire time nothing is ever fundamentally different from the generation before or after it, but as a population eventually becomes more isolated and the in between forms die off we get those defining characteristics for every taxonomic clade with several found that seem to fit into two of them at the same time showing a clear transition from one to the other (just in case they were pictured as sister groups and not parent and daughter groups). This long paragraph is still just a very basic summary of how evolution gives rise to all of the biodiversity around us though some are quick to point out hybrids and nearly extinct populations showing little diversity which both happen as well and are completely consistent with evolution when you know all the details just like converging on the same traits *after* diverging into separate breeding populations because both groups still happen to live in a similar environment or are able to exploit a similar niche in a different one isn’t in any way contradictory to evolution.",1579647079

Eohippus is generally considered to be the first equid -- its feet had pads (and small hooves in place of claws), and the Wiki page describes a number of other ways it's different from modern horses.

Would you consider that a true horse?  If not, where in that lineage do the true horses appear?

Of course, anything in Eohippus' clade will always and forever be a member of all the clades Eohippus itself belonged to.  So the thing you want to see, ""evidence of one animal becoming another animal"" is neither expected by the theory of evolution, nor has it ever been observed.  The progression above does demonstrate, however, that variations can add up generation after generation and slowly lead to speciation.",1579645178

t1_ff6zeaw,CTR0,"A human giving birth to a fish would disprove evolution on two counts. The first is that heritage is continuous. A human's child having the genetic makeup of a fish would be impossible under evolution.

t1_ff6zeaw,andrewjoslin,"You should really look into cladistics:   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics) 

The fundamental principle is that no organism ever stops being what its ancestors were.  This means that humans are still apes, which are still monkeys, which are still primates, which are still mammals, etc.  So no, there's never been a case where an organism's offspring is something that is not in the same clade as the parent.  That's the whole point:  no organism will ever cease to be an ancestor to its descendants, and no organism will ever cease to be a descendant of its ancestors -- nothing in genetics would make sense any other way.  Even if some future organism goes on to form its own clade, it is still a member of all the same clades that its ancestors were.

What we *do* observe, repeatably in every life sciences field, is that offspring are generally *slightly different* than their parent(s).  The offspring of an aphid is still an aphid, and it's still all the things its parents were -- but it's not the same as either of its parents.  Nor are you and I exactly the same as our parents.  This is due to mutation, as well as sexual reproduction -- but it still happens in asexual organisms like bacteria, etc. (including aphids, which can reproduce parthenogenetically).

These changes add up over huge amounts of time (read:  many MANY generations), so that after all that time the organisms may (or may not) be a different species from their ancestors.  Modern dogs are descended from gray wolves -- and they are still gray wolves.  Modern humans and chimps are descended from some common ancestor in the clade Hominine -- and both humans and chimps are still Hominines.

Neither the theory of evolution nor the definition of speciation *ever* require a wolf to give birth to a non-wolf, or a horse to a non-horse, etc.",1579643878

t3_es11qk,Dzugavili,"&gt;If most small, deleterious mutations cannot be selected against, and build up in the genome, what real-world, tested mechanism can evolution call upon to stop mutational meltdown?

If they are deleterious, they can be selected against -- maybe not within one generation, but within enough degradations, it will have a selectable gap to the 'original' variants in the population. Statistically, because the genome is large enough compared to the mutation rate such that most genes will not change, even across large swaths of time, it is unlikely for an unselectable gene to fix at all and thus degrade the collective genome: the original variants are likely to still exist in the population, and they become the selected variant after enough degradation occurs.

Second, we're not sure what this would look like. It's not clear if genes can be rated so linearly such that such a point actually exists. It's also unclear whether or not unselectable beneficials -- or the mutations reversing this entropy -- eventually become dominant or bring this to an equilibrium above extinction.

Otherwise, we expect that beneficial variants will arise at a greater pace than neutral degradation could occur. Even if they are only minorly better, they will overcome neutral or extinction.

&gt;What do you have to say about Sanford’s testing on the H1N1 virus, which he claims proves genetic entropy?

He relabeled the axis for 'mortality' as 'fitness'. There are many reasons to believe that these aren't the same thing, as viruses attenuate to their hosts: they don't want to kill the host, they want to use them to spread. Mortality is not fitness, particularly as ultra-mortality, or what Sanford would argue is 'peak fitness', results in rapid extinction.

Furthermore, given we were combating an breakout, those numbers are going to be biased by our response. Mortality would drop off as the epidemic ends, and this has nothing to do with the fitness of the virus itself, but the lack of new hosts.

&gt;What about his claim that most population geneticists believe the human genome is degrading by as much as 1 percent per generation?

I don't believe these claims are backed with any serious effort. I highly doubt 'most' accept 1% as degradation, if they see any degradation at all. I have yet to see any efforts made to cite this claim.

&gt;If genetic entropy was proven, would this create an unsolvable problem for common ancestry and large-scale evolution?

No/maybe. This largely depends on where it is proven and the actual mechanisms.

Humans have recreated the world into a strange place, biologically speaking, and we have largely uncoupled the systems that have brought us here. We might be causing genetic entropy in other species through hyper-predation; we might be suffering genetic entropy because we live in a largely post-selection society. However, if this isn't innate to the algorithm, then nothing is wrong with our deep time analysis. Since it doesn't appear to operate in viruses or bacteria, we seem to be okay.

Otherwise, it may only predict the lifetime of one species. It doesn't account for speciation.",1579642617

t1_ff70b9z,youbetheshadow,"The ""kinds"" thing is sort of a false category to use post-hoc. Yes, we can say that there are different ""kinds"" of organisms; for example, some animals can't reproduce with other animals of different species. (This positively is not true for all animals, let alone all organisms, but it's a simple categorical framework we can use.)

So, fine. Cats and dogs are different ""kinds,"" but they themselves are large categories: wolves, cheetahs, ocelots, domesticated dogs, housecats, etc. So are cats and fish. Fish includes a phylogenetic lineage that comprises all mammals, all reptiles (and birds), etc. 

We can then ask: how are cats and dogs similar? Well, they both have fur, they both give birth to live young, they both have mammary glands, etc. Some very specific things. Then you can apply this to the category from earlier. How are fish and cats similar? Well, they both have eyes, they both have pharyngeal gill slits (ontogenetically, at least), they both have post-anal tails, etc. Less specific things.

&amp;#x200B;

Great. So one can put those groups into categories within each other based on comparative morphology alone. Why are fish not starfish? Because starfish (echinodermata) have 5-point symmetry, while fish have bilateral symmetry; fish have heads, starfish don't. You can generalize even further and say: OK, why are humans not algae? Well, humans need to eat food made by other things; algae make their own food. Algae are one cell (facultatively multicellular, but only very, very simply). Algae have cell walls; humans do not.

t3_es11qk,Sweary_Biochemist,"1) they build up until they're problematic. And then they're problematic, so they're selected against. It's that simple. Life will iterate to a point where most genes are 'working, but a little bit crap', because there's no selective pressure for them to improve (because they work), and active selective pressure against them getting worse (because then they won't).

Key point to remember: this has ALWAYS been the case.

&amp;#x200B;

2) it's balls. He equates 'kills humans' with viral fitness (this is not correct), and he doesn't even measure that correctly anyway.

3) It's balls. Selective pressure against humans is certainly lower in the western world (if you have eight kids, chances are all eight will survive. In the past you might need to have eight to successfully raise two). But all that means is there's greater scope for variation. Depending on how you measure fitness, you could argue that ""mean"" fitness is reducing, but only because you've lowered the lower extent. The upper extent is still *there.* To put it very crudely, helping more 3s and 4s survive does not make the 10s stop existing, but it might lower the *average score*.

4) It depends on how it was proven. Given all organisms accrue mutations at different rates (many *markedly* faster than humans) the implication is very strongly that if it exists, it is incredibly slow. If it is slower than actual *speciation*, it is meaningless. A species cannot degrade due to genetic entropy if that species has already become multiple other species.",1579641546

t3_etledc,MRH2,"Thanks for defining your terms and for this post.

&gt; Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we also remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

&gt; So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.   
after 2: 12/2/16.   
after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)   
One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial.

I want to figure out what you're saying here. 
Let's assume that at that mutated site, A is the original base. With 1 beneficial and two deleterious, lets say that beneficial is A-&gt;T and deleterious is A--&gt;G and A-&gt;C. 

So with one deleterious mutation, A-&gt;C happens. We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (beneficial relative to C),     
C-&gt;T (very beneficial relative to C), and     
C-&gt;G (from one bad thing to a different bad thing)

&gt; So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. 

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 2/1/0

Initially we postulated 1 b and 2d at this site. Now we have 2b and one n. **BUT** the problem is how you are defining things. You're saying that it's beneficial relative to where it is now.  If we look at the original genome and see what it is, we get a different situation:

A bad mutation has happened (A-&gt;C).  We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (neutral relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;T (beneficial relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;G (deleterious relative to the original genome)

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 1/1/1

I have trouble with you defining C-&gt;A as beneficial and C-&gt;G as neutral.  I suspect that if you follow it through using this way of looking at it, you'll end up with quite different results (maybe you or someone could crank this out. I had to actually use 4 specific bases in order to follow what's going on). And these results should provide a better match to observations of harmful mutations building up in populations (assuming that this is what we see).",1579957232

Since those 250 genes did appear, in one of a few specific sequences. There is a small enough chance of generating this non random complexity that we are completely justified in saying an intelligence ma de it happen.",1579955949

t1_ffgxenn,misterme987,"If SETI received an encoded signal coming from the direction of a system with a known Earth-like planet, sent a signal back, and over the course of several years, had a conversation with it, would they be justified in saying “It must be human, otherwise its unintelligent! Since we know no humans come from this place, and our only experience of intelligence is from humans, then we must have been conversing with random fluctuations from a star. Move along people, we’ve got more work to do.”

Or, if one day we discovered that all [insert non-human organism here] were sentient, and we observed them talking to each other, then would we be justified in saying, “It’s a new subspecies of human that we’ve never discovered before!”

If enough signs of intelligence are seen, it’s justifiable to say that an intelligent mind is involved.",1579955673

t1_ffgwlig,misterme987,"But it’s not like *this* type of information. That’s why I used the term non random complexity. Trees growing in this way happens according to natural laws, so it is a *necessity*. However, DNA could be in any configuration according to natural laws. But because it is in one of only a few specific configurations that produce life, a better analogy would be semantic information (even though its not a perfect analogy).

There’s a difference between “ABCDabcdABCDabcdABCD” or “KtbWo0FafGKEmBdYRm6m” and “Four score and seven years ago...” This is the same with DNA. There is a difference between the *incredibly specified* sequence of a functional gene, its TATA box, its enhancers, and the sequence of a random string of DNA.

The only known cause of non random complexity (specific complexity, complexity that produces a desired effect, whichever definition you want) is an intelligent mind.",1579955181

&gt; Biblically we'd expect to see ancient horses, donkeys, and zebras to have nearly identical mtDNA.

It's expected because under the YEC timeline, even if founder effects cause new phenotypes to arise rapidly within a couple hundred years after the flood, there wouldn't be enough time for very many mtDNA mutations to have arisen during that time.

&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

Concede the evidence we have in hand, outside a literal reading of Genesis, the case for deep time is favored right now, but future discoveries could change that.   

I'm a Young Earth/Young Cosmos creationists, and I've studied astorphysics, cosmology, general relativity.   The most you can hope for is to throw doubt into some of the mainstream ideas.  If you go around pretending the evidences we have to day is slam dunk for a young cosmos, you'll lose credibility.

A mathematical physicist friend of mine said there is much we don't know, but if life is young, and the fossil record is young, and hence a good part of the literal reading of genesis is confirmed, why not be open to the possibility other things are young. 

Talk about how variable speed of light is put on the table by mainstream physicists to solve problems in the Big Bang hypothesis. There is also the inflation hypothesis where the amount of matter of all the buzzillion galaxies we can see was postulated to move a thousands if not millions of times faster than the speed of light -- how is this any more outrageous than anything the YECs say?

The Big Bang suffers a lot of problems and in 2019 many articles came out saying cosmology is in crisis.

Point out the case for creation has improved over the last several decades but there are problems.  If the trend continues of more facts over time being revealed that support a literal reading of Genesis as history, then we should expect evidence that will help solve problems in the YEC/YCC models.

That's a honest answer.


&gt;It is determining whether the science sides with Creation or Deep Time. 

What do you mean, ""Science sides""?  We can only speak of the facts we have available, but what we have available to us today is a minuscule sample of all the facts we might be able to discover.  Most scientists will say deep time.   Does that make it right.   If you ask, ""what do the facts say""  are you talking about the facts we have available to us today, or do you think maybe we don't have as many facts to settle the case.  I'd say, we don't have many facts as we'd like. That's why cosmology is in crisis.

Don't expect you'll defeat your opponent on astronomy today, maybe some years down the line if God grants more facts.


You will have a good case for a young fossil record and young life.  There are a few creationists who think the fossil record is young but the universe is old.  Not that I agree with that position, but make clear the case for Noah's flood doesn't necessarily depend on the solar system being young, it only depends on the fossil record being young.",1579936989

Physics and *history*?- this is interesting because you declared atheism as part of your worldview,  not a product of it. 
The
Weltanschauung, originally intended as a stab at objectivity is self defeating. It, by virtue of an excess of brute apriori assumptions negates its own ability to positivity verify its claims. 

""in his Critique of Pure Reason (1781). Dilthey intended to fashion a critique of reason on behalf of the historical human or cultural sciences (Geisteswissenschaft ). For Dilthey the goal of natural science was causal explanation, whereas the goal of human sciences was to achieve understanding by means of interpretation. Every interpretation, he reasoned, takes place within a larger understanding of the world (i.e., a Weltanschauung), which itself is historically conditioned. Thus, interpreters of human history and culture must recognize their immersion in a particular historical situation and tradition and in that process come to terms with the finitude of their perspective. The irony of Dilthey’s historicist conclusions lies in the fact that they undermine his original goal of establishing universal validity for judgment in the human sciences. This split or contradiction resulted in differing orientations to the concept of the Weltanschauung among thinkers such as Freud, Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer.""

The YEC case for craters should be that the big ones hit earth when no people in the way. Thus after the fall.

Thus a tiny, tiny, bit of shrapnel got through. after the flood only small impacts in the most remote areas have hit. Likewise craters on the moon probably all hit at that time. I read, vaguely, that most moon craters are on one side thus this unlikely if they are random over long timelines. Perhaps wiki the moon. Anyways crators are episodic surely.

Geneis clearly teaches light was created on day one and was everywhere. Then divided for boundaries. Nothing to do with sources of light like our sun/stars. This means its impossible. I think. that light moves from here to there. So there is no speed of light. Instead just light poking out from some provocation. After this then light is not proven to be coming from stars from long ago. Its complicated as a option. its not proven light comes from deep time. Its just a line of reasoning from present rates of saying light moves from here to there.

The asteroids simply , as a option, are more of the same as the origin of crators. Smashed up stuff from events in the past that stay in orbit. They prove the universe is deacyed and decaying.

&gt;""It's a mystery"" holds no weight in contemporary philosophy of mind if you can't give a good argument for it.

Guilty until proven innocent doesn't hold weight in a court of law, either. Or in philosophy. If there's a problem you have to demonstrate that problem, not merely assert it. But we don't know enough about spirit or matter to come anywhere near saying that they would be incapable of interacting.",1579812067
t1_ffd1odp,Rayalot72,"&gt;No, LFW does not entail random choices at all. Agent causation is not randomness. You're applying deterministic thinking where it does not apply.

&gt;There is no interaction problem. There is an interaction mystery, since we don't know enough to understand how the interaction works.

t1_ffd18yg,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; This isn't true. Quantum phenomenon can have macroscopic effects, and this is a principle that is required for quantum computing.

What I meant by that is that the unpredictability in the quantum realm, even if it turned out to be random, does not mean that the macroscopic world is unpredictable or random. In some way that seemingly chaotic system is not really chaotic at the macroscopic level. That's why science is possible at all.

&gt;You seem to be making a weird claim about LFW here. LFW entails that choicrs are truly random. A choice between A and B involves some probability for A and some probability for B, and the outcome has no sufficient conditions. Otherwise, determinism is true.

No, LFW does not entail random choices at all. Agent causation is not randomness. You're applying deterministic thinking where it does not apply.

This isn't true.  Quantum phenomenon can have macroscopic effects, and this is a principle that is required for quantum computing.  

&gt;Third, indeterminacy is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for freedom. For an agent to make a free choice, he must be the originator of the choice and in control of it. But if quantum events are truly random, this leaves no room for agency.

The moon. The only theory that exists right now that is even a possibility is that God made it. The moon is much warmer than expected, supporting a younger age hypothesis. The moon may even still have volcanic activity. It serves so many useful purposes, as if it was designed to do so. The solar eclipse is pretty compelling evidence for creation imo.

Stars. The Bible says God created them, and we’ve never observed them formed by any other means. Stars don’t live as long as the current estimated date of the universe, so the current existence of stars is evidence of recent creation.

Magnetic fields. Dr Humphreys made a model that accurately predicted the magnetic field decay of planets in our solar system before they were measured, based on a 6,000 year age.

&gt;In case you are wondering about the new ""coronavirus"" people are talking about:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. It is related to the common cold, for which there are no vaccines.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. It kills a lot of people it infects.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. It probably jumped to humans from bats. A similar virus from a few years ago, SARS, jumped to humans from civet cats.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. We do not know how it spreads, how long it will circulate, or if it will truly go pandemic.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. The main thesis I operate under is that viruses that hang out within a species are attenuated. In many cases, they are harmless to the host. But, when they jump to a new species, they burn hot and fast and cause a lot of damage before they either burn out or become weakened. Thus, the appearance of a new virus within humans is a serious concern. No need to panic, but definitely something to study hard. BTW, multiple sequences of this virus are already publicly available. It is amazing how fast sequencing technology has advanced and what this means to the future of global health. Go science!",1579802922

In 79 Kimura acknowledged that there were no strictly neutral mutations. Then he went back on it later on.  


&gt; Nearly neutral theory also had problems, Kern said: It did not explain, for example, why the rate of evolution varies as observed among different lineages of organisms. 

Is this a problem with near neutral theory, or a problem with the idea of Darwinism?  


&gt; Kern agrees: The neutral mutations are still neutral — but they are not behaving as neutral theory would predict. Purifying selection at linked sites, he wrote, would “add noise to allele frequencies beyond drift,” while background selection and hitchhiking would lead to less genetic variation than under neutrality. 

Hitchhiking is a major problem for evolution of course since very few mutations are 'beneficial' to begin with. But still we see the confusingly vague term ""neutral"" here. Population geneticists affirm that ALL mutations have some effect, so there are no strictly neutral mutations.  


&gt; Parts of this noncoding portion of the genome are riddled with repetitive DNA sequences, caused by transposable genetic elements, or transposons, that copy and insert themselves throughout the genome. According to [Irina Arkhipova](http://www.mbl.edu/jbpc/staff/arkhipova/), a molecular evolutionary geneticist who studies the role of transposons at the Marine Biological Laboratory at the University of Chicago, “this portion of the genome is quintessentially neutral in Kimura’s sense,” even if some fraction of those transposons do affect the expression of genes. 

More of the same hubris in assuming that if we CURRENTLY don't know what something in the genome does, then it must be useless junk and any changes to that region must be 'strictly neutral' with no effect at all on the organism.

Usually, atheists will point to this article and state "" Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while all other great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) have 24 pairs of chromosomes,"" Belen Hurle, Ph.D., says via email. Hurle is a research fellow at the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov/) at the National Institutes of Health. ""This is because in the human evolutionary lineage, two ancestral ape chromosomes fused at their telomeres \[tips\], producing human chromosome 2. Thus, humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes. This is one of the main differences between the human genome and the genome of our closest relatives."" or something to this effect.  [https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/23-pairs-chromosomes.htm)  

The problem here is that they see the result and auto assume it's  because of fusion. It's like saying I see the result of a screw being screwed in and think it's the result of a power drill. Possible, but there are other possibilities. It could have been a human manually screwing it in. It could have been a child using a different tool. The point is they jump to the conclusion that it's fused when it could have been created that way with the telomeres matching up 

So now, in order to give evidence for fusion, they must choose one of two paths. Either the fusion happened in one generation or it happened gradually.  

If it happened in one generation, they must prove that the mutation is common enough that a population of 50 (somewhere around this range. I don't remember which paper it was, but just look up population size needed to propagate mutation. It should pop up) within one generation happened otherwise you don't have the necessary population to propagate this mutation.

If it happened gradually, they need to prove each step  of the mutation wouldn't kill the host. Herein also lies another problem. It is well known that extra or missing chromosomes cause problems to the host. Most famous are down syndrome or turner syndrome.  [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/chromosomalconditions) 

But those with down syndrome or turner syndrome are LESS FIT. There is no way the ""survival of the fittest"" would choose these organisms. Just look at how much care parents have to give to those with down syndrome. I know of no additional or decrease in chromosome that is not either detrimental or simply benign.  Basically, none of these special conditions of having extra or one less chromosome will lead to a more ""fit"" organism. Even if it did, again, they would need to prove the mutation is common enough to support a population that is large enough to propagate this. But again, they need to do this for all steps. It's not enough to show it's common enough and it's fit for one stage. ALL Stages must meet these conditions otherwise the mutation would die off.

That's likely false.   Up to 90% of heritable disease is associated with non-protein coding regions in humans.

Sure it does for the reasons just stated.  Before you jump to that conclusion considered the D4Z4 repeat:

https://genome.cshlp.org/content/29/6/883.full

Yes, but there will be plenty that remain.  

In Genetic Entropy 2.0 I showed a lot are REMOVED, but that doesn't stop the deterioration.  Do you see that?   You can do that with a very large population and argue 99% are removed, but the problem doesn't go away. 

The reason is, if 70 mutations enter each individual each generation, in 8 billion people, that 56 billion mutations entering the genome per individual per generation.  The problem is that even if billions are removed by killing off billions of people, the individuals  that survive will retain most of the  70 mutations they inherited, so the accounting here is incorrect.  The proper accounting is how many are retained per individual! Not how many are removed from the population!!!!!  Drift talks about removal of mutations from the population, but this doesn't account for how many mutations per individual are retained.  Genetic Entropy 2.0 shows the proper accounting per individual.

&gt;And even if some genes escape genetic drift, once they degrade enough they will be selected against.

That's not known, and few if any experiments demonstrate that as a general rule since most observed evolution is REDUCTIVE.  REDUCTIVE evolution is the dominant mode of evolution, not constructive.",1579656762

Genetic entropy is the accumulation of *slightly* deleterious mutations over time, mutations whose individual effects are so slight that *selection does not weed them out.*  The cumulative effect of these mutations, however, is what destroys the species.

So they're down to 99 no problem.  This can go on until they're down to 12, and maybe no defects.  Once they go down to 11 or less,  they get muscular dystrophe.

Of course we can withstand a lot without dying, that's actually the problem.  

Have you seen the Genetic Entropy 2.0 video.  Look at the last 10 minutes or so.  See what happens when the organism doesn't actually die, but just keeps accumulating slight defects with each generation.

You don't even need the 80% figure of ENCODE, just go for 15% and the problem doesn't go away.


One of the problems is ROBUSTNESS or fault tolerance of the genome.  The space shuttle have 5 navigation systems, and if 4 go out, the shuttle keeps going, but if all 5 are out, then its fatal.  The problem is selection won't see fault tolerant systems in the human genome or erase defects in these systems.  Think about that!

That means, these systems are easily degraded and may never recover from the degredation.

Absolutely!


First off, enhancers sequences can sit on exons.  So, let's not be too quick to dismiss little changes in DNA sequences even those that are synonymous/silent changes to the proteins, not to mention it affects kinetics of translation.

Selection coefficients are how population geneticists define :
deleterious, neutral, beneficial.  However, these are really terrible measure of function since many ""beneficials"" are actually function compromising -- remember the ""beneficial"" mutation of sickle cell anemia?

The fundamental issue is small defects cannot be easily purge from the genome for the reasons you can see here in the haploid case:

The second is that

&gt; Most mutations are neutral, because deleterious and beneficial mutations only happen in protein-coding genes (this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact). The ones that are deleterious only happen to a small percentage of genes at a time, because there are so many genes in the genome. Since the entire genome isn’t being degraded at once, the wild-type which still exists in the population will survive due to the probabilities of genetic drift.

Is a little off. There are also regulatory regions and functional RNAs (important note is that not all transcribed RNAs are thought to be functional, let alone more significant than small tuning effects). The later is that the reduced selection against humans isn't being fixed by drift, it's just that it's not (as) deleterious in our modern environment. If we were plunged back into prehistory we would go back to selection pressures where that was deleterious. The part about ""degrading enough to be selected against"" still applies though.

The labs would not be told anything about the samples. Success would be if the various labs generally agree with each other (without communicating) and the timelines correspond to the old earth paradigm for the strata (for example, lava flows encased in Cambrian sediments are dated older than tertiary samples), and for the known samples, like Vesuvius, St. Helen and others, they would be close enough at +/- 5,000 years.

As a source, how about the same article Dr. Menton cites: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/278/5341/1267

&gt; Like theropod dinosaurs, most early birds, including Archaeopteryx and the enantiomithines, were likely to have retained bellowslike septate lungs.

Like when I explain to you that K-Ar is a high-resolution dating method with a half-life north of a billion years, and the very next comment you go on about four orders of magnitude as if *that* were the relevant datum.

At the resolution of the K-Ar method 300,000 is *very* close to 0. If you time a 100m race with a calendar, and the result you get is ""one day"", that result is accurate. Going on about orders of magnitude is just obfuscation.

No, this is absolutely false. It's the intercept of the complete isochron, not a mean or even just the plateau, that gives the 1925BP date.

Please note, also, that step heating is normal procedure, not some kind of fudge. Here's an example for [a much older rock](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/40-Ar-39-Ar-step-heating-age-spectrum-and-isochron-diagram-of-DN-13_fig2_250966765). The more tightly bound the argon is, the less likely it is to have been contaminated, and the higher you need to raise the temperature to liberate it. This is why you get the plateau effect, with anomalous dates at lower temperatures (= rims of the sample) that gradually level out as you get to the real, intrinsic argon.

In this case, however, this is *irrelevant anyway* because the isochron plot tells us that contamination wasn't significant (since the analyses fall on a straight line - in fact the fit was even better than they'd expected).",1579608877

As they were heating it with the laser the 40Ar left the rock? Each time they measured, there was less and less 40Ar, which lowered the date until the date gets to essentially the bottom threshold of the test's detectability (where the dating age starts to level out)?

However, the authors state: 

&gt;""based on the preserved length of the tail and available measurements of the preserved caudal vertebrae, we estimate that a complete caudal series is likely to comprise more than 25 caudal vertebrae""

&gt;the 40Ar/ 39Ar apparent age (10) calculated from the sum of all gas released is 3300 +- 500 years, clearly distinct within error from the known calendar age. With the known age, the concentration of extraneous 40Ar can be estimated...

*... from the weight of the sample (0.430 g), the total air-corrected 40Ar released (2.9 x 10^14 mol), and the K content (12.5%) of the sanidine, yielding (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^14 mol/g.*

Where do they say this?

Expected in what circumstances? There's no question of geographic dispersal, remember, because they all appear in the same regions. And over the next two thousand years they remain in a pretty stably recognisable form (and if you respond that selection swiftly eliminates the genetic variation required to allow phenotypically distinct subpopulations, then isn't the presence of highly heterozygous pairs on the ark, 1500 years after creation, the Scylla to that particular Charybdis?)",1579474549

The claim against the evolutionary view is that the mechanisms of random mutation and natural selection cannot, by themselves, explain the existence of irreducibly complex systems.  Evolutionists can agree, on one hand, that an irreducibly complex system that lacks a single part is no good for the intended purpose of the system; but on the other hand, pointing out that the system, existing as such (lacking the part which prevents it from functioning as the system we had in mind), may be able to serve some other function; and finally, that a small change could result in some such system coming to be useful for some new and higher purpose.

Strictly speaking, this is not a terrible position to take - although it does introduce new problems.  For example, if the function of the old organ could be so easily lost, why was it previously a subject of positive selection?

I said that if someone wanted to advance a scientific argument in defense of creationism that I'd be happy to take a look at it and offer feedback in the (very likely) event that I didn't find the argument convincing.  I thought this might be useful in the event that your goal in advancing a scientific argument is to persuade people of the truth of creationism who are not already persuaded.

With regards to atheists in foxholes, it doesn't matter (from a scientific point of view) who coined the phrase.  What matters is whether or not it is *true*, and then, if it is true, whether it has any bearing on the truth of creationism.  In this case neither one is true.  There are in fact atheists in foxholes, and even if there were none, that would not be evidence of a creator.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e9mdo4/evidence_for_the_creator_mitochondrial_dna/

Quote from the Gibbons study:

 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/279/5347/news-summaries

 ""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate. For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old. ... The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..""
...
""The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were “stunned” to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled..""


So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the status quo dogma.  

Mitochondrial DNA carries a genetic indicator of matrilineal descent, and can trace that descendancy all the way back, to a Most Recent Common Ancestor.. the mt-MRCA. It is ONLY passed on by FEMALES.. mother to daughter. The males get it from their mother, but it stops there. Only the DAUGHTER can pass it on.

For this reason, the mt-MRCA has been called 'mitochondrial eve,' ..not because the crafters of the phrase believe in the Genesis account of human origins, but as a cultural reference in western civilization. Most people in western civilization catch the reference to a single 'Mother of all Humanity.' 
The significance of the discovery of the mt-MRCA is often ignored and overlooked:

All of humanity, alive and dead, that has testable dna samples, can be traced to this 'mitochondrial eve'. She is the only, single human ancestor we can identify, and all of us descended from her.

Neanderthal, Pygmies, Eskimos, Norwegians, Aborigines.. any and ALL human people groups, alive or dead (with traceable dna), are descended from this mitochondrial eve.

This matrilineal descendancy is present in other organisms, and THEIR ancestral lineage can also be traced. Canids, felids, equids, etc, all have clear lines of descent, from the original mt-MRCA, in their respective haplogroup/clade/phylogenetic type.

This mitochondrial 'indicator' does NOT cross genetic boundaries, but is exclusive to the particular haplogroup/phylogenetic structure. Apes and chimps do not have the human mt-MRCA, nor do humans have any indication of sharing common ancestry with ANY other species/clade/phylogenetic type. Humans are descended from humans. Apes from apes, canids from canids, equids from equids.

The discovery of this matrilineal descendancy in the mtDNA has been a scientific boon. It has refuted many assumptions and beliefs, that are abundant in the theory of universal common ancestry, and are a problem for those who believe this theory.
I predict as more information is discovered, especially in genetics, the theory of common ancestry will join the flat earth, the 4 humours, and spontaneous generation, in the dustbin of debunked scientific theories. It has become a Religious Belief, complete with fanatical True Believers, who defend it with jihadist zeal, but they are unable to debate the science behind their beliefs.",1579443137

Is the horse a different species than a donkey?  They can mate, though the progeny is sterile.  They also share the same mt-MRCA. 

I would classify these as different clades, or haplotypes, from a common clade or haplogroup. If the genetic lineage can be traced, then the sister clades, from the same mt-MRCA indicates a common genetic heritage.  Differentiating 'species!' only from morphology, or 'looks like!' subjectivity is contrived, artificial, ambiguous,  arbitrary, and unscientific.

t1_fd6t957,JohnBerea,"Wow it's already been two weeks.  Sorry about that.

One could argue God had theological reasons for wanting all humanity to descend from a single couple... but in a way you're right about there being a slippery slope when it comes to good vs better design.  My suggestion that Adam and Eve were very heterozygous is simply assuming the best design allowed within the parameters described by the bible's description of a founding population of two.  It could even be a wrong assumption.

Above you mentioned ""I seem to remember archaeology can establish the rate independently of this, though?""  The point I'm making by quoting that paper is that most mtDNA dates don't match up with archaeological migration dates, even though the authors' dates do match up.  If we take the authors' dates and ignore the others, that's cherrypicking.

This is a topic I want to explore in more depth, but from what I've seen the mtDNA differences between organisms within most species would take about 6-10k years to accumulate, based on observed mutation rates.  In response evolutionists propose that selection removes about 95-97% of mutations that land in mtDNA, an amount that comes from counting the number of differences between human and chimp mtDNA and assuming a human-chimp common ancestor lived about 6m years ago.  Thus they calculate mtEve would've lived 200k years ago and not 6k years ago.  IIRC the mtDNA barcoding paper also used this slower rate, which made them conclude most species had their mtEve 200k years ago.

The million dollar question is:  at what rate does purifying selection filter out mutations to mtDNA?  Having 95-97% of mtDNA nucleotides subject to selection seems high even from a creationist standpoint.  But having none of them filtered by selection (as Nathaniel Jeanson's numbers imply, IIRC) seems too low.  Unfortunately I haven't read enough to even know if we we have good data on the rate of mtDNA purifying selection.

&gt; You haven't shown this. How does population genetics predict that every relevant phenotypic difference between these species should have reached fixation in a matter of decades? And where do you see historical evidence for a geographic spread? They both appear all over the Middle East.

What I mean is that if you take the assumptions of:

1.  highly heterozygous founding populations of the biblical founding population sizes of 2 to 7.
2.  Rapid geographical disperal as described in the bible.

Then applying what we know from population genetics, it's expected that new phenotypically distinct subpopulations would arise in a matter of centuries, if not decades.

&gt; You say the molecular clock differences accumulate over the past 4000 years (I'm not sure why you make that concession - couldn't that be created heterozygosity too?) so that's simply resolved by DNA-testing archaeological equid remains, isn't it?

Yes.  Biblically we'd expect to see ancient horses, donkeys, and zebras to have nearly identical mtDNA.",1579391839

&gt;clinically important antibiotic by a factor of 100,000. 

The ""-ase"" prefix after in Beta-lactamase means it is an enzyme.  The 5 simultaneous mutations will result in the reaction that beta-lactamase catalyzes will happen 100,000 times faster.

The use a cumulative selection scenario were we fix one mutation and do another round of mutation until they get the requisite 5 mutations in place.

They actually explore all possible ways of doing this with:

5-factorial = 120

If they didn't have this sequential evolution, the odds of random chance doing this would be:

1 out of 20^5 = 3,200,000

They point out:

&gt;some of the mutations do not increase cefotaxime resistance
on all allelic backgrounds. Rather, four mutations have negligible or even negative effects on drug resistance in some combinations

Using a phrase I don't like using, the 5-mutations required for the improvement makes the improvement Irreducibly Complex -- but I hate that phrase. It requires all 5 mutations to pretty much be in place simultaneously!

BUT, this paper was in the right direction and that was 14-years ago.  A lot of developments since have helped strenghthen the case, namely, STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY.

The reason STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY is making a difference now is that we have better X-ray crystallography, better Cryogenic Electron Microscopy, better protein fold modelling, etc.

We can now see that the problem is like nuts fitting a bolt, or parts simply interlocking together, or passwords have the right spelling.  We can clearly see this now in the flood of 3D-diagrams showing how proteins must interlock together like parts of a Boeing 747 jetliner.  If we can attach a working wing with working ailerons to the plane, if we can attach the tail parts -- HECK if we can't attach a tires to the landing gear, the 747 won't fly!

Now with structural biology, this is visually apparent rather than these abstract counting games.  That paper was huge, and

I think this old notion of vestigiality was debunked decades ago, but is still used as an 'argument' for evolution. The perception is often slow to catch up with the facts.  

""*The 'vestigial organ' argument uses as a premise the assertion that the organ in question has no function. There is no way however, in which this negative assertion can be arrived at scientifically. That is, one can not prove that something does not exist (in this case a certain function), since of course if it does not exist one cannot observe it, and therefore one can say nothing about it scientifically. The best we can do is to state that despite diligent effort, no function was discovered for a given organ. However it may be that some future investigator will the discover the function. Consequently, the vestigial organ argument has as a premise, either a statement of ignorance (I couldn't identify the function), or a scientifically invalid claim (it does not have a function). Such an argument, from ignorance, or from negative results, is not valid scientifically, and has no place in observational or experimental science.*

I'm quoting this, not because I mind at all, but for future reference when creationists complain this kind of patronising language comes only from the evolutionist side. Creationists too often talk as if they're exclusively sinned against and, given the cycle of antagonism going on, that's part of the problem.

Anyway, to address your argument, several points.

&gt;I've been discussing evolution and creation with people for about 15 years now, and easily 95% of the time evolutionists will ultimately completely disregard any argument about how impossible evolution is or how poorly it fits with the actual evidence by defaulting back on ""but every scientist says..."".

I'll put myself in the 5% then. I agree that this would be a very poor way to shut down an argument.

However, I think as a personal heuristic for what side is most likely to be correct - *not* as an argument in a debate - it's valid to the extent that the consensus view of almost everyone who has devoted their careers to studying the evidence on a particular topic pretty much *must* be more likely to be true than false. And since one cannot personally study every relevant subfield, this is sometimes a necessary shortcut.

Now that's where your simulation hypothesis analogy completely breaks down. Firstly, it's a speculative idea commanding nothing even *approaching* consensus. Secondly, it's not really an empirical idea, and you may find that people who are rather keen on consensus in empirical, evidence-based fields are quite willing to ignore it completely when it comes to philosophical or purely logical argument.

Similarly, the factors that cause arches to collapse are incredibly relevant in determining whether a cluster of collapses is in any way significant. The article says nothing about these factors.

To take an extreme example, if someone dropped a nuclear bomb on the Arches National Park and they *all* collapsed, that would give us *no* information about the age of the arches.

Though birds and oviraptosaurs may have shared a common ancestor, there is no evidence for this. Any extrapolation backwards would have to previously assume that bird evolution is fact, which is a circular argument. Also, notice how ‘selective’ the fossil record is... preserving all of the end tips of the family tree, and *never* preserving those at the branching off points. So, there is no evidence of them sharing a common ancestor, and the temporal paradox is therefore valid.

For slide 29, I admit that your image immediately struck me as disproving my feathered dino argument. However, I then noticed a detail: the feathers were symmetrical, which could possibly identify this as not a dinosaur, but a secondarily flightless bird like Protarchaeopteryx or Caudipteryx. Could you identify what dinosaur fossil this was taken off of? Also, the image looks like it was not found preserved in rock, but in amber perhaps... does this mean that the feathers were not found in conjunction with a dino fossil?

Slide 26 needs fixing - it's just the ""If we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" argument rephrased. The oviraptosaurs pictured in the figure are not the ancestors of birds. Instead, they shared a common ancestor with birds. There is nothing logically inconsistent here.

In slide 27, Protoavis is generally regarded as a chimera. Only one damaged, fragmentary specimen was found, and the interpretation of Protoavis as a bird is usually rejected.

Slide 28 is pretty problematic too. We've found dinosaurs with feathers and fluff, I don't think you can argue that they're all weighed down by scales (besides which, there are modern reptiles with thin skin as well). As well, studies show all dinosaurs (even non-feathered dinosaurs) likely had a bird-like lung, affixed to the top of the thoracic cavity. As well, many dinosaurs have been found with hollow bones (including distinctly un-birdlike dinosaurs, such as sauropods).

Slide 29 is an unusual argument. Here's feathers from a coelurosaurian (same family as T-rex). [IMAGE](https://imgur.com/ZzdoP8F). I'm not convinced that these are internal collagen. Some coelurosaurids even possessed both scales and feathers.",1579298917

&gt;Conscious experience seems to have  very large causes, though.  Dualism under weak functionalism doesn't  account for these effects.

The cause is God creating your conscious and tying it to your body. The mind controls the body and changes to the body can effect the feelings of the mind. Most good feelings are tied to biologically and socially good things and most bad feelings are tied to biologically and socially bad things. These ties are not set in stone though and can vary from different people, though probably not by much.

&gt; We also have the new problem that physical laws are no longer governing  the functions of the brain, even when energy is conserved.  This is  arguably just as bad, and not something neurologists have observed.

t1_femadzc,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt; At worst I'm putting it ""on par"" with other sources of data, but even then the Bible is unique [EDIT: and primary] because it is divinely inspired, preserved, and illuminated, while other scientific instruments are fallible.

This sentence is a self-contradiction. The Bible cannot be on par AND primary.

&gt;I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. 

That's nice that you say that, but clearly in practice you don't really abide by this. Otherwise you would already have abandoned deep time and death before sin.

&gt;One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

Oh dear. It's just as bad as I thought. There is apparently not a single example of any theologian, Christian or Jewish, in the thousands of years prior to Kline that has had this revelation on how to creatively interpret Gen 3:8... how sad.

&gt;end times are completion times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed

Please see the following article:
https://creation.com/new-earth

&gt;""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

No, there was not a future promise. Adam and Eve already had access to the Tree of Life and would have kept that access if they had not sinned. Narratively, Gen 3:8 comes before God had even recognized the sin of Adam and Eve and addressed it. Therefore again it is completely out of place to start bringing in a concept that the Bible itself does not mention until all the way in Isaiah (!) that has literally nothing at all to do with this, except for Kline's highly convoluted and novel attempts to avoid an 'unpleasant' idea (to him) that God was walking in the cool of the day.

&gt;So...the Bible does give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

Without the axioms of Christianity there is no epistemology at all. If we evolved randomly we have no claim to even the ability to know things. There's no way to even get started. The Christian worldview provides the understanding of the universe which is prerequisite for doing science.

&gt;I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis. 

It's more than the least speculative, it's the direct teaching of Scripture. And here is where you deserve to be raked over the coals for sheer dishonesty, because while you make a pretense of responding point by point, you obviously skip a very crucial point and make no reference to the fact that I have shown you no less than three separate places where Scripture explicitly shows a literal historical reading of Gen 1-11 is intended. And you have ignored this. If you really want to let Scripture interpret Scripture, then you'll have no choice but to become YEC, just as every single theologian was prior to ""modern science"" telling them they had to change their views of the Bible.

t1_felnj22,Thoguth,"Well, I can't really say that it answers a question I have. I have encountered the observation that empiricism is fundamentally circular and usefulness-backed before, and read at least a few books trying to defend it, but seeing it as circular and utility-backed suffices o explain how it behaves, giving all the explanatory power that I need, and leaving no open questions except for why people who consider themselves empiricists aren't satisfied agreeing with me. From many discussions I have had and books I have indulged in searching for that answer, that part is very adequately explained by cognitive dissonance in the writer and purchaser of the book.

For you, is this something new? Did you know that that for people who approach it as skeptics, the view you consider rock solid and obvious appears circular and fundamentally incapable of arbiting truth by itself, and that without resorting to a chapter in a book you once found convincing, you don't appear to have a convincing explanation for why is not?

I looked at some meta info about that book. One of the things that I thought worth noting was that the author uses information theory and has a view that is emergent, rather than reductionist. The other is that he appears to hold the many-worlds method of resolving quantum paradoxes.

I think that in the same way one can look at ten fingers and see a thousand numbers, one can look at the Universe and see a consciousness and a will. The same philosophical mechanism (not empiricism) that enables a limited set of your neurons to hold the true idea of a consciousness called ""you"" enables the limited set of neurons in a human mind to be aware of a consciousness greater than a human mind. Such a consciousness by itself is more Deistic or Panentheistic than it would be a direct correlate with the God of Christianity, but it is about as defensible a concept as any other consciousness, and it's not a big leap to say that consciousness is what established the universe... a Creator.",1579265679

One day I left a laptop in a locked stadium.  I needed the laptop for work the next day.  There were literally locked iron gates on the doors.

I prayed - ""Hey Dad, I need that laptop.  Make the crooked places straight and cut in sunder the bars of iron.""

Into my mind popped something I always tell people:  ""Faith is belief in action.  Have faith that God will do what you ask, and then do what you do so He can make it happen.""

I started walking around the stadium, past locked iron gate after locked iron gate.  In the middle of the third time around, one of the gates opened.  A security guard I had met just before that day's game poked his head out.  I told him I left the laptop inside the park, and he let me in to retrieve it.

t1_fekzu2u,37o4,"&gt; This methodology does irreparable damage to the Bible by placing the Bible in a subservient role to what you are calling ""evidence"" from outside sources, which are in fact anti-Biblical scientific ""authorities"" and their pronouncements.

Science isn't anti-Bible, that's an incoherent claim. And I'm not putting the Bible in a subservient role. At worst I'm putting it ""on par"" with other sources of data, but even then the Bible is unique because it is divinely inspired, preserved, and illuminated, while other scientific instruments are fallible.

&gt; The propositional revelation in the Bible stands on its own merit and cannot be overruled by any human authority or consensus view.

I agree! And if push comes to shove it has to be the Bible that wins out. But if I'm going to do good science I have to proceed according to the methodologies and programs most beneficial to advancement in the kind of science I am doing. If the resultant data seems to be in conflict with the Bible, the way forward is (1) collect more data, (2) study the Bible more, and (3) revisit and revise the theories. I have to operate on the axiom that there can't be contradiction between good theology and good science if I'm going to get anywhere as a Christian scientist.

&gt; The plain meaning is not a ""folk"" interpretation. That's quite an arrogant thing to state. Can you name any ancient Jewish or Christian theologians who viewed Genesis 3:8 eschatologically? Or is this a brand new idea that Kline feels he is the first person in history smart enough to figure out?

One of the problems that Kline had was that he often felt that he was a pair of ""fresh eyes"" on the text, which means that he often felt little need to ground his theories explicitly in the tradition. But, as I'm about to explain, the premise he was elaborating on is absolutely an established part of the tradition.

&gt; It's hard for me to understand how Kline failed to realize that eschatology is the study of end times, and that end times can only happen with relation to the overall scope of history which really only took its shape and form after the Fall and the Curse. End times are restoration times, and before the Curse there was nothing that needed any restoring.

You're making an enormous Biblical-theological claim here, which may be right (though even then it certainly extends beyond talk of superficial ""plain meaning""s) but which I completely disagree with: end times are **completion** times, and prior to the Fall there were still things to be completed. As Geerhardus Vos keenly put it, ""eschatology precedes soteriology"" - a rule that has become normative in Reformed theology more broadly. And this is just an elaboration on the traditional distinction between the covenant of works (prelapsarian Adam and Christ) and the covenant of grace (postlapsarian Adam and all who are justified in Christ). For example:

1. What was the point of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (hint: what does knowing ""good and evil"" mean in the canonical context)?
2. What was the point of the tree of life (hint: how do we get to eat from it ... where else does it show up in the canon)?
3. What was the point of Jesus completing the ""first Adam""'s work if there was nothing for Adam to complete in the garden in the first place (or, if Jesus did not complete the first Adam's work, where do we stand before God)?
4. Why is the ""new heavens and the new earth"" so different from the original creation?

Now of course, you can reject the works/grace distinction or even the active obedience of Christ, but only at great risk to your entire soteriology.

Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why I have no problem with animal death before the Fall - the Garden was not the ""new heavens and the new earth,"" it was probationary, and animal death served as a sign of the threatened covenant curse (""on the day that you eat of it, you will surely die"" - how did Adam even know what death was, anyway?).

&gt; The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.

""On the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."" There was a law given in the Garden, a curse promised upon failure to keep it, and a future blessing (the tree of life) promised upon success.

&gt; No, the Bible does not give us the Scientific Method. Why should it? The Bible is propositional revelation from God. It is simply to be believed. However, God does say, ""It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out."" (Proverbs 25:2), so there is certainly a Biblical basis for doing science.
&gt;
&gt; But in the process of doing science, we can never arrive at ""truth"" that would contradict God's revealed truth, lest God be shown to be a liar.

Amen.

&gt; Science cannot be done properly except from the foundation of the Christian worldview, and that worldview cannot contradict itself.

So...the Bible *does* give a methodology for science? Or how else do we do science with a ""Christian worldview""? Maybe in terms of axiology, but epistemology?

&gt; All human claims that such-and-such evidence ""contradicts the Bible"" are based upon wrong interpretations of said evidence.

Or wrong interpretations of the Bible.

&gt; The Bible is not a science textbook, but it does make many statements with both scientific and historical implications. If you are truly an inerrantist as you claim, then you will always side with the Bible if there is a conflict between manmade ideas

Amen.

&gt; (like evolution and deep time) and the clear teachings of the Bible. You already conceded that young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture, so can you remind me why you have apparently chosen to disbelieve it anyway?

I have not conceded that ""young cosmos is the teaching of Scripture,"" I have proposed that **given the Biblical text with no modern scientific evidences, Greek philosophical commitments (e.g. Augustine), etc., young cosmos is the least speculative hypothesis**. I certainly don't believe that ""deep time"" conflicts with the ""clear teachings of the Bible,"" and I also believe that there are some innocent models of evolution (possibly excluding human common descent) which have no conflict with the text as well.

&gt; And by the way, did you read the article I linked to you about the Biblical minimum and maximum age of the earth?

A self splicing RNA exists. 

It is advantageous to improve efficiency/specificity/etc

A chaperone evolves, either through de novo means or, more likely, through another RNA binding catalyst that improves splicing efficiency. Repeat step as pressures exist. 

Splisosome function sans catalyst is deleterious either to low efficiency, specificity, etc

Nope.  They just assume it, they don't do any estimates from first principles of physics and chemistry.  It's pure faith.

In other words, Kline has committed a giant theological anachronism by suggesting an eschatological reading of a verse that came before the Curse!  The Day of the Lord to which Kline refers would not have been referenced prior to the Curse, and in fact I would argue it could not logically be referenced prior to the giving of the law, either. Why? Because, as Paul writes, ""Where there is no law there is no transgression."" (Romans 4). The Day of the Lord is about God's wrath in judging the evil doer and restoring all things to their former perfection; but God cannot righteously judge if God has not even revealed the law, which is the basis for God's judging in the first place.

t1_fekguwg,Thoguth,"Well, you test it something is experimentally valid as reliable by evaluating it against other things you consider reliable. To some degree empiricism becomes circular and self-reinforcing that way, doesn't it?

Not sure why that entire kit would not potentially also be relevant to things observed to be divinely revealed. If it supports itself self-referentially and it's property useful, it seems like the process for considering it truth is identical to materialistic empiricism.

The reason it's important to understand this is that Azusfan's complaint is that he is not taken seriously in scientific debates.  If you want to be taken seriously in scientific debates then you have to adhere to the rules of science, and one of the rules of science is that evidence against one hypothesis is NOT necessarily evidence FOR a competing hypothesis.

It's hard not to read that as if part of your foundational assumptions include the idea that ""divine revelation"" cannot be considered evidence. But if it can be observed, then it could be, could it not?

Hmm... It also seems like you might have a view that seems worth probing. In that part it looks like you said the foundational assumption is that only evidence and experiment can determine truth, but then you said that foundational assumptions are de-facto truth, but are evaluated by utility, not empiricism (although the quantity of things deemed useful can be empirical, the actual utility is intrinsically something else).

You should not enter into debates like that expecting to win people over with a great argument. That’s not how it works. Jesus himself could write a scientific paper explaining exactly how he designed the universe, and it won’t matter unless God softens their hearts.

t1_feic6ok,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

Wait just a sec, let's roll back to your previous comment where you stated:  


&gt; **I would probably be willing to concede that that's what the Bible teaches** ***ceteris paribus*****.** 

Can you then not answer your own question? You have already agreed that the plain meaning of the text (when outside factors such as secular cosmology, archaeology, etc, are not considered) indicates a young cosmos. Don't try to backtrack and start mincing words. If the words of the Bible don't, at least in the most important and fundamental areas, have a ""clear and plain meaning"", then Christianity must be reduced to gnosticism, and the Bible to a Ouija board.  


&gt; What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?   


Of course I disagree! That's like saying ""if you have any margin of error whatsoever, then you know nothing.""  


&gt; I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible. 

It just so happens that the precise chronology of the Bible has been worked out to within the acceptable limits of interpretive freedom. You can read all about that here:  


 [https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth](https://creation.com/biblical-age-of-the-earth) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""\[God\] would visit \[Adam and Eve\] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day \[that is, the Day of the Lord\]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden. 

So if any sophist comes up and gives a complicated justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the words in any place, that gives us license to disregard it? This ""exegete"" is not prepared to accept the plain meaning because, apparently, it's too incredible for her:  


**""Are we really prepared to accept the anthropomorphism of the Lord’s seeking the relief that might be afforded by the evening air from the burden of the day?""**  


I wonder if Kline is also similarly unprepared to accept the anthropomorphism of angels who eat with Abraham, or Jesus who became a man?  


We can all do without such faithless sophistry. The text states they ""heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the cool of the day."" And that's exactly what I believe happened. I don't need to understand something fully to accept it. That's what faith means, at least in part. If you are unwilling to accept something on the grounds that you don't understand it, you are placing yourself in the ranks of the scoffers. Scripture tells us of many great truths that we cannot yet understand. In some way God took a physical form and was able to walk and enjoy the cool of the day.",1579183407
t1_fejjc7d,lisper,"&gt; The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why?

No, they applied a working hypothesis that scientists would not engage in fraud because, if they did, that fraud would eventually be uncovered (which it was) and so the perpetrators would have nothing to gain.  That hypothesis turned out to be wrong, as scientific hypotheses often do.  It had nothing to do with ""childlike faith.""

&gt; This isn't a debate sub. You are not required to respond to any of it.

Yes, I know that.  I am not here to debate (though I'm happy to do so if someone wants to engage).  I'm here to learn.  But let me be clear what I am here to learn: my main interest is to understand how people maintain beliefs in things that to me seem plainly false.  I understand that better now than I did when I started this project, but I would not yet say that I have a full understanding of it.  In particular, I don't understand what you meant when you wrote:

&gt; Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table...

so I thought the quickest way to come to a better understanding was to ask for an example.  It's not because I'm ""innocent of the driven snow"", it's simply becuase I don't understand what you meant.  I can *guess*, but my guess could be wrong so I'd rather just go to the source.",1579182336
t1_feim27t,PaulDouglasPrice,"&gt;That doesn't imply every passage be understood as depicting literal scientific facts.

&gt;Nicodemus didn't realise this wasn't a scientifically literal rebirth, it's still theologically true.

Why is it true? Because of the **fact of the Fall.** If there was no real Fall, then there is also no real need to be born again.  


&gt; It's certainly plausible that Genesis intends to communicate literal/physical/chronological/scientific facts in its early chapters, but theological truth needn't always be based on literal let alone scientific intent of communication. 

It is not only plausible, it is the only acceptable and proper way to read the text. The whole rest of Scripture refers back to it as literal true history.",1579181809

Many evolutionists believed in Piltdown Man for 40 years, before it was revealed to be a hoax. The evolutionists had childlike faith that the good scientist wouldn't have intentionally scammed them for 40 years! Why? How? Because they WANTED to believe. If you want to believe, then a little hiccup like a believing in a few falsehoods won't really matter. For a Christian example, I am sure that orthodox Southern Baptist believe in a few falsehoods, especially with regard to priorities. My Pastor is nice, but his sermons are focused on how hard it is to be a perfect Christian and then he asks for people to become Christians. That's his formula. It's pretty much the worst sales pitch I've ever heard, and it is the same every Sunday. I would rate them as damaging to the faith. One time, JD Greer visited and preached and that was a breath of fresh air. I used to be Presbyterian (many more falsehoods) before switching to Southern Baptist. The bottom line is that falsehoods are every where, but... ""let God be true, and every man a liar.""

t3_emxmx6,Thoguth,"&gt;For those of you who don't already know me, I'm an atheist who hangs out here because I think it's important to try to understand points of view with which one disagrees.

If sincere, that puts you ahead of most Internet atheists I have known.

I hope you're taking care that ""sincere, polite questions"" and ""matter-of-fact observation"" can easily creep into uninvited proselytization of your own views. If you sincerely just want to learn, my sincere encouragement would be to spend more time reading with an open mind and maybe less probing or contradicting interactions, at least outside of places constructed for those interactions.

Like this question... Why were you in an exchange with someone about True Christianity? And why do you equate that with Creationism? You can be a Muslim or Zoroastrian creationist, or even believe in some sort of creationism that involves no Deity (as the answer to Asimov's *The Last Question*)

To answer the guy's question about *True Christianity*, I would sort of say he's right, because Jesus said lots of people will not make it. Even if 100% of the world were nominally Christian, they would not be ""true Christians"" in the sense of Jesus' ""narrow way"", that's correct, it would invalidate His words, but I personally think it's incredibly unlikely because actually following Jesus for real is *really dang hard*. It's way easier to be a casual, part-time Christian or a hypocritical self-righteous one than to be a sincere follower of Jesus teachings and example.

What does that have to do with Creationism though?",1579145915
t1_feh9l6i,Thoguth,"&gt;First, there is no ""narrowly-defined subset of evidence"" that is the ultimate arbiter of scientific truth. To be accepted, a scientific theory has to be consistent with all of the evidence no matter its source.

When most strident atheists use the term ""evidence"", they don't mean all the things that can be convincing, they mean something special and more specific. If you are skeptical of this, try talking to them about things widely recognized by religious believers as evidence for what they believe in. In practice, it's a subset, which does not include conflicting measurement, personal testimony, documented events, or even input from their own senses if that input contradicts what their pre-existing view. Many things that would be called evidence in a historical context, in a philosophical context, a judicial context, or a practical context, are off the table for the type of almost you most often find trying to prove something on the Internet. They tend to prove their own insecurities and emotionality, dramatically (and somewhat tragically) in contrast to the detached scienctific neutrality of which they are a cargo cult.

&gt;Second, foundational assumptions are always true by definition. The only way to judge a foundational assumption is by its utility.

Wow, this is a breath of fresh air. I have spent an inordinate amount of back and forth with someone recently who seems so close to understanding this but just doesn't get it.

&gt;That is essentially what has brought us modern technological civilization. 

This is reductive, though. Empirical iteration has improved our understanding of many things that have enabled us to be more effective, but without more basic civilization-sustaining practices like morality, motivation, and social connection, we would have no civilization to be technological. The recent fad of attempting to discard or reverse foundational assumptions that created languages, nations and cultures because they're (falsely) seen as contradictory to ones that created SD cards, is tremendously short-sighted and fundamentally illogical.",1579144224

Heretic!  ;-)

&gt; Mark 9:24

I'm already familiar with that passage.  I don't see how it's relevant.  If God exists then He knows I seek the truth, and He also knows what kind of evidence I need in order to accept something as the truth (unless, of course, he is as willfully ignorant of the present as He is about the future).  He could easily provide that evidence if He chose to (assuming of course that He's omnipotent) but He hasn't.  So at least some of the story I've been told about God must be false.  Since I have no reason to give any more credence to one part of it over the other, I reject it all (contingent to getting new information of course).

What I am saying is (precisely): *if* Scripture leaves ""uncertainty in the exact timing"" of Genesis 1-11, *then* in principle ""millions or billions of years"" may be postulated. Do you disagree?

Note that you may disagree about the truth of the antecedent without disagreeing about the truth of the entire proposition.

&gt; Evidences don't interpret themselves.

That is true, but they are not necessarily interpreted by the Bible. The Bible may *present* to us historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological hypotheses, but does it tell us *how to do* historical, archaeological, geological, and cosmological science?

To engage with a particular quote from the article you linked:

&gt; For example, if this were correct, then only those with knowledge of modern science could rightly interpret the Bible. Also, since scientific ideas are constantly changing, then the Bible’s message would be constantly changing, from century to century.

This seems to me to be an enormous overstatement. I would need to see an argument for why the precise or estimated chronology of Biblical events may not be adjusted (at all?) due to new historical, archaeological, geological, cosmological, etc. evidences without changing the ""message"" of the Bible.

&gt; [...] you are allowing the clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible to be overruled [...]

Please define ""clear and plain meaning of the words of the Bible.""

As an extended counter-example, the article you linked uses Genesis 3:8 to justify the (propositional!) claim that ""[God] would visit [Adam and Eve] during the cool of the day to share fellowship."" However, that is by no means the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 3:8. For example, Meredith Kline [suggests](https://meredithkline.com/klines-works/articles-and-essays/primal-parousia/) an eschatological reading of 3:8a along the lines of ""They heard the sound of Yahweh God traversing the garden as the Spirit of the day [that is, the Day of the Lord]."" On this reading (which is not arbitrary, but based on an extensive Biblical-theological understanding of Hebrew phrases like ""qol yhwh"" and ""ruach hayom""), no particular information is given regarding the ""afternoon fellowship"" that interpreters have been wont to attribute the state of man in the Garden.

My only point is that ""clear and plain meaning"" is in my opinion an incoherent concept, especially when applied comprehensively to ""the Bible"" in its entirety (the Westminster Confession of Faith, for example, says that ""all things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all,"" and I would concur). I think that letting the ""clear and plain meaning"" of Genesis 1-11 do this much heavy lifting for you is a recipe for disaster.",1579135083

God's omniscience must be in coherent understanding with all Scripture, and by God's own admission, in His own words, He says that he did not foresee that His people would engage in the child-sacrifice practices of the surrounding cultures. He also was grieved at how evil Adam's offspring turned out to be before the Flood. This seems to suggest that while God has the power to see the future, He does not look at it constantly and some future events surprise and disappoint him, which makes the inverse true: some future events surprise and delight Him (like your repentance, hehe).

You confuse beliefs about what gave rise to the natural world (a religious belief) with the scientific knowledge we have about the way things are.  To the extent that evolutionists practice science (and they do), they are generating data that, first and foremost, tells us about the way things are in the present; and thereby we can say various things about the way things will be in the future.  And that is always very valuable.

To the extent that those beliefs about the past (which cannot be tested or repeated) yield testable and successful predictions about the way the world will be found to be, alternative views about the past, properly understood, yield the same predictions.  I am aware of several predictions that UCD believers would not have made, or made incorrectly, whereas YEC yielded true predictions: for example, UCD believers held to spontaneous generation until they were corrected by a YEC.  UCD believers would not have predicted that we would be finding soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, and yet, here we are.  UCD believers taught doctors to yank out healthy appendixes during cesareans because they were ""vestigial"".  UCD believers predicted that ethnic differences amounted to a division of races into higher and lower.  

At any rate, that's not even the same kind of ""predictive success"" that I was attributing to the scientific method.  The scientific method allows us to know how things will behave in specific circumstances; thus by contriving those circumstances, we can predict how those things will behave.  Belief in an old earth and universal common descent don't allow us to do that in anything approaching the same way.  The failures of UCD beliefs are far more harmful than the kinds of failures to which the scientific method are prone.

At any rate, I am interested to know what kind of predictions one would make on the basis of attributing the state of the natural world to blind, accidental forces combined with natural selection; which would not be made, or would be made wrongly on the basis of attributing the state of the natural world to the special, intelligent creation by a common designer?",1579101329

The only way around this is to say that God did not directly control anything, but he just superintended the process from afar (which would be deism, not theism).",1578951831

Only indirectly. Theism states that God acts miraculously and created miraculously.

Maybe I am misunderstanding and maybe you would claim that life is different than non-life, but essentially you are claiming, if this is correct, that God knows everything that will happen?

If this is the case then every interaction down to the most sub-atomic particle is pre-destined and people have no free will.

t1_fdv677n,NanoRancor,"&gt;1. The Creator does not view death, suffering, or decay with dread, like we do, but has seen fit to use this phenomenon for His purposes. What seems 'bad!' to us could be a process for good.
2. Or, as some have concluded/accused, the Creator is pleased by death, suffering, and corruption, and takes sadistic pleasure in them.

Except that God is infinite in each aspect of himself, including a relationship with man, and we can judge from the moral law he has handed us that infinite relationship would mean infinite love and goodness. 

&gt;4. Or, there could be other forces, or factors, that have temporarily (or permanently) confounded the original purposes of the Creator.

This can't be true, for as i said, anything that immutes, confounds, divides or otherwise degrades the infinity of God cannot be. There cannot be polytheism, as it cuts the nature of God into many. The trinity sidesteps this as it is the character of God and not the being and nature of God which is split.

I suppose i should've included this, but The real reason there is death, flawed humanity, and a dying world, comes logically from the nature of God. If God is infinite Good, essentially perfect, then would not whatever he makes be perfect? And yet it is not. So how do you get imperfection from perfection? Freedom of choice. Just as it is not fate or free will which will save us, it was not quite either which doomed us. Rather, it was an aligning of will with that of the devil.

&gt;The possibilities are too numerous, to conclude a specific trait about the Creator. There is only speculation as to 'Why?' The Creator allows or uses this phenomenon of corruption.  

&gt;A conclusion of mystery, regarding the Creator, remains.

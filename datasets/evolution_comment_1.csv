Actually they happen randomly in the gametes.  This builds diversity in the population over time.

&gt;how is its body able to ""understand""

It doesn't.  Birds with longer beaks are more likely to survive and pass on the trait to offspring in this case.  In each successive generation, the shorter and shorter beaked individuals are less represented in the population.  Over time, this simultaneous process of increasing diversity with differential survival/reproduction results in a shaping of the representative population.

t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"Simply put, every characteristic has a distribution with an average and a spread. So say beak length is 5 cm, with a +-10% spread. So there are always birds with a beak of 4,5 cm and 5,5 cm. Now, if a longer beak is beneficial, the 5,5 cm beak will become the new norm, but more importantly, the new average, simply because the birds with a 5,5 cm beak will breed and survive more successfully than the others.

But, the +/- 10% spread does not go away, so at a certain point, the average is 5,5 but the spread is from 5 to 6. If a longer beak is still beneficial, the average will move up again, but again with the spread. This continues until it becomes self limiting, basically when the average becomes the optimum.",1580234174
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"Not only the beneficial mutations happen. All sorts of mutations happen. Birds are born with shorter beaks sometimes and longer beaks other times.

If longer beaks to reach worms deeper in a tree hole are more beneficial then the ones who happen to be born with longer beaks will get more worms, allowing them to survive longer and produce more offspring, who will inherit their long-beak mutation. The birds with shorter beaks won't get as many worms, so their short-beak mutations will tend to go extinct. This is natural selection.

Adaptation is the combined process of random mutations followed by natural selection like this.

(Evolution is sometimes more complex than adaptation though. What if those short-beaked birds happened to be born in a forest that has a lot more worms overall? Even though they could have gotten *even more* if they had long beaks, they might still get more than the long-beak birds in a forest with fewer worms. This can make the short-beak mutation spread more than the long-beak mutation even though it's not ""adaptive,"" just because of the luck of living in a forest with a lot of worms. This kind of evolution is called genetic drift.)",1580232985
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"There are 3 conditions that have to be met for evolution through natural selection to happen.

First, there needs to be variation in the trait (in your example beak size, meaning that even birds within the same species differ slightly in how long their beaks are).

Second, the trait has to be heritable. Meaning that parents with slightly longer beaks will also have offspring with slightly longer beaks.

Third, the differences in the trait have to result in fitness differences.

Going back to your example. In your population some birds will have slightly longer beaks than others (variation) and they will be able to eat food hidden in tree holes, that is not accessible for the birds with shorter beaks. More food means they have more energy to invest in survival and reproduction (increased fitness) and therefore will have more offspring compared to the other short-beaked birds. Their offspring will inherit the longer beaks (heritability) resulting in a population with more long-beaked birds in the next generation.

No ""intention"" or ""understanding"" is therefore needed.",1580232658
t1_ffu0lh0,t3_ev89ja,"And then the birds who happen to get good random mutations have easier life and thus more likely to reproduce, increasing the likelihood of their kids to also have that feature, and the ones with short beaks are less likely to survive and reproduce, suppressing the passing of the bad trait to the next generation. Okay now it's all clear.",1580232457
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"I think the idea of mutations leading to adaptation (while mostly correct) can be a little misleading.

Think instead about a population of birds. Each bird is slightly different from the others. One might have slightly longer wings than the rest, one might have longer legs, one might have a particularly long beak...If you measure traits like these in a population of organisms, you will find this kind of variability and that is what natural selection acts upon.

It's not really plausible that this one bird with the longer beak just happened to have a mutation that made his beak slightly longer than the rest. Rather, beak size is probably the result of an interaction of several genes. The particular combination this bird received came from his parents, which they got from their parents...so through reproduction, new combinations of these genes are always popping up. And in those genes is a whole history of mutations that occurred all along the lineage leading up to that bird.

So, natural selection acts on the existing variation in a trait. That variation comes from individual differences in genetics that come about from mutations and the mixing and matching of genes that occurs during reproduction.",1580232427

The Holocene extinction, otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction, is an  ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch (with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene) as a result of human activity. The included extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna, starting at the end of the last Ice Age.

t1_ffrq0iu,t3_etnwn5,"Not particularly, because my writing ability is pretty horrible, but my usage and applications is good enough for the teacher's standard I guess. I'll basically give a rundown of key aspects my paper examined however, and you can feel free to critique it as you would. The whole paper was brain size to intelligence, so it wasn't specific to humans and apes in particular, as I also examined instances where humans may have a larger or smaller part of the brain, being  gray matter in the prefrontal area, due to exposure of lead in childhood. I also mention the size of crustaceans having very large brains in proportion to their size, but largely not being intelligent creatures. In it I found that humans actually have a brain size much larger than it should be. Part of my paper examined the diversion of humans from apes, being that scientists estimate 150 million neurons were being added every one hundred thousand years, which if you decide to do how many were being added a year, which I'm not sure if there would be a difference, besides maybe intelligence being estimated to be genetic, and that each generation inherited an exponential difference of neurons. While humans brains were evolving, the volume of the brain tripled, having an approximate 1400 cubic centimeters, which is what we modern humans have today. Our white and gray brain matter also grew in size and we developed more complex cortical folding. Great apes have an average brain size sitting at around 350-450 cubic centimeters, while still displaying a similar brain organization pattern. This isn't word for word, and I'm largely paraphrasing because I can't copy and paste my paper here, because it is on my computer, not my phone, but this is the part where I examined the diversion of our intellectual diversions. And examining the cranial vault of Neanderthal skulls, scientists determined they had a 10% larger brain that humans do, but this was largely due to their incredibly large size, and needing a larger brain to function, so it quite possibly could have been smaller by a little bit, comparing pound for brain size. Humans also have a brain 3 times larger than it should be when you compare trends in the animals kingdom, so we have a larger brain in general. So I largely understand why our brains are different from our tree dwelling cousins,but what I don't understand is how so far humans are the only ones that gage developed an evolutionary stem of intelligence, seeing as how apes have existed far longer than us, and we've seen many traits evolve separately, being sight, as it is estimated to have come into existence in 5 separate times, being that 5 different organism would independently to grow sight.",1580165586

The Weberian apparatus, on the other hand, is made from modifications to the first four vertebrae. It's also unique to one group of ray finned fishes, the Ostariophysis.

To get a better picture the entire series from beginning to end provides a better picture on what you’re asking, if you actually want to know, but for a general overview- brains are useful at all in multicellular organisms that are mobile - so anything more advanced or like us than a worm. Then for a more advanced brain like those found in fish it comes down to predator-prey selective forces so that prey learn how to avoid being eaten while predators learn how to not starve to death.

t1_ffp392g,t3_eufi8l,"In wild species that have an established social order and evolutionary history that involves incest there are offnen no genetic issues other than lack of genetic diversity.

Inbreeding depression and the expression of deleterious genes tends to be mainly when a portion of a larger population forced into an inbreeding situation (as is the case with domestic animals).

In the wild small populations that have had been inbreeding for a long time (many generations) have often weeded out those bad genes.  There is still the issue of a lack of generic diversity though, which can be a problem if a disease enters the population or if environmental conditions change resulting in an inability of the species to evolve to meet the new environment due to said lack of diversity.

My current work is with a nearly extinct primate species that has been isolated on one small island for the last 12,000 years and during that entire time would have had a small population (although *much* larger than it is today).",1580128130
t1_ffpgjua,t3_euczqp,"Since the evolution of Homo Sapien Sapiens the human brain has not evolved. There has been genetic variation as there is with all animals but this is not a universal change across the species to be considered genetic change in the species homo sapiens.

Culture changes quite dramatically through zero impact from biology. Cultures are these constructs we have created that are almost creatures in themselves with their own changes and selection processes. The second world war had a profound effect in culture but it has no relation to any genetic changes in the human species. If you were to compare human brains from not to those of 1930s you will find no difference other than the standard genetic variance of a species.

OP omits from his rambling the biggest culture changes of recent times, the rise of computers and the Internet. Both of these occur in times of peace and stability.

t1_ffpol0t,t3_eu2kgf,"The fact that OToL lists its sources is definitely a major plus and leaves OneZoom more suspect (Though from the fact that many of the date values OneZoom gives are suspiciously similar to those of TimeTree, I would guess that it uses a similar method of aggregation.). I also like how in many areas it provides both supporting and conflicting papers for the arrangement of taxa shown.

I understand your point that identifying which taxa diverged first in a particularly ancient lineage is very difficult, but I’m sure you would agree that (at least in some instances) it is very important to get right. Whether ctenophores or poriferans diverged first has tremendous implications on how the earliest animals evolved. A similar example of a current dispute in how the topmost clades within a taxon diverged can be found within Dinosauria, where the relationships between ornithischians, theropods, sauropodomorphs, etc. may have a huge impact on whether the earliest dinosaurs had integument and/or air sacs, and thus may consequently inform us about the evolution, lifestyle, and physical properties of their descendants. It is for this reason that I took the ctenophore-poriferan relationship in OToL so seriously, especially as it does not even consider the topic a matter of debate (AFAIK, no conflicting sources are cited).

I feel that the best method of dealing with conflicts for any biota-wide phylogenetic tree project would be to add alternative (and likely but yet-to-be-confirmed with further research) placements for taxa in dotted lines, with the shade of the text getting ever lighter with weaker support before ceasing to exist upon crossing a certain threshold (e.g. Eocyte/Asgard hypothesis = dark grey, Ornithoscelida = lighter grey, Heilmann’s bird-thecodont hypothesis = not on chart). However, this may be hard to implement (especially for something like OneZoom) and has the potential to be a confusing mess in many heavily debated areas.",1580107423

Much more likely however is that irrational thoughts if an afterlife are the side-effect of how intelligence has in my OTHER aspects improved our survival. However reasonable the idea that you will be invaded by another tribe, it doesn’t happen every night. Yet, a fence will protect you every night. However reasonable the germ theory of disease, it’s not like we actually always wash of pathogens when we wash our hands. It’s just better to wash our hands irrationally frequent just in case. 

Our brain is in the do-whatever-it-takes-to-stay-alive business, especially since humans are pretty useful for the family and tribe even after reproductive age. When pondering about death, many people tend to “wash-their-hands-just-in-case”, like in the example above.",1580106273
t1_ffpfwj7,t3_euczqp,"&gt; His use of the US was just an example, you were pedantic on that point and ignored the valid point that the current state of conflict is not a recent development.

Then you are the one misreading, because I did not disagree with or ignore that point. I completely agree that it is not only a valid point but an important one. In fact it's not just that the state of conflict is not recent, the OP is objectively wrong in his claim. The world is more peaceful today (using a broad definition of ""today"") than it has ever been at any point in it's history. 

All I disagreed with was the framing the site the other poster linked to used, and that he repeated. It was misleading. Why should we exaggerate and say that ""the US has been at war for 222 of it's 239 years"" when that is really not true? They are using a highly misleading definition of ""at war"", and they consider even a single military engagement as being ""at war"" for an entire year. The real amount of time the US has been at war is bad enough, so why make it sound even worse than it really was?

Was I being pedantic? I don't know, maybe. But it seemed to me that the data was wrong in an important way, so I pointed it out. The fact that I agree with the conclusion doesn't mean I agree with sitting back and letting someone make a misleading claim.

t1_ffpfjtl,t3_eu2kgf,"TimeTree is definitely best for retrieving pairwise divergence estimates, not trees. One thing I like about the OToL project is that they published papers explaining their approach to reconciling parts of the tree where there was discord, it's probably the most transparent Tree of Life browser yet.

And I don't think that judging OToL by the ctenophores/sponges placement is a good barometer. The ""who diverged first in extant metazoans"" question is an absolute clusterfuck. It's an incredibly deep divergence and there are likely long branch attraction problems. Plus any time we try to do genome-scale phylogenetics, we have model misspecification issues, and when we throw in the half a billion years of divergence that only gets worse. So when the result one gets seems to largely boil down to what model is used, in a situation like this I think there's a lot of room for skepticism.",1580100442

t1_ffpf2fx,t3_euczqp,"First of all, it's definitely not the case that there has been no genetic changes affecting the human brain or behavioral traits for 100,000 years. I mean, there's obviously standing variation in the genetics of many behavioral traits for one. Any frequency changes among those variants are evolutionary. It's also likely that some variation has become fixed and other new variants have been introduced during that time as well. I don't know exactly what change you're referring to that you think happened 100,000 years ago, but it sounds pretty arbitrary.

Second, even if there was no genetic change, culture would still change since it's an interaction between genetics and environment. It's similar to any other genotype x environment interaction studied in population genetics in that genetics, environment, and the interaction effect between them represent three separate terms and you can't understand the changes without accounting for all three.",1580094506

That said, I do not see how it is measurably less reliable than the sources given by others. The Open Tree of Life, for example, recovers Ctenophores as the basalmost group within Metazoa despite the fact that the vast majority of studies do not support this. Additionally, while TimeTree works quite well in providing dates for the estimated divergence of clades, its attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships along those lines (especially those of larger groups with a multitude of rapidly diverging lineages, such as Aves and Eukaryotes) often produce results that conflict with virtually every recent study.",1580093798

t3_eufi8l,t3_eufi8l,"Yes, there are all kinds of inbreeding-avoidance heuristics that organisms have developed. It isn't just with mammals, but birds and fish as well.

In humans, one notable heuristic is sharing maternal attention (i.e., watching your mom care for another person). For example, adopted siblings have no attraction for each other as long as they were both raised as infants by the same mother. Of course, *genetically* they might be perfectly compatible, so one could argue that the mechanism ""misfires"" in this case from an evolutionary standpoint. 

Alternately, biological siblings never develop a visceral revulsion for each other if they were raised separately and never knew each other as siblings. I'm sure most siblings in this situation today decide not to make babies if they know they are siblings, but the decision won't be based on a gut feeling. It will be due to cultural reasons (e.g., norms against incest) or simply due to knowledge that the babies won't be healthy. Then again, there are definitely cases where siblings in this situation fall in love and just say ""Fuck it!"".

Actually they happen randomly in the gametes.  This builds diversity in the population over time.

&gt;how is its body able to ""understand""

It doesn't.  Birds with longer beaks are more likely to survive and pass on the trait to offspring in this case.  In each successive generation, the shorter and shorter beaked individuals are less represented in the population.  Over time, this simultaneous process of increasing diversity with differential survival/reproduction results in a shaping of the representative population.

t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"Simply put, every characteristic has a distribution with an average and a spread. So say beak length is 5 cm, with a +-10% spread. So there are always birds with a beak of 4,5 cm and 5,5 cm. Now, if a longer beak is beneficial, the 5,5 cm beak will become the new norm, but more importantly, the new average, simply because the birds with a 5,5 cm beak will breed and survive more successfully than the others.

But, the +/- 10% spread does not go away, so at a certain point, the average is 5,5 but the spread is from 5 to 6. If a longer beak is still beneficial, the average will move up again, but again with the spread. This continues until it becomes self limiting, basically when the average becomes the optimum.",1580234174
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"Not only the beneficial mutations happen. All sorts of mutations happen. Birds are born with shorter beaks sometimes and longer beaks other times.

If longer beaks to reach worms deeper in a tree hole are more beneficial then the ones who happen to be born with longer beaks will get more worms, allowing them to survive longer and produce more offspring, who will inherit their long-beak mutation. The birds with shorter beaks won't get as many worms, so their short-beak mutations will tend to go extinct. This is natural selection.

Adaptation is the combined process of random mutations followed by natural selection like this.

(Evolution is sometimes more complex than adaptation though. What if those short-beaked birds happened to be born in a forest that has a lot more worms overall? Even though they could have gotten *even more* if they had long beaks, they might still get more than the long-beak birds in a forest with fewer worms. This can make the short-beak mutation spread more than the long-beak mutation even though it's not ""adaptive,"" just because of the luck of living in a forest with a lot of worms. This kind of evolution is called genetic drift.)",1580232985
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"There are 3 conditions that have to be met for evolution through natural selection to happen.

First, there needs to be variation in the trait (in your example beak size, meaning that even birds within the same species differ slightly in how long their beaks are).

Second, the trait has to be heritable. Meaning that parents with slightly longer beaks will also have offspring with slightly longer beaks.

Third, the differences in the trait have to result in fitness differences.

Going back to your example. In your population some birds will have slightly longer beaks than others (variation) and they will be able to eat food hidden in tree holes, that is not accessible for the birds with shorter beaks. More food means they have more energy to invest in survival and reproduction (increased fitness) and therefore will have more offspring compared to the other short-beaked birds. Their offspring will inherit the longer beaks (heritability) resulting in a population with more long-beaked birds in the next generation.

No ""intention"" or ""understanding"" is therefore needed.",1580232658
t1_ffu0lh0,t3_ev89ja,"And then the birds who happen to get good random mutations have easier life and thus more likely to reproduce, increasing the likelihood of their kids to also have that feature, and the ones with short beaks are less likely to survive and reproduce, suppressing the passing of the bad trait to the next generation. Okay now it's all clear.",1580232457
t3_ev89ja,t3_ev89ja,"I think the idea of mutations leading to adaptation (while mostly correct) can be a little misleading.

Think instead about a population of birds. Each bird is slightly different from the others. One might have slightly longer wings than the rest, one might have longer legs, one might have a particularly long beak...If you measure traits like these in a population of organisms, you will find this kind of variability and that is what natural selection acts upon.

It's not really plausible that this one bird with the longer beak just happened to have a mutation that made his beak slightly longer than the rest. Rather, beak size is probably the result of an interaction of several genes. The particular combination this bird received came from his parents, which they got from their parents...so through reproduction, new combinations of these genes are always popping up. And in those genes is a whole history of mutations that occurred all along the lineage leading up to that bird.

So, natural selection acts on the existing variation in a trait. That variation comes from individual differences in genetics that come about from mutations and the mixing and matching of genes that occurs during reproduction.",1580232427

The Holocene extinction, otherwise referred to as the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction, is an  ongoing extinction event of species during the present Holocene epoch (with the more recent time sometimes called Anthropocene) as a result of human activity. The included extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. With widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, or no one has yet discovered their extinction. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than natural background rates.The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna, starting at the end of the last Ice Age.

t1_ffrq0iu,t3_etnwn5,"Not particularly, because my writing ability is pretty horrible, but my usage and applications is good enough for the teacher's standard I guess. I'll basically give a rundown of key aspects my paper examined however, and you can feel free to critique it as you would. The whole paper was brain size to intelligence, so it wasn't specific to humans and apes in particular, as I also examined instances where humans may have a larger or smaller part of the brain, being  gray matter in the prefrontal area, due to exposure of lead in childhood. I also mention the size of crustaceans having very large brains in proportion to their size, but largely not being intelligent creatures. In it I found that humans actually have a brain size much larger than it should be. Part of my paper examined the diversion of humans from apes, being that scientists estimate 150 million neurons were being added every one hundred thousand years, which if you decide to do how many were being added a year, which I'm not sure if there would be a difference, besides maybe intelligence being estimated to be genetic, and that each generation inherited an exponential difference of neurons. While humans brains were evolving, the volume of the brain tripled, having an approximate 1400 cubic centimeters, which is what we modern humans have today. Our white and gray brain matter also grew in size and we developed more complex cortical folding. Great apes have an average brain size sitting at around 350-450 cubic centimeters, while still displaying a similar brain organization pattern. This isn't word for word, and I'm largely paraphrasing because I can't copy and paste my paper here, because it is on my computer, not my phone, but this is the part where I examined the diversion of our intellectual diversions. And examining the cranial vault of Neanderthal skulls, scientists determined they had a 10% larger brain that humans do, but this was largely due to their incredibly large size, and needing a larger brain to function, so it quite possibly could have been smaller by a little bit, comparing pound for brain size. Humans also have a brain 3 times larger than it should be when you compare trends in the animals kingdom, so we have a larger brain in general. So I largely understand why our brains are different from our tree dwelling cousins,but what I don't understand is how so far humans are the only ones that gage developed an evolutionary stem of intelligence, seeing as how apes have existed far longer than us, and we've seen many traits evolve separately, being sight, as it is estimated to have come into existence in 5 separate times, being that 5 different organism would independently to grow sight.",1580165586

The Weberian apparatus, on the other hand, is made from modifications to the first four vertebrae. It's also unique to one group of ray finned fishes, the Ostariophysis.

To get a better picture the entire series from beginning to end provides a better picture on what you’re asking, if you actually want to know, but for a general overview- brains are useful at all in multicellular organisms that are mobile - so anything more advanced or like us than a worm. Then for a more advanced brain like those found in fish it comes down to predator-prey selective forces so that prey learn how to avoid being eaten while predators learn how to not starve to death.

t1_ffp392g,t3_eufi8l,"In wild species that have an established social order and evolutionary history that involves incest there are offnen no genetic issues other than lack of genetic diversity.

Inbreeding depression and the expression of deleterious genes tends to be mainly when a portion of a larger population forced into an inbreeding situation (as is the case with domestic animals).

In the wild small populations that have had been inbreeding for a long time (many generations) have often weeded out those bad genes.  There is still the issue of a lack of generic diversity though, which can be a problem if a disease enters the population or if environmental conditions change resulting in an inability of the species to evolve to meet the new environment due to said lack of diversity.

My current work is with a nearly extinct primate species that has been isolated on one small island for the last 12,000 years and during that entire time would have had a small population (although *much* larger than it is today).",1580128130

t1_ffpol0t,t3_eu2kgf,"The fact that OToL lists its sources is definitely a major plus and leaves OneZoom more suspect (Though from the fact that many of the date values OneZoom gives are suspiciously similar to those of TimeTree, I would guess that it uses a similar method of aggregation.). I also like how in many areas it provides both supporting and conflicting papers for the arrangement of taxa shown.

I understand your point that identifying which taxa diverged first in a particularly ancient lineage is very difficult, but I’m sure you would agree that (at least in some instances) it is very important to get right. Whether ctenophores or poriferans diverged first has tremendous implications on how the earliest animals evolved. A similar example of a current dispute in how the topmost clades within a taxon diverged can be found within Dinosauria, where the relationships between ornithischians, theropods, sauropodomorphs, etc. may have a huge impact on whether the earliest dinosaurs had integument and/or air sacs, and thus may consequently inform us about the evolution, lifestyle, and physical properties of their descendants. It is for this reason that I took the ctenophore-poriferan relationship in OToL so seriously, especially as it does not even consider the topic a matter of debate (AFAIK, no conflicting sources are cited).

I feel that the best method of dealing with conflicts for any biota-wide phylogenetic tree project would be to add alternative (and likely but yet-to-be-confirmed with further research) placements for taxa in dotted lines, with the shade of the text getting ever lighter with weaker support before ceasing to exist upon crossing a certain threshold (e.g. Eocyte/Asgard hypothesis = dark grey, Ornithoscelida = lighter grey, Heilmann’s bird-thecodont hypothesis = not on chart).

Then you are the one misreading, because I did not disagree with or ignore that point. I completely agree that it is not only a valid point but an important one. In fact it's not just that the state of conflict is not recent, the OP is objectively wrong in his claim. The world is more peaceful today (using a broad definition of ""today"") than it has ever been at any point in it's history. 

All I disagreed with was the framing the site the other poster linked to used, and that he repeated. It was misleading. Why should we exaggerate and say that ""the US has been at war for 222 of it's 239 years"" when that is really not true? They are using a highly misleading definition of ""at war"", and they consider even a single military engagement as being ""at war"" for an entire year. The real amount of time the US has been at war is bad enough, so why make it sound even worse than it really was?

Of course, *genetically* they might be perfectly compatible, so one could argue that the mechanism ""misfires"" in this case from an evolutionary standpoint. 

Alternately, biological siblings never develop a visceral revulsion for each other if they were raised separately and never knew each other as siblings. I'm sure most siblings in this situation today decide not to make babies if they know they are siblings, but the decision won't be based on a gut feeling. It will be due to cultural reasons (e.g., norms against incest) or simply due to knowledge that the babies won't be healthy.

&gt; I got lucky to find an english source for austria

I'm not sure what you think that link is showing, but it certainly isn't showing rampant corruption, murder or rape. And that site does not show historical rates, so it does nothing at all to support your argument. 

The only thing that *slightly* supports your claim is that there is a ""moderate"" *perception* that crime has been increasing for the last three years. But perceptions aren't necessarily the same as realities, and if the crime rate was skyrocketing as you are claiming it is, there would be far more than a ""moderate"" perception that that was the case. 

For reference, [in the US there is a ""high"" perception that crime has been increasing for the last three years](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/country_result.jsp?country=United+States), when in reality that [crime is at near record lows.](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) The *actual* crime rate per capita  in the US has not been as low as it is today since 1965. This shows that perceptions of crime have little or no relation to the actual crime rate.

&gt; Should I send you the links for Iran and poland too ? 

I mean, it's easy enough to select those countries from the pop down menu (https://www.numbeo.com/crime/country_result.jsp?country=Iran https://www.numbeo.com/crime/country_result.jsp?country=Poland), but again, that site tells you about *perceptions.* You are a perfect example why people's perceptions about crime rates are useless at determining the actual crime rate.

Actual historical crime rates are slower to be reported than perceptions (it's easy to poll people on their peceptions, it's hard to actually crunch the numbers from every city in a country) but here are *actual* crime stats for the three countries you mention:

t1_fecu3fg,t3_enwx9m,"Hey, sorry about taking so long to respond. I had some stuff come up in real life and took a break from reddit.

&gt; Ok. Let me ask you something: What about the development of wings in dinosaurs? How did all the necessary components of each wing, including muscles, nerves, cardiovascular structures, etc all manage to get put together into a coherent whole when there was never any direction to bring them together?

The same way it happened with bats and pterosaurs. In all these animals, wings are simply modified arms. No new structures or organs evolved; every single piece of their wings existed before, and exist in us too. For dinosaurs specifically, it seems that the early ancestors of birds were small dinosaurs which lived in forested areas. They already had feathers, though not ones suitable for flight, because many dinosaurs had feathers for the same reason mammals have hair and fur; for warmth. It is also likely that feathers were used in mating rituals and displays. Some of these small dinosaurs had enough feathers on their arms to either make jumping from tree to tree less dangerous, or made flapping their arms something which aided in running up a tree, or something of that nature. Once there was a fitness advantage to having additional surface area on their arms, natural selection would have started promoting new adaptive variants until eventually these animals could glide, and further on in evolutionary history, could fly. The wings did not pop into existence from nothing, and a new animal was not born suddenly needing their nervous system to behave in a way dramatically different than their parents. Each part slowly and iteratively co-evolved together from structures that already existed. This is how all evolution works.

&gt; Pardon me if I misunderstood you here, but if it's using existing variants, how do new components, traits, etc pop up? Sure, it isn't immediately producing an entirely new structure, my hangup more has been that with so many different things to develop, and no idea of what will work and what won't, it has to try a lot of different things, and in the process, it will make a ton of missteps, and so it seems it would need a crap ton of trials, and yet with most populations that have spawned new species, it has not had that luxury.

It's using existing variants because all new complex adaptations come from slight modifications to old ones. Mutations with very minor but measurable effects that don't have a meaningful impact on fitness are happening all the time. Do entirely novel mutations sometimes pop up that are very adaptive? Sure. Does this seem to be common (at least in multicellular organisms)? No. The minor variation without much of a fitness impact will accrue and mix and match in the population until either a combination of variants come together to produce a new complex phenotypic variant that *is* significantly advantageous, or the environment shifts in such a way that some of that existing variation is suddenly very advantageous while other parts of the existing variation is disadvantageous. This is what happened with the famous example of Darwin's finches. So to your point, missteps are made all the time, constantly, as are new and novel variants. Life has simply evolved in such a way that most variants have a relatively minor impact on phenotype and fitness, and so while selection is stable, evolution at the level of phenotypes is slow (assuming large population sizes). It's when selection shifts and suddenly previously ""neutral"" variants are now either advantageous or not that more rapid bursts of evolution seem to occur. In either case though, new variation is always being introduced by mutations and ""tested"" by natural selection.

&gt; I could be wrong, and I'm willing to admit that, but most animal populations historically have not had huge numbers to start with, if you take a divergent population, their numbers are going to be even less than the already small main population.

There are plenty of animal populations with numbers in the hundreds of thousands or millions. It's absolutely possible for very substantial sub-populations to split off. Smaller populations are definitely more prone to extinction, and when smaller ones do break off from a large population they probably do die off a lot. There's a bit of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) in considering only those populations of animals that we observe.

&gt;So, the incompatibility is more a result of genetic structure incompatibility than observable trait gene incompatibility?

Fundamentally, yes. When genetic pathways are still compatible, different species (or subspecies) can still breed and produce mixes of things between the two. Things like mules, ligers, tigons, and pizzlies are examples of this. When complete failure for the zygote to develop occurs, it isn't because the two parent species have entirely different structures, it's because the underlying pathways that program the development of those structures have diverged to the point where they aren't compatible and interfere with each other.

&gt; As for what I said, aren't beneficial and negative traits still a part of drift, because a trait popping in or out randomly still has an impact, positive or negative, on survival? Maybe you need to help me understand drift vs natural selection better?

Drift has a larger impact in small populations because a single copy of an allele being added or removed from the population due to random chance means that the frequency of that allele in the population has changed much more dramatically in a small population than a large one. Because natural selection cannot stop drift, but rather can only work with variants that exist in a population at any point in time, small populations make it ""harder"" for natural selection to promote good traits and remove bad ones. In larger populations, random events affect the distribution of alleles much less meaningfully, so variants stick around for longer which gives natural selection more time to act on them.",1580078006

t3_euczqp,t3_euczqp,"Climate change has made resources more unpredictable at the same time that cultural and economic changes have affected the types of resources people and populations compete for. The combined effect of this is to make most populations around the world more unstable, competition see-saws and ecology shifts. One super important part of this has been an increase in migration rates, particularly long-distance migration, which has been found in many species on the planet today as they respond to changes in their environment. Humans are no different. Migration is a major, but under-appreciated, mechanism of evolution. A shift in the rates and patterns of gene flow has widespread evolutionary consequences.

In part, the consequences of more gene flow are, as you say, evolution of the body rather than the mind, population gene pools become less isolated. Really, though, you can't really draw any kind of sharp distinction between body and mind. Cultural evolution, which responds to the exact same evolutionary drivers as biological evolution, is going through the parallel evolutionary shift in response to the exact same factors, though I guess we'd have to call it meme flow rather than gene flow. The thing with gene flow (and meme flow) is that its effects are difficult to predict. Migration introduces new trait diversity to populations, which can be beneficial in a changing and unpredictable environment. However, it can also disrupt the evolved patterns of gene-gene or meme-meme (and potentially even meme-gene) interactions called local adaptation.

Whether gene flow ultimately stabilizes a broader lineage or destablizes it and potentially moves it towards extinction depends on too many factors to really identify, but they include the strength and nature of prior local adaptation, rates and trajectories of environmental change, and the rates and patterns of the migration itself. The thing that makes cultural evolution in humans different is that we can be aware of it and maybe even consciously shape it as it's happening. Hopefully for the better of all.",1580077587

&gt; Last 10 years are full of wars, people going mad and rape, natural disasters, policians are stupid and people are worse.

This is objectively false. It is true that in the last *4* years we have seen some regressive trends in the political world, but for the 8 years before that  we had the first black President, and he was generally considered to have done an excellent job running the country. Globally, we had the Arab spring and a variety of other positive developments in the world. 

But we have *radically* fewer wars today than we have ever had in the history of the world. Crime is lower today, on average, than it has ever been before.

But sadly, positive change is often accompanied by a backlash, and that is exactly what we are seeing now. The world liberalized *fast* in the early 2000's. Look at the acceptance of gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana as just two points of reference. In 2000, few people supported either of these, today the majority of the population supports both. But for conservatives who oppose these things, these are critical things that they need to fight back against, so they responded by electing a reactionary populist President. If you are a liberal, it is hard not to view the last four years as a horrible slide back to a much worse era-- and I don't even disagree. But four years is just a bump on the road. 

&gt;  Is this part of a new evolution for our race ? I allways believed that evolution comes after chaos. Like black death or world wars. I mean evolution of mind, not body.

No. 4 years is *nothing* when it comes to human evolution.

&gt; Reading book, studying...nothing helps us.

It depends on what books you read. Try Steven Pinker's [The Better Angels of our Nature](https://smile.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010) or [Enlightenment Now](https://smile.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0143111388) to get a better picture of the actual state of our world.  The first analyzes the history of war, crime, and violence, and shows that, contrary to what people think, we live in the safest, most peaceful time in all of human history. The second takes that a step further and shows that we live in a better world today in just about every possible sense than we have in the past. Of course he's not arguing that things are perfect, but he's making the case that they are actually far, far better than people think, and I think he presents a lot of evidence to support his position. 

Enlightenment Now was written in response to the rise of Trump and the modern right, but I will concede that things have gotten a lot worse in the time since it was published.

You seem to be confusing a lot of issues and conflating them.

That can have an effect on the tests we use to measure intelligence, but those are due to short-term  *environmental* variables, not to an inherent lack of intelligence.

In the larger sense, evolution takes any trait (intelligence, speed, strength, etc) as far as it is useful for the continued reproduction of the species.

Human ancestors went through some of them, like having to change *how we give birth* to accommodate larger skull sizes. These types of barriers can be considered as making intelligence ""not favored,"" but that's sort of a semantic argument at this point. Overcoming a barrier unlocks all sorts of favorable benefits, so can we really say it's ""not favored"" to become more intelligent? Or should we be saying that sometimes ""becoming intelligent"" isn't *as favored* as evolving other structures for the niche?",1580015143
t3_eu24yr,t3_eu24yr,"You've somehow substituted different living conditions with ""intelligence."" That's already skewing your perspective on this. I can see the train of thought, that being more intelligent makes us want to build more ""technologically developed societies,"" which seem to have lower birthrates, but that's still not an agreeable conclusion to make simply because you haven't demonstrated that a lower birthrate means that intelligence is somehow ""disadvantageous"" or ""not selected by evolution."" We can point to many different species with lower birthrates, and some with astronomically higher birthrates. What you want to look for are signs that they inhabit a stable niche. Humans have the ability to dramatically alter the environment they live in, so in some cases I would argue that developed nations are ""more stable"" than developing nations, indicating that the populations therein are in a stable niche of sorts.

Let's also consider that just because *not every species has a trait* doesn't mean that the trait itself is *not favored*, selectively speaking. We already know the trait is successful *in humans* because humans have the ability to live potentially anywhere on the planet, save for conditions reserved for extremophiles. We also see that intelligence is a spectrum or range of possible states where other intelligent species exist, and appear to be in stable niches (dolphins).

Evolution operates by attempting *practically every possible avenue* and culling the ones that don't work, but you can't try every trait out at once, and some are just *more favored* than others for a given niche. We hit the jackpot because we got to use our intellect along with fine tool-making hands.

I think you're focused too much on the sociocultural element of what intelligence brings in collectives, without actually focusing on the biological aspect, which is more the domain of evolution. Sociocultural issues like lower birthrates, cost of education, and less time/emphasis for the nuclear family structure, aren't exactly good indicators of how ""favored"" intelligence is *by evolution*, so your question doesn't appear to have a conclusion supporting your hypothesis. Simply comparing birthrates between a developing nation and a developed nation isn't enough, and the added baggage of specialized work ethics and time management between labor and family rearing only touches tangentially on something that would concern evolutionary biology.",1580013768

A subtly different, complementary take on this: evolution seems to inherently favor *modularity* 

&gt; *A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks—their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits—but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.*

WRT to those sign experiments, he spends a fair amount time going in to why the studies were no where near as interesting as people were claiming, but here's a representative  quote from the only actual deaf person who worked on the team communicating with these gorillas by sign language:

&gt; Every time the chimp made a sign, we were supposed to write it down in the log…. They were always complaining because my log didn’t show enough signs. All the hearing people turned in logs with long lists of signs. They always saw more signs than I did…. I watched really carefully. The chimp’s hands were moving constantly. Maybe I missed something, but I don’t think so. I just wasn’t seeing any signs. The hearing people were logging every movement the chimp made as a sign. Every time the chimp put his finger in his mouth, they’d say “Oh, he’s making the sign for drink,” and they’d give him some milk…. When the chimp scratched itself, they’d record it as the sign for scratch…. When [the chimps] want something, they reach. Sometimes [the trainers would] say, “Oh, amazing, look at that, it’s exactly like the ASL sign for give!” It wasn’t.

I’m not saying I can guarantee there is no way to build a ship without “hands” but I feel like this is sufficient justification to expect hands (or something like an elephants trunk or octopuses tentacles).  I would be shocked if our alien visitors had the body form like a horse with hooves.

Likewise I would be shocked if what visited us was a single individual that was hostile to all members of its own species unless it was trying to mate.  I would be shocked they were multiple but couldn’t communicate and didn’t pass on knowledge.  I just can’t imagine another way that you can get to space.

Like at the very least, if you’re a species capable of inter stellar travel I’d expect you to have appendages that can be used to build stuff.  Otherwise... how did you build a spaceship.  I’d expect you to be social cause it’s hard to build a spaceship alone.  And I’d expect you to be able to communicate and transmit culture.

t1_fffskyl,t3_etcuy3,"Right. But the phenotype forms from the biochemistry to perform the biochemistry. And I'm saying that the inability to form cell membranes to bind organelles, and having genetic material that is a 2d sheet rather than a 1d chain, and being bound to a high-temp high-pressure environment for the sake of it's biochemistry, definitely isn't gonna evolve to meet needs in the same way as life with different biochemistry, because it has a wildly different environment to meet it's different biochemical needs. Photosynthesis won't come into existence underground (duh) and silicon based life won't live above ground. So, you now have an evolutionary chain where the autotrophs don't reach for the sky, crowding for sunlight. Which means the phenotype of what eats them will be different in order to effectively eat them. Which means the phenotype of predators will be different in order to effectively do predation. No membranes and a genetic material that isn't an unzipping chain means that mitosis wouldn't happen in the same way, like at all. And if mitosis doesn't happen the same way, then the path from unicellular to multicellular via colonies of cells dividing but staying connected until eventually developing differentiation isn't gonna be that path. Since a 2d sheet of information doesn't unzip into 2 halves with equal and opposite information encoded creating a template for 2 new DNA strands, meiosis can't occur the same way. Gamete formation and fertilization can't happen the way they do here. Sex may not develop at all. Convergent evolution makes sense with simialir biological needs in similar environments. Changing the biochemistry of the abiogenesis evident necessarily changes the biological needs and where that biochemistry is possible determines the environment life evolves to survive in.",1579892221

If something similar, the cell types/biochemistry, can emerge into many different ways of approaching the same result. Then, even if the biochemistry is different, it would have to evolve under natural selection and mutation. 

Imagine any different starting biochemisty, then why would it end up looking different in appearance? What other systems would it need just becauase it's chemisty is different? If it's life, thus it evolves, it would still need to develop systems for the physical world around it which would lead to the same things we see here (vision, hearing, touch, taste, etc.).",1579891230

If all you mean by ""resemble"" is: will there likely be a general 3-way division between 1) organisms that harvest energy from non-living sources (ie. light, volcanic activity, etc.), 2) organisms that survive by eating other living organisms, and 3) organisms that survive by eating dead organic matter. Then, I'd say, quite likely.

If by ""resemble"" you mean will there be things that look like trees, grass, insects, fish, birds, mammals, etc., I think that would depend on how similar the aquatic and land-based environments are to Earth. For example, if the atmosphere has very erratic and violent winds, perhaps nothing bird-like could evolve. On the other hand, if the atmosphere is calm and substantially denser, making flight easier, it could encourage bird-like creatures to evolve even more prolifically than they have here.",1579890981

This would severely limit silicon’s life-like chemistry.  Maybe you could have something silicon-based that’s sort of alive, but only in the sense that it passes on information. There have been ideas about minerals holding information the way DNA holds information.  DNA holds information in a chain that is read from one end to the other.  In contrast, a mineral could hold information in two dimensions [on its surface].  A crystal grows when new atoms arrive on the surface, building layer upon layer.  So, if a crystal sheet cleaved off and then started to grow that would be like the birth of a new organism and would carry information from generation to generation.  But is a replicating crystal alive?  To date, I don’t think that there is actually any evidence that minerals pass information like this. Maybe deep below the surface of a planet in some very hot hydrogen-rich, Oxygen-poor environment, you would have this complex silane chemistry.  There, maybe silanes would form reversible silicon bonds with selenium or tellurium.",1579890456

Maybe a question that we could try to answer is: If we could run evolution on Earth like a simulation a million times, what percentage of the time would the outcome be similar to what we currently have?

My guess would be - probably a lot. The way the genome works tends to favor specialization. So you'd expect multicellular life to arise, followed by systems biology, limb development and I'd expect centralization of something akin to a nervous system.

If this is some foreign planet though, and the life either doesn't use a genome or has one very different from ours, I think a lot of things are possible.

There are certainly exceptions, but usually, you really need to have a ""faculty advisor"" that has agreed to take you on as a student before you can get accepted into a PhD program. And you really want to make sure this advisor is someone you can get along with and most importantly, someone that does good research on the topics that you find interesting. 

All of that said, I think you will find it very difficult to pursue a PhD in evolutionary biology without a strong background (i.e. a bachelor's) in biology. Almost all graduate programs in biology include some course work, usually advanced biology topics like population genetics, statistical ecology, genomics, etc and most of these will assume proficiency in undergrad-level bio. 

It's also very common to be funded with a teaching assistantship, so many PhD students are expected to teach intro-level biology to undergraduates.

In my head I was just assuming that variation wasn't *that* unplanned. Given that qualification, it seems like (in my very limited knowledge) that my original points still apply.

For example, in your post you talk about how frontal fish fins were most likely a modification of pre-existing gill arches. Now obviously, ""fish biology"" didn't *plan* that modification.

So then it seems like we circle back to my original questions. Why don't we see visible modifications to bone structures that are equivalent to the modification ""attempts""/variations from which the ""gill arch to pectoral girdle"" transition arose?

If such progressive modifications of pre-existing technology are essentially unobservable to the naked eye, how do they resist be drowned out by ""louder"" factors (like immediate reproductive benefits) that would drive selection?

Fungi In an interesting case, as they reproduce asexually by budding off a new clone, by breaking up into fragments and regrowing, or by producing spores, which are a bit like seeds.  But some fungi reproduce sexually as well, every other generation.  That’d be like if you were born, lived your life, cloned yourself when you turned 90, lived a second life, then reproduced with a partner normally and made a child.

When fungi reproduce sexually, it works a bit differently than in mammals, but they do produce something like sperm - haploid cells which can fuse together to form a new fungi cell with merged nuclear DNA from two parents.

Some animals do produce what we’d call sperm, and have a muscle contraction process to eject that sperm out of the body.  Insects and fish are just simpler or older organisms which do this.

On the urination side, all cells excrete waste, so that started first.  Excreting urine specifically, however came later.  Urine is a liquid waste containing urea, which is produced from the ammonia made during metabolism in what’s known as ureotelism.  Mammals and amphibians do this, while other animals like birds rely on uric acid instead.  Insects and fish don’t produce much urea, and fish excrete their ammonia through their gills, so they don’t really urinate.

We would likely not see stubby, useless limbs show up in an individual,  then see them slowly develop into full limbs over generations, as is being suggested.  That would be fighting against selective pressure during development, aiming for a goal of extra limbs over time, despite the downside of these “proto-limbs” doing nothing useful in the meantime.

Instead the most likely method of getting more of something you already have would be through a mutation in the DNA controlling how many of those things you get.  So one mutation can result in a complete second set of eyes or wings or legs.  Whether the rest of the body plan can accommodate those extra wings or eyes is another question.

Hox genes in fruit flies can get you extra wings, or legs where antennae should be, while hox-like control genes manage segmentation of the body.

The more complex the original form, the less likely the duplication of tissue will work effectively though: it’s easier for a centipede to have an extra segment with more legs and guts, it would be harder for a human to support a second set of legs on a single pelvis without problems.

None of these limb structures spring unbidden from nothing, mutating from protoplasmic stem cells into a proto-leg or proto-wing.  They are evolved through tiny inherited modifications of earlier structures.  Sometimes a novel mutation like a serial doubling of a segment might occur - resulting in multiple limbs that can then be modified (serial homology duplicating entire segments is likely an important driver in the early evolution of arthropods and annelids, and even chordates), but having a functional limb just show up out of nowhere isn't really something that can easily happen.",1579792161

t3_esnz3t,t3_esnz3t,"To make sure I'm understanding what you're asking, I'll rephrase what I think your question is: if evolution randomly tries stuff out, and that's how we got things like limbs, then presumably we should continue to see little proto-limbs (say little bumps) appearing on some offspring at arbitrary places from time to time as evolution continues to try new stuff?

The simplest answer is that we do. If you want to google 'human mutations' and look at some pictures, I'm sure some of them are genuine.

But you can imagine that, for a creature with no legs, perhaps having a bit of a leg is useful. But for a creatures that already has 4 legs, say, there may not be any advantage in having a 5th leg. It would cost something to build and might just add weight.

So we have probably reached a place in humans where any mutations that arise causing little proto-limbs are weeded out, rather than spreading.

As a more technical point, mutations can only affect the existing 'recipe' encoded in the DNA. So while we can imagine pretty much any change to the human form (proto-limbs, extra fingers, extra eyes, wings etc), these changes are not all equally likely to arise as a result of mutation. As an analogy, if you can change a couple of letters in a recipe for making a cake, there's probably only a handful of changes to the cake you can actually make. You might get it 'LIME' flavoured instead of 'LEMON', but you're not going to suddenly get it 'CHOCOLATE' flavoured. Depending on what the human recipe says, the probability of getting 'proto-limbs' in different places on the body will be different, and in some places it may be vanishingly small.

t3_esnz3t,t3_esnz3t,"The origin of limbs, at least in the vertebrates, is still not a settled debate. Vertebrate limbs (true paired fins) first evolved in the jawless fishes. A few classical hypotheses have been around to try to explain how they came to be, these include 1) the pectoral fins evolved through the modification of gill structures and, 2) both the pectoral and pelvic fins evolved from an ancestral lateral fin fold structure. There seemed to be evidence both in support and in contradiction to either hypotheses. There is yet another ""newer"" hypothesis the details of which I don't exactly recall, so I'll leave it out. What is clear is that many of the genes that pattern the development of paired fins were already in existence and serving other functions in the vertebrate ancestors. So evolving a new fin likely required rearranging the genetic programming of what was already there in the jawless fishes. 

In the invertebrates, limb-like structures have evolved multiple times in different lineages. Interestingly, there are some limb developmental genes that are shared across some invertebrates and vertebrates, despite their limbs having evolved separately. This may suggest that these genes are responsible for some sort of ""outgrowth"" program in the common ancestor. If we just look at the arthropods, we do in fact see structures that we don't normally call limbs (i.e. antennae, pedipalps) to be under the control of the same genes used for making limbs. In a sense, the antenna, popping out of the head, could be thought of as a ""proto-limb attempt"" that got specialized into being a sensory structure instead of a locomotory one.

&gt;The main reason why I ask is because it seems to me that in order for selection to eventually ""fix"", so to speak, the arm to a given location, you would have to try every other possible location at some rudimentary (infinitesimal?) level.

That's not necessarily true, as there can be constraints put upon by the existing body plan of the organism. For instance, bilaterians have broadly bilateral symmetry, so new ""limbs"" would not be expected to grow on just one side of the body. There are likely other developmental constraints that govern where these outgrowths can be located, even before natural selection acts to eliminate these variants.",1579756980

I don't accept this part of the premise; MOST primates are omnivorous, and human ancestors were likely no exception.

Snapping turtles are carnivores, tortoises are herbivores, and red-eared sliders are omnivores. So what was the ancestral turtle?

Similarly, tetrapods have (usually) 4 limbs because we descended from 4-limbed ancestors.  Early fish also have varying numbers of fins, but it happened to be the 4-limbed sarcopterygians that gave rise to the tetrapods. 

So there was variation, but that was long ago and limb layouts have been constrained by history since, for the most part. Once an organism has a working body plan, major changes to that plan are unlikely to increase fitness.",1579753673
t3_esnae1,t3_esnae1,"Your premise needs some updates, which is making the answer hard to find.  Plants coming first isn’t correct, and herbivores needing to comes first is also not accurate.  First would have been single-celled chemotrophs, consuming non-living organic compounds.  Then after a long time some kind of simple photosynthetic cells would have come about possibly purple, a variant of which would later be absorbed by other cells to create the chloroplasts of today.  All this would have been slow, with cells for a long time relying on multiple sources of energy/food.

After we finally get to multi cellular life, we already have some cells eating other cells, and some cells living off sunlight.  Multicellular life eating other multicellular life(carnivore) does not need to have happened second.  Plants didn’t come first, so herbivores and carnivores were co-existing from the start; co-evolving next to each other.

Later, when we finally get to more modern body shapes we’re familiar with (think four limbed tetrapods), there are a number of examples of families shifting from meat to plant diets or vise versa.  Gorillas are vegetarian, but their ancestors were not.  Horses are vegetarian, but their ancient ancestors were not.  All mammals stem from a common ancestor which in part was likely an insectivore, or at least a omnivore of some kind.  

There is opportunistic predation even among herbivores.  Cows and deer will occasionally kill and eat small animals.  It’s not common, but it happens.  And if there was survival pressure favoring this behavior, you’d expect to see a shift in the population, as occurred with Italian Wall lizards after they were introduced to a different environment :  https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/04/lizard-evolution-island-darwin/",1579753568

Yes, which is why the correctly propose that natural selection mechanisms purify non-5mc sites from the population.  


"" Instead, we propose that natural selection maintains methylation to  higher levels than would be expected from a neutral loss-gain process.  Supporting this model, our analysis of *C. neoformans var*. *grubii*  epigenomes demonstrated higher fraction of methylated CGs (median =  0.59) in dual LTR-harboring centromeric retrotransposon (Tcn) sequences  than in non-transposon centromeric sequences (median = 0.24). ""  


""Based on the observed rates of methylation loss and gain, the null model (*s* =  0) would predict an equilibrium fraction of methylated CGs of 0.047.  This is much lower than the observed fraction for Tcn elements (0.59),  consistent with a role for purifying selection. This calculation assumes  that the relative rates of methylation loss and gain measured in the  laboratory generally reflect those of wild populations and that this  ratio is not dramatically different across different centromeric  intervals. We note that non-Tcn CG sequences of the centromeres have a  higher fraction of methylation than predicted by a neutral model, which  may reflect a role for CG methylation in centromere function as inferred  from the TBZ sensitivity of cells lacking 5mC. Together, our  experimental and observational evolutionary studies support with a model  in which 5mC is inherited with high fidelity and that 5mC loss and gain  events in *C. neoformans* act in a manner akin to mutation in  DNA sequence by producing random variation upon which natural selection  acts. As with the evolution of codon bias, selection is likely to be  weak with no requirement that any specific CG site be in the methylated  state.

Catania, S. *et al.* Evolutionary Persistence of DNA Methylation for Millions of Years after Ancient Loss of a De Novo Methyltransferase. *Cell* (2020). doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.12.012

The summary since people like clickbait instead of reading the actual study (emphasis mine):   
""Cytosine methylation of DNA is a widespread modification of DNA that plays numerous critical roles. In the yeast *Cryptococcus neoformans*,  CG methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the DNA  methyltransferase Dnmt5. We show that **Dnmt5** displays exquisite  **maintenance-type specificity** ***in vitro*** **and** ***in vivo*** and utilizes similar *in vivo*  cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably,  phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the **ancestral species  lost the gene for a** ***de novo*** **methylase, DnmtX,** between 50–150  mya. We **examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of  DnmtX**. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient  replication of methylation patterns in *C. neoformans*, rare  stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural  selection. We propose that an epigenome has been propagated for &gt;50  million years through a process analogous to Darwinian evolution of the  genome.""  


Quotes from the paper for the kids on here spewing bullshit about the results:   
"" To our surprise, Dnmt5 is a maintenance enzyme *in vitro* with extraordinarily high specificity for hemimethylated substrates. ""  


"" However, we observed that methylation loss after depleting cells of  Dnmt5 was not restored upon re-introduction of the enzyme. This was true  even if Dnmt5 was introduced through a genetic cross. ""  


""Thus, we conclude that 5mC has endured in *C. neoformans* for millions of years through the action of Dnmt5.""",1579722554

&gt; This is not a new mode of evolution as all mechanisms of evolution are premised on allele frequency changes in a population over time. NS doesn't care if that's DNA, RNA, mt's, or epigenetic adducts.

Natural selection is not the new mode of evolution described here. The fact that random methylations may contribute to the variation that natural selection acts on even over millions of years is what's new. This mechanism should apply even in organisms that do still have de novo methyltransferase enzymes as well, it just may be harder to detect it against the lareger signal of active methylation.

I'm not going to saying this study isn't interesting, because it is and I love it, but its also not what you're describing.
 
This fungus is still actively, repeatedly renewing it's methylation using a maintenance methyltransferase Everytime it divides, just like pretty much any other methylating organism does. It's just not modifying it's methylation pattern between cell cycles in the transient style you're referring to with additional methyltransferases. During each division of this fungus some methylation patterns may mistakenly change do to poor copying by it's maintenance methyltransferase, leading to selection opportunities. These same exact kinds of errors can and do occur in any organism that uses maintenance methyltransferase to copy methylation patterns during division, including human cells. It's literally not  new, it's just that in their system which has no secondary, transient methyltransferase activity, there's a more clear picture of how incorrect copying of the template strand methylation pattern can lead to selection opportunities. The major development here is that they have a system to study that so cleanly, not that it's a novel never-before-described ""mode"" of evolution IMHO.",1579722208

Negative frequency selection: this is when the most favorable trait in a population is the one that is the most rare (least frequent). For example, bees like visiting unique flowers. In a meadow where 90% of the flowers are yellow and 10% are purple, the purple ones will be visited more frequently due to the bees sampling different flower types. As a result, they have a high fitness level. Two years later, it may be that the meadow is now 90% purple, 10% yellow. The yellow flowers are now the most rare and will be selected for. 

Phenotypic plasticity: the ability for phenotypes to change based on environmental factors.

Children are so biologically costly that if females mated with males that were just ""meh"" about them, they would likely have to raise their children without much help from the father. So it makes sense to choose mates which are crazy about them. 

Love is the craze males evolved to convince females about how specially valuable they find them. After all, even if you were the most biased towards liking that female, but someone else was under the spell of a love delusion, then they would commit just about everything for her, and she would end up mating with him instead, as he seemed much more committing.

Some males then have deceitful love, with someone they think they're head over heels with, but once they slept about 20 times (just enough statistically to get her pregnant) he all the sudden falls out of love. He doesn't even know better. 

Some males have true love for her. Love is a signal of how valuable a male finds a partner, and if they actually find them very valuable, they're likely to fall in love. This also means that she is probably quite valuable, and for her this means she's got a lot of good options. This results in unrequited love. A female might enjoy the friendship and attention of a male that's in love with them. And if she were less high in mate value, or he were higher, they might make a wonderful couple. But this is love from the male, designed to elicit sex, but not getting anywhere. 

Mutual love occurs when both partners, due to their personal quirks and values, believe that their partners are a lot more valuable than they actually are in the mating market. This is very rare indeed, but it is what we are all looking for",1579633499

t3_erz0sc,t3_erz0sc,"No. It betrays a lack of understanding of how evolution works. 

There are a couple really important things to understand about fossils and their meaning:

First, it is staggeringly unlikely that any given organism will end up being fossilized. It takes very specific conditions for a fossil to occur, so the odds are literally tens of billions or probably trillions to one that a given lifeform will be fossilized when it dies. 

In fact we don't even have fossils for the majority of species that have ever lived. We tend to have lots of fossils for a few species that live in the environments where fossilization is likely, but for any that don't we have few fossils, if we have any at all. 

Second, when considering so called ""gaps in the fossil record"", you need to remember that no mother ever gave birth to a child that was a different species. Every child only varies slightly from it's parent. 

**Speciation is a gradual thing.** It doesn't happen in a single generation. No mother ever gave birth to a different species, but the great, great,........., great grandmother can definitely be a different species. Time is always a requirement in evolution. Again, this is an absolutely fundamental truth of evolution. If a mother did give birth to another species, it would actually disprove evolution, not confirm it. 

Stop and think about what that means... Imagine that we somehow have a true lineage of fossils, a complete record from a particular human all the way back to the first life form on earth. How would you be able to determine when one species became another? You couldn't, because it never happened.

**So it's only because of the incomplete fossil record that the idea of using fossils to identify species even makes sense.**",1579632673
t1_ff64rok,t3_ervaav,"Yes. A lot of behaviours that we see in species might not be of evolutionary advantage or disadvantage. It might just be a side effect or misfiring of actual evolutionary adaptation.

For misfiring example see the crow that takes care of cuckoo's offspring. For side-effect example see the curled tails of dogs. An experiment was done to select foxes with least flight distance. Eventual result was domesticated foxes but with dog like ears and tails though they were not selected for ears or tails.

t3_erw4ky,t3_erw4ky,"My suspicion: The birthing process is a very intense focus of evolutionary equilibrium. There's been a strong pressure for larger infant craniums: smarter babies are more likely to survive and reproduce. But this causes a danger to mother and child during childbirth, so we've adapted all sorts of work arounds: babies with compressible skulls, and early childbirths (human beings are born much more immature than even our closest ape cousins). Both of these have negative side effects.  


My guess is that the increased availability of C-section births will reduce this evolutionary pressure over time, which might result in even bigger skulls or later births. Probably will still take thousands of years to be noticeable though.",1579621008

t3_erfglb,t3_erfglb,"You appear to be coming at this with the view that things that help reproductive success feel good and things that harm reproductive success feel bad. That's a very decent and sensible starting assumption - having sex feels good, eating food feels good, getting your finger chopped off feels bad etc. Clearly there is a very strong correlation between good/bad feelings and help/harm to genetic interests.

However, humans are a much more nuanced animal than any other. Whereas all other animals mainly rely on hardcoded behaviours in order to be successful, we rely heavily on culturally learned behaviours. Whereas hardcoded behaviours come with a 'guarantee' that they are reproductively valuable (because what animal would still be around if its hardcoded behaviours were reproductively harmful on average?), humans' learned behaviours come with no such guarantee. It's perfectly possible for a group of humans to follow a course of behaviour that leads to all their deaths (eg the mass suicide at Jonestown https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown)

By and large, our more ancient behaviours and motivations (eg towards sex, food etc) do follow the good/bad feelings paradigm you imply, but we have the ability to cognitively override our ancient promptings - if we couldn't override our ancient promptings, we wouldn't be able to use any learned behaviours, because we'd be constantly pulled back by our ancient ones.

So what you have is an animal that has the ability to override and discount its own negative feelings. Yes I feel pain but I make the cognitive decision to pursue this course anyway, because I have cognitively calculated that it will benefit me in the long term. The pain comes from ancient wiring, the cognitive override comes from the more recent and uniquely developed contingent behaviour abilities.

One of the reasons we excel is precisely because we are able to behave in ways that are superior genetically to the behaviours suggested to us by our evolved psychology. The genes have said, we don't know what kind of a world you will be facing, so here's a cognitive module that can figure out environment-specific behaviours (including a lot of learning from others what useful behaviours they have found). Our feelings tell us the ancient answer, but we can disregard it when we have calculated/believe that we have a course that genetically beats the hard-coded one.",1579541006

A salamander may have superficial similarities and a degree of plesiomorphism (retention of primitive/ancestral features), but genetically and even outwardly, it is as far “evolved” from what most of us would call fish as any other tetrapod.

To be really pedantic, several living, non-sarcoptyrigian (non-tetrapod-line) fish have developed “limbs”. Frogfish and mudskippers are two very impressive examples but there are actually loads more. What’s really crazy is that some lungfish species can also use their fins to “walk” on the ground underwater, and they *are* lobe-finned fish, just like all tetrapods (meaning they are closer to us than to other “fish”).",1579415835

t1_feu4xdy,t3_elpx4b,"There is something called deterministic chaos, and I'm sure that your friend has heard of it (at least one example I know in pure math: the Lorentz attractor). It basically means that you can have deterministic laws, simple or complex, but depend heavily on the initial conditions of the system. Biological evolution, much like linguistic evolution, stellar evolution and other systems work in the same way: they're complex systems with complex laws and depend on initial conditions. This is why your model will always be oversimplified. The point is whether your model is closer to reality or not. The authors argue that their new model is better than the previous one. Is it incomplete? Definitely. Does the older model account for more observations? No, on the opposite. If you want to refute this model, do it in a way that proposes a new model that fits more observations, regardless of whether it supports speciation or not. If you find that a criminal investigation report is incomplete, propose a better one, because rejecting it doesn't mean that one goes back to the older report of 'Ghosts killed the man' (which asks more than it can answer). This is important, because it avoids us a great deal of going back anf forward.

On the other hand, as I said it is not my field of expertise, but I know that your article is only proposing a simple phenomenological law. Complex chaotic systems are difficult to study, and we generally use computational modelling to explore a more detailed picture involving lots and lots of data and many interactions. Instead of going into the details of K and L, it should bother you more if you're that pedantic that the equation doesn't take into account the effect of the whole ecosystem: natural selection isn't the only mechanism out there! I'm sure there are more thorough studies than this article, but you need a qualified expert up to date with the bibliography of the subject to give you a better explanation.

Now, to briefly answer your points:

1. Yes, K increases by 100 fold (I thought that was obvious). The more zeros you add to your 1 in a X chance, you add them to your K. That's because 1/log (x/(x-1)) is approximated by x for large numbers. I didn't say it wasn't a big deal, only that its value is beside the point. Notice also that your mean # of rounds depends on L as well, and that millions of years is not huge for evolutionary time scales (know also that you are working with the human genome). Also, given the size of a typical genome and the timescale of mutations, one in trillion seems unrealistic to me, but I can't justify it.

PS: I found this book [Ev. Biology.](https://books.google.lu/books?id=ZobfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=the+ratio+of+favorable+mutations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=64b2KyovfO&amp;sig=ACfU3U1TGtIn85u4ElTVltVpqgLn5-2iwg&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmsOOppI7nAhVMzqQKHb3tCawQ6AEwD3oECAYQAQ), which might be a good read, but I didn't go through it.

Anyway. For this point, the opinions of an expert with more insight regarding the rate of mutation and its fixation in many species are required for your satisfaction (not so sure about your friend though).

1(bis): 
&gt; ""The point that I'm making is that with larger population sizes, it takes longer and is probably more difficult to fix a favorable mutation.""

Well, yes. In that case you no longer work with a fixed population size, and K will be a complex function, and the theorem in the article's appendix would need to be corrected to add all the non-linearities of K and L being functions, and I'm sure it would be unsolvable.

&gt; ""How do we know that in order to account for the fixation of favorable mutations, we simply have to modify our favorable mutation rate ratio""

Because that's how the model is defined. If you ask that, then what you are looking for is another better but complicated model, which, you can feel free to work it out, but the final equation will be messier than those Lagrangians in the Standard Model of Physics.

""In reality, those correct guesses need to be combined into the DNA of real, discrete living organisms. It takes time to propagate the favorable mutations, and there is the chance a favorable mutation doesn't get selected. Again, these are not trivial issues.""

No they aren't trivial. I know it, you know it, and the authors know it. Because, again, the model is NOT reality. The chance of that model being invented in your lifetime is practically 0. So, you can try to find a way to add these complexities, I'm sure the authors thought about them, but adding non-linearities make problems unsolvable. If instead of taking Einstein's field equations and trying to precisely measure the gravitational effects of every stellar object, every particle, you would never solve that equations, ever.

2. Mutations happen at the nitrogen bases, but natural selection doesn't. Natural selection doesn't select mutations (if it did, life wouldn't exist). It is at the genes (or alleles) that are selected and passed, not base pairs. That's why the authors thought about genes as the quanta of their words: you can mutate a into à by a single mutation of a small line.

At the end, your friend who believes in the most unrealistic scenario, demands the most extraordinary proofs for the more realistic scenario. It should be the opposite.

t1_fdjq9kv,t3_elpx4b,"""I was trying to address the \*meaning\* they applied to K and L. But let's look at the claim that their conclusion really doesn't depend on the values of K and L.   


1. You challenged me to offer my most conservative estimate of a mutation being favored, even asking ""1 in a million, billion, trillion?"" -- as if the difference in the results would be trivial regardless of the estimate used. Well, let's take a look *using their formula,* and given the same birth and mutation rates used in the article. Let ""rate"" be short for the rate that a mutation is selectively favored, and let ""mean # of rounds"" be short for the mean/average number of rounds of guessing needed to guess the correct ""word"". The first example is the example used in the article.  


* If rate = 1 / 10,000, then K = (10,000 / 250 ) = 40. Then, mean # of rounds ≈ Log(20,000) / Log ( 40 / 39 ) ≈ 390  

* If rate = 1 / 1,000,000, then K = 4,000. Then, mean # of rounds ≈ Log(20,000) / Log ( 4,000 / 3,999 ) ≈ 39,610  

* If rate = 1 / 1,000,000,000, then K = 4,000,000. Then, mean # of rounds ≈ Log(20,000) / Log ( 4,000,000 / 3,999,999 ) ≈ 39,613,900  

* If rate = 1 / 1,000,000,000,000, then K = 4,000,000,000. Then, mean # of rounds ≈ Log(20,000) / Log ( 4,000,000,000 / 3,999,999,999 ) ≈ 39,613,946,900  


Remember that a ""round of guessing"", based on the values we've chosen to frame our examples, is 1 entire year containing 1 million births. So then, if we estimate a favorable mutation rate of one in 1 million instead of 10,000, then it will take nearly 40,000 years (on average) to arrive at our new favorable ""word"". If the rate is 1 in 1 billion, then it will take nearly 40 MILLION years to arrive at our new word. So \*yes\*, I still think it only begs the question to ""estimate"" a favorable mutation rate of 1 in 10,000, without providing a single source or calculation to back it up.  
(Aside: you said going from 10,000 to 1 million would only increase K by 100. It actually increases K by 100 \*fold\*. That may be what they meant though, so no biggie.)

  
2. I used the term ""assume"" simply to \*note\* the birthrate the authors chose as their example, not to \*connote\* some error. The point that I'm making is that with larger population sizes, it takes longer and is probably more difficult to fix a favorable mutation. How do we know that in order to account for the fixation of favorable mutations, we simply have to modify our favorable mutation rate ratio? If we're trying to arrive at a new ""word"" -- which is the entire genome and not a single gene -- then don't we have to arrive (at some point) at the entire ""correct"" word in one or more actual individuals? It's not enough that we guessed some correct letters in this round of guessing and some more in the next round of guessing and so on... In reality, those correct guesses need to be combined into the DNA of real, discrete living organisms. It takes time to propagate the favorable mutations, and there is the chance a favorable mutation doesn't get selected. Again, these are not trivial issues with large population sizes, as in our example producing 1 million births per year. Suggesting we can just tweak our favorable mutation rate to account for this merely begs the question.

  
3. Your explanation of how they calculated the K was helpful. I was stuck on the term ""letter"" and didn't realize they were just calculating a 1 in 40 chance of guessing the correct letter. Thanks. However, I still think it is an absurd oversimplification to think of the entire genome as our ""word"", and gene loci as the letters. Where it is much more common to discuss in terms of ""letters"" is in either the 4 nucleotide base pairs that compose DNA or the 20 amino acids that each triplet of base pairs codes for. Mutations don't just magically happen to genes -- they are changes to its sequence of base pairs. Reddit even said that a single gene is commonly thousands of base pairs long. So there may be 4-to-the-1,000-power of \*possible\* permutations of a particular gene locus. Not addressing mutations at this level -- and, instead, treating the set of gene loci as our ""word"" -- is, I think, avoiding or obscuring the issue at hand.""",1579383133

When you refer to “[our immune system] evolv[ing] a new resistance” or a virus “evolving to adapt”,  that’s not occurring in response to something. Rather, there is variation in the population due to genetic mutations which lead to some hosts being more susceptible or more resistant to pathogens, some of which are more virulent or less virulent. The hosts that end up surviving pass on those traits while the pathogens that are good at infecting hosts go on and spread.

It’s not as if one virus, in response to a resistant immune system, then changes its genetic structure to become more infectious.

t3_eq8jj2,t3_eq8jj2,"Mutations occur for one of three reasons.

1) Chemical. Free-radicals are basically electron thieves and cause oxidation. They're a normal byproduct of respiration and some other processes, and while DNA is normally shielded from free-radicals by the nuclear membrane, during mitosis or meiosis it is exposed to and can possibly suffer damage from free-radicals. DNA has repair mechanisms that usually fix any damage, but it's not always sufficient.

2) Error. Sometimes during meiosis or mitosis chromosomes don't replicate properly. The reasons are numerous, and can be from other mutation factors or physical processes, but it can result in fused or split chromosomes, duplicated chromosomes, missing chromosomes, or stunted chromosomes. 

3) Ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation actually causes damage via two mechanisms: first, through chemical means. Alpha and beta particles and gamma rays ionize the mediums they travel through. When they travel through humans, they ionize the water around them, creating free-radicals. But these particles and rays can also impact and ionize DNA directly, though it's much more unlikely for it to happen. 


So what normally happens with a mutation is that function of affected gene is shut down. Albinos, for instance, suffer from a mutation that stops their bodies from producing melanin. Same thing with blue eyes, but more specific. 

But every so often, a mutation will alter a gene's function rather than stopping it. Non-black people are an example of this, as their gene expression for melanin has been reduced, but not entirely shut down. Inuit peoples have changes in their genome that make their builds stockier (to better retain heat) and their nasal passages longer (to better heat air before it reaches the lungs). 

Even more rarely, a gene or entire chromosome will be duplicated and it won't result in the individual's death or severe handicap. In these cases, natural selection will act on the additional expressed genes and gradually change them over time, often in ways that make them completely unlike the gene/chromosome it was duplicated from.

For instance, mutations are caused by specific physical events induced by x-rays, cosmic rays, radioactive substances, some chemicals, and even 'mutator' genes. Not all genes are equally likely to mutate. Some parts of a chromosome are so-called 'hot spots' because of their higher mutation rate. Mutation rates in one direction may be different from rates in the opposite direction at any given site. Mutation effects are non random in the sense that changes have to be consistent with the organism's development processes.

Mutation is random with respect to adaptive advantage and it is natural selection that explains evolution and 'survival of the fittest'.",1579312538

Evolutionarily, stronger immune systems are [usually](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/science/02obsheep.html) favored thus increasing the specie’s overall chance of fighting off a disease. If an organism’s otherwise “strong” immune system isn’t functioning optimally due to deficiencies, fighting off something else, environmental factors, etc. the organism may be unable to elude death, possibly before it’s able to reproduce. Organisms with weaker immune systems may never get exposes to said pathogen and pass on their weaker genes. 


Add that to the addition modern medicine, where people with weak immune systems are able to live long enough to reproduce. Which puts up the question of the physiology of acquired immunity and the exposure to manageable pathogens at the right time in development leads to a strengthened immune system.

It’s evolutionarily beneficial to overestimate threat, rather than underestimate. And evolution wouldn’t have selected for our ability to distinguish scientifically between different species of venomous/non-venomous arthropods/arachnids, but rather for our ability to detect a gestalt phenotype: multiple jointed legs, exoskeletons, mandibles, etc. 

(2) similarly, there was evolutionary pressure to avoid areas and food sources that were likely to be contaminated—not by interspecies communicable disease per se—but rather by rot (ie bacteria, fungi, etc., that flourish in areas of decomposition and can make one quite ill if ingested). Arthropods (and worms and land molluscs)—venomous or otherwise—tend to flourish in such environments. Once again, evolution would have selected for general revulsion from such contexts—not so much for our ability to discern one specific species of non-venomous arthropod from another, more venomous one (although culture seems quite useful for this).",1579285081

I think it's likely that we are often (read: as modern humans in the 21st century) afraid of them because they don't match the body plan we come to expect from other animals. Most of our experience with other animals is with other tetrapods, which basically look like us (4 limbs, 2 eyes, 2 ears, a nose, a mouth), or with animals we don't intuitively know are similar to us (fishes, shellfish, barnacles, etc.). Arthropods—specifically those that aren't just buzzing specks in the air to be swatted—are creepy, because they have too many legs, too many eyes, and move entirely too fast for their size. And have you seen a dead spider? The way their legs curl up is creepy and unnatural seeming as fuck.

In short, we are socialized to accept a certain body configuration. Insects and especially spiders (as well as snakes and worms) have all or most of the parts we expect another animal to have, but lie in the space between a comically unfamiliar animal like a sponge or a sea cucumber and a fully realized tetrapod, which creeps us out in the same way a hyper-realistic doll with dead eyes does.",1579234646

t3_epp6yh,t3_epp6yh,"Another way of flipping the question is ""why are humans attracted to animals like tigers and bears"". I think the answer is that humans and most mammals have similar traits, while insects have very different traits.

You'll notice that there are some pictures of insects that look kind of cute, and certain features like the eyes tend to made grand. Google image ""cute spider"" and you'll see what I mean.

You'll note that artists will create pictures that take the essence of cuteness and apply it rightfully to anything. They can make robots, dogs, rocks, instruments, anything look cute by applying certain abstractions.

A way to think about it is that we have a somewhat preprogrammed idea of what is cute or beautiful, but they are more general criteria than a very strict measurement. A way to put it is that it is very hard for evolution to limit a higher-level sense of perception, say of the perception of beauty, to being only relegated to humans because it requires not just information about beauty, but also information about humans. Moreso, it is likely more efficient to develop to different systems that synergize, a system that can evaluate beauty, and another system that can evaluate humans, and then you get a system that can evaluate a human sort of beauty, as well as a sort of beauty that applies to other species and pretty much anything else.

It is important to note that insects and animals live in completely different realms of existence insofar as their sense experience and with their sexual selection. A lot of insect mating occurs through force and less through courtship, while a lot more of mammal mating involves female choice. Most insects don't have great vision either so there isn't much need for great displays of beauty because they can't be seen. It is like how the naked mole rat does not need to have any bright displays of color or very shiny fur because no other mole rat will see it.

Before anyone responds to my comments with pictures of beautiful insects, yes I agree that is beautiful, but you missed the point of my argument. There are plenty of insect species that do have a lot of mate selection and/or have a high degree of sense ability, and these species tend to have more classical features of beauty. And again, we can also apply an abstract sense of beauty to anything as I argued.

My post here attempts to argue why essentially mammals tend to be more relatable than insects, and it is pretty obvious but at the same time complex.

I am skeptical of the claim that beauty can't be quantified or talked about in regard to science. It's an emotion that can be measured and we tend to have a decent amount of agreement about what humans find beautiful.",1579222792

and:

&gt; One intriguing genome stood out: it was clearly a member of the archaea, but dotted through its DNA were genes similar to those seen in eukaryotic cells.

and:

&gt; But the theory’s proponents suggest that one of these cells could have engulfed a bacterium, with the bacteria then going on to become structures known as mitochondria, which act as an internal power supply in all complex cells today. Bacteria and archaea lack this internal architecture.
&gt; 
&gt; The Japanese team suggest that Asgard’s newly revealed spaghetti-like tendrils could have engulfed a passing bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with it. After several evolutionary leaps, the two organisms could have become one, more complex, cell type – a primitive eukaryote.

So, basically: archaeon with already some typical ""eukaryote-like genes"" engulfed a bacterium which gave rise to the eukaryotes.

Well, that's an old one: it's called the endosymbiotis theory about the origin of eukaryotes and was coined by Lynn Margulis in ... *1966*. The descent of mitochondria from bacteria and of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria was experimentally demonstrated in 1978 by Robert Schwartz and Margaret Dayhoff. This formed the first experimental evidence for the theory.

Again the very next sensational article written by an ignorant journalist thinking a ""breakthrough"" occurred, providing revolutionary new insights.

Similarly, a site like ""sciencemeetsreligion.org"" is going to be limited to approaching the principle from a religious lens.

But once those are stripped away the anthropic principle is still useful in applying proper Bayesian thinking about cosmology: we must, by definition, find ourselves in a part of the universe that can support life. Therefore we must take into account survivorship bias. At the same time we must assume that we are in the least extraordinary environment necessary to support life. 

To take an example of the linked PBS Spacetime video: given that a *galaxy* capable of supporting life is vastly more likely to randomly occur than an entire universe, while our observations suggest the latter is true regarding initial entropy at the big bang, that must mean that physics is as of yet ""incomplete"" in this regard.

t1_fefzjvj,t3_eon2zp,"**Anthropic principle**

The anthropic principle is a philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it, and that there is hence a survivorship bias. Proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.

The strong anthropic principle (SAP), as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it.

t1_fecvg8c,t3_enwx9m,"&gt; I've just had a hard time with the idea that it wasn't directed by an outside influence, 

Few people would argue that Evolution rules out such a possibility. A few would, but most of us will concede that such an external influence is not fundamentally incompatible with evolution. How could we ever prove that what we believe are ""random mutations"" don't have some guiding hand behind them?

&gt; such as a simulation programmer (can't rule out the possibility that we exist in some form outside this universe, and this universe is a simulation supplied to us like in The Matrix movies)

This is a common argument, but it's a really weird one to me. Not because such a thing isn't possible-- it clearly is-- but because it doesn't actually answer any questions. 

If we are living in a simulation, where did the beings who wrote the simulation come from? All you have done is push the explanation further away.

&gt;  a god-type being (not the Christian god, as I reject Christianity), etc. 

While I am an atheist, I do not ""rule out"" a god. 

But the flaw with all three of these questions is simple: **Where's the evidence?**

The time to believe that a given claim is true is when there is evidence supporting that claim. In all three of these claims, you are just making unfalsifiable statements, none of which are actually supported by evidence. 

I can't prove we don't live in a simulation, but I also don't see evidence that we are.  I see overwhelming evidence that the universe at least *appears to me* as a physical, natural world, so I follow the evidence until I have evidence that justifies believing otherwise. 

I can't prove that there isn't a ""god type being"" but, again, I just don't see any evidence that there is one. Contrary to the old aphorism, an absence of evidence *can be* evidence of absence *if we have reason to believe that such evidence should exist.* Depending on the specific god that is being argued for, there are a variety of possible bits of evidence that we can reasonably conclude should be visible, yet none of that evidence actually exists. Of course this doesn't prove a god *doesn't* exist, but it is one of many sound reasons not to believe that one does.

**On the other hand I *do* see evidence that the universe *could be* fully natural, and that life *seems to have have* arisen naturally and evolved naturally.** 

So when faced with various unfalsifiable explanations that are not actually supported by evidence, and one hypothesis that, while certainly not conclusively proven, seems to be well supported by evidence, the rational course is to provisionally accept the one that has evidence. That doesn't mean you have ""ruled out"" other explanations, though. A rational person never stops examining the evidence. 

&gt; And really, it was foolish of me to bring this up HERE, because that's ultimately a philosophy issue, not a science issue. It's entirely possible it was directed by outsides influence, and science has no way to prove or disprove that. Science isn't dealing with that.

While this is true, the fact that something is possible doesn't mean believing in that thing. Just because science can't disprove these possibilities doesn't mean there is evidence supporting them.

&gt; I have to disagree to some extent. If someone makes a claim, and I reject their claim on the basis of incredulity and I haven't seen a convincing argument and/or evidence in support of their claim (not that there isn't, it would be a matter of me not being made aware of it and not grasping it), am I denying their truth claim? If I am, aren't I justified in doing so?

That is actually what I said. You are justified in *questioning* the claim, not in denying it. It is fine to say ""This explanation sounds sketchy to me"", it is not ok to say ""This sounds sketchy, so it must be false.""

I would label your argument here as ""weakly fallacious"". Your reasons for doubting aren't really sound, but the incredulity is natural nonetheless. The reason I raised the fact that it is a fallacy wasn't that you are wrong for being dubious, but only to make you aware of the inherent unsoundness of the position. ""I can't believe that is true!"" is never a good reason to believe something is false. You need actual evidence. 

Remember, if you only look at the readily available evidence, ""I can't believe the earth isn't flat"" is a perfectly sensible statement. Yet anyone who makes that statement today is correctly regarded as a fool. What *seems* possible has little to do with what *is* possible.

&gt;  The burden of proof is on them.

That isn't necessarily true. The burden of proof is on whoever is making the claim. As long as you stick to asking questions, you obviously have no burden of proof (though be wary of what is known as the [""Just Asking Questions Fallacy""](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions)). But if you go one step farther than you have so far, and actually  argue that we should accept the possibility that we are in a simulation, or that there are gods influencing evolution, then you are know making a claim. *You* would then have the burden of proof. 

Edit: I think you may be misunderstanding the scope of my point here. Saying it is a fallacy to question the claim doesn't mean that you should just accept *any* claim unless you have evidence to the contrary. You *only* accept claims that are supported by sound evidence, and that do not have strong evidence to the contrary. 

You are correct that there is a burden of proof that rests on people saying that belief in evolution is justifiable, but given the evidence for evolution, that is not a  hard burden to meet.

I hope that clarifies my position.

&gt; As far as explosion and the 20 million years, yeah, it's just relatively speaking.

It certainly was a period of very rapid development relative to what happened before and after, but we understand how and why that happened. Creationists ignore that, because it is inconvenient to their arguments.

&gt; But if you say the craziness of that time was a result of the rapidly changing environmental conditions rather than evolution at that point being like humans were early on with flying machines with tons of different designs before we settled into using the common setups you see today, then ok.

I strongly suggest you read the book Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne. It explains all this stuff a whole lot better than I can.",1578991634
t3_eoe0fw,t3_eoe0fw,"Disregarding the immediate present day for a moment, perhaps charm, guile, and ruthlessness were needed for survival amongst prehistoric societies and bands if hominids.  That may then lead to having a group following a ruthless charismatic leader, which may then better the chances of the small group's survival. In prehistoric times killing people to claim their food and shelter, for example, like any other animal would kill or steal food. A more modern example could be found in ancient Iceland. A study I read, proposed in the translation of epic songs and Icelandic poems suggested that most wealth, property, and class were gained through straight up murder, and that's a small society that was very isolated (no wars of conquer). This can be seen in present day obviously, wherever you look.  Many ancient and modern world leaders were and are narcissistic sociopaths.  Many CEO's of major companies are narcissistic, etc.   Perhaps that trait has simply grown exponentially with the population boom in modern times.  I'm sure someone with more knowledge than I have could articulate it better.  I would imagine gods and religions were in part created to combat this seemingly innate human trait.",1578989699
t1_fe61ul4,t3_enwx9m,"&gt;People grossly underestimate just how long life has existed on this planet. This video gives you a better idea of just how many chances and how much opportunity life has had to evolve. The short answer is we have had plenty of time to evolve.

&gt;Another thing to consider that is easily missed: The earth isn't special.

&gt;I mean, obviously it's special to us, because we evolved here, but if we had evolved on some other planet, it would be that planet that is special to us, not the earth. So when you consider the number of opportunities, you have to consider the whole universe.

&gt;So how many possible planets could we have evolved on? The latest evidence says a lot. Estimates say there are between 200 billion and 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy has around 100 billion stars. That means conservatively there are about 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000-- 20 sextillion-- stars in the universe and possibly an order of magnitude more. That means that if even 1 in a billion stars has a hypothetically habitable planet that would mean there would be 20 trillion potential planets we could have evolved on. And the latest research into extra-solar planets suggests that number is probably a lot closer to 1 in a hundred than one in a billion.

&gt;Put simply, life has had plenty of opportunities to evolve.

My hangup isn't so much that life itself evolved, as getting from non-life to life honestly seems like a smaller jump than from the earliest life to the biodiversity we have today, even though we have far more evidence for and understanding of the latter than the former.

And remember also, I do think the evidence shows evolution has occurred. I've just had a hard time with the idea that it wasn't directed by an outside influence, such as a simulation programmer (can't rule out the possibility that we exist in some form outside this universe, and this universe is a simulation supplied to us like in The Matrix movies), a god-type being (not the Christian god, as I reject Christianity), etc. And really, it was foolish of me to bring this up HERE, because that's ultimately a philosophy issue, not a science issue. It's entirely possible it was directed by outsides influence, and science has no way to prove or disprove that. Science isn't dealing with that.

&gt;Your argument is what is known as an argument from personal incredulity fallacy. ""I just can't believe it's true, so it must be false!"" Now I realize you aren't actually saying it is false, you are just questioning it. And that's great, it is exactly what you should be doing. But you still need to be aware that you are using fallacious reasoning, and realize the limits of it's utility: Incredulity is a good reason to question, it is not a good reason to deny.

I have to disagree to some extent. If someone makes a claim, and I reject their claim on the basis of incredulity and I haven't seen a convincing argument and/or evidence in support of their claim (not that there isn't, it would be a matter of me not being made aware of it and not grasping it), am I denying their truth claim? If I am, aren't I justified in doing so? The burden of proof is on them.

&gt;The Cambrian explosion is often cited by creationists as evidence against evolution. It's not at all, they just misunderstand it.

&gt;First off, it's not an explosion. It took something like 20 million years. That is a lonnnnnggg time.Again, watch the video I linked above.

&gt;Second, it's not as much of an explosion as it first seems. life was already fairly well diversified before the CE, it is just that the life before the CE did not have bodies that had skeletons, so they had no body parts that could become fossilized under the typical conditions (which are already increidbly unlikely-- see my comment here from yesterday). We have an explosion of new species in the fossil record, because the fossil record itself was new (for the most part).

Thanks for better explaining that! As far as explosion and the 20 million years, yeah, it's just relatively speaking.

&gt;But as for your question, most of those weird ""experiments"" are due to the rapidly changing conditions at the time. Rapid change in the environment leads to rapid evolution. But rapid evolution doesn't mean the evolutionary ""experiments"" will be viable in the long term. Evolution ""tried"" various models, but those things were less efficient in the long term compared with others, so those species became extinct.

More what my thinking was, was that even once it developed successful body plans, systems, etc, it would still have to continue furiously tinkering in order to bring about the biodiversity we have today, and yet that is not what we see. Eventually, the tinkering slowed waaaaaaaaaay down.

But if you say the craziness of that time was a result of the rapidly changing environmental conditions rather than evolution at that point being like humans were early on with flying machines with tons of different designs before we settled into using the common setups you see today, then ok.",1578986205
t1_feaxwu9,t3_eo1bed,"The likelihood is because in America (and Canada), the vast majority of Asian people are Sino-Tibetan, and not so much Indian (although that is changing!). Near Toronto (where I live), some Indian people refer to themselves as brown people, not really using the word asian.

As other people have pointed out, race is merely a construct, it varies from place to place. Of course people shouldn't go around telling you what to call yourself.

At the same time, the only reasons we continue to divide ourselves is because of racism, language barriers and cultures. Take for example the common Domestic cat (the most common breed iirc) - we don't tend to ideologically separate these cats by their fur colours, geographical location, size, their owners culture or any other factor. They're all basically Domestic cats!",1578984885
t1_fe6di6x,t3_enwx9m,"&gt;Evolution is much more incremental than it sounds like you believe it to be. Some of those types of mutations do occur, especially for things like being born with one or no eyes, or three, body parts growing in the wrong places, etc. They're rare, but if you think they don't happen I suspect you haven't really looked. As for scales, that's not going to happen because as far as I'm aware, we don't possess genes that are necessary for that dramatic a difference in skin development to occur. We're not talking a single mutation being necessary, but probably hundreds in very specific areas of our genomes. If strong selection for tougher skin were applied for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it could probably happen. But it will never happen suddenly in a single generation.

Ok, gotcha

&gt;Additionally, developmental pathways in modern animals generally consist of sets of related developmental genes which occur in varying numbers. When a group of them get duplicated, you get an additional body part relatively close to where the original one was. So if you do look for cases where spurious organs are formed, you'll typically find that the extra one is pretty close to where the ""normal"" one would be. Again, it'd take a ton of mutations to get an extra anus on the foot or testes next to an ear compared to getting an extra ear on the side of the head or a spurious anus (probably without a hole) near the functional one. Fun fact, a lot of people have extra, half-formed nipples on their chests. Most of the time they look like a little blemish or a mole or a small patch of hair, and it'd take an expert to really say whether it is just a ""normal"" skin abnormality or an under-developed nipple.

Ok. Let me ask you something: What about the development of wings in dinosaurs? How did all the necessary components of each wing, including muscles, nerves, cardiovascular structures, etc all manage to get put together into a coherent whole when there was never any direction to bring them together? Just somehow, over time, the DNA of some specific individual dinosaurs coded the components to work together and be structured coherently as a wing? That is a LOT of different things that have to be developed independently, and then, they all have to be brought together to work as a coherent system. How did the brains of these dinosaurs acquire the ability to interface with the wing's nerves once it was developed into a cohesive whole? How did the brains acquire the ""programming"" to tell the wings what to do?

&gt;Are there enough people that pretty much every possible mutation is going to occur multiple times across the population every generation? Yes. Are most of these mutations pretty much non-functional? Also yes. Most of the types of changes you want to see would require at least tens of mutations across some very specific genes. While our population can produce each of those mutations individually, it takes time for them to accrue and mix and match in the population to the point where meaningful physical changes are noticeable.

The last sentence helps me to understand this much better.

&gt;Put more simply, evolution really happens and is driven by existing variants mixing and matching in the population over hundreds or thousands of generations. It does not really happen due to completely new mutations immediately producing an entirely new phenotype or structure.

Pardon me if I misunderstood you here, but if it's using existing variants, how do new components, traits, etc pop up? Sure, it isn't immediately producing an entirely new structure, my hangup more has been that with so many different things to develop, and no idea of what will work and what won't, it has to try a lot of different things, and in the process, it will make a ton of missteps, and so it seems it would need a crap ton of trials, and yet with most populations that have spawned new species, it has not had that luxury.

&gt;I would agree, though I'm curious what you think ""significant"" means specifically.

Maybe significant isn't the best word to use? Maybe a better way of putting it is sufficient difference in traits from the original population to render the two populations unable to get together and produce fertile offspring.

&gt;What is the basis for that assumption?

I could be wrong, and I'm willing to admit that, but most animal populations historically have not had huge numbers to start with, if you take a divergent population, their numbers are going to be even less than the already small main population.

&gt;What? No. That's ridiculous. Speciation almost certainly doesn't occur due to adaptions to their new environment. That would only happen if the two populations are still overlapping to some degree and there is selection against hybrids. Speciation (edit: between two truly isolated populations) happens because a sequence of mutations that are neutral within populations occur that aren't ""tested"" against an independent sequence of neutral mutations in the other population, and over time those otherwise ""neutral"" mutations accrue independently to the point where they are no longer compatible between the populations. Most speciation has little to do with the high level physical changes you observe accruing.

So, the incompatibility is more a result of genetic structure incompatibility than observable trait gene incompatibility?

&gt;First off, common sense isn't real. Don't rely on it as an argument. Second, you're flat out wrong here. It's well known and well established that random events (i.e. drift) has a much stronger impact in small populations than large ones. While natural selection (i.e. how good/bad a trait or mutation is) is much more effective and efficient in large populations.

I don't know if I'd completely toss common sense out the window, as it is better to go off of what is common sense at any given point until presented with a better argument or information, which you appear to have done here.

As for what I said, aren't beneficial and negative traits still a part of drift, because a trait popping in or out randomly still has an impact, positive or negative, on survival? Maybe you need to help me understand drift vs natural selection better?

t1_fdtsdex,t3_en2hoa,"&gt; But you are correct that isolation is an important part of speciation. Groups separated long enough will eventually diverge. That separation can be due to a population living in an island. BUT, they would likely need to not have things like canoes to ensure that they were truly isolated. They, and the nearby Nicobarese and Onge GOT to those islands by boat. Other humans managed to sail from Southeast Asia to New Zealand, Easter Island, Hawaii, some from northern Japan appear to have even made it to North America some 20,000 years ago; to think that the Sentinelese got to their island and then never encountered another human group for 60,000 years seems very unlikely. A DNA sample would likely be able to verify that.

Not so sure about your boat theory. I think the OP got it right. The Sentinelese are related to the Aborigenes and are descended from the group that migrated 60K ya when the ocean levels were lower. The Arabian peninsula was connected to the horn of africa and iran and they walked across that and walked all the way to Australia except for a 70 mile stretch between bali and lompoc, the Wallace Line. 

I understand your comment about oceangoing Asians such as the malays who were the first to reach distant Madagascar but you seem unaware of the Sentinelese reputation for summarily killing any outsider they meet, a reputation which bordering cultures say goes back forever. There is a good chance that any admixture from asian seafarers was minimal to zero.

The best way to answer the question is that the Aborigenes are from the same migration and also highly isolated until 200 years ago and they effortlessly interbreed and do not have any apparent unique features which evolved after arriving.",1578978603

t3_enu9p0,t3_enu9p0,"Darwin stated that variance occurs in any population. We now know this happens due to genetic mutations. When the living conditions change, mutations are favoured that match those new environmental demands. This is called adaptation to new environmental conditions. Such a subpopulation gradually starts to diverge from the other subpopulations still existing in areas where the living conditions didn't change. 

Individuals that are born that don't match those new living conditions have less chance to survive and/or reproduce successfully. They ""fit"" those conditions less, hence, 'survival of the fittest'.

After a while of divergence going on, this subpopulation may split off, a new species is born.

This means that each population has some variance. Because genetic mutations always happen, in each newborn individual. 

When those mutations don't mismatch the living conditions, they will not lead to less fitness and thus will stay. So any living environment allows a lot of variance without leading to speciation.

That allows differences in personalities as well.

But different traits *within* the same species also has multiple upsides for the total species to survive - different talents and skills greatly contribute to the wellness and survival chances of the group.

t3_eo1bed,t3_eo1bed,"Correct wording: all human are the same *species* and according to modern genetics there are no sub-species among humans (normally referred to as ""races"" - but as a term not in use anymore in genetics apart from botanics). and here's why:

1. the total genetic variance among humans is extremely small, though not entirely unique for humans, it's also found in other extant animal species. Genetics explains this as a genetic bottleneck and by intrapolative estimates date it back some 70,000 years and a total human population of some few thousands of breeding pairs (or even less) max. A genetic bottleneck occurs when the total population reduces considerably due to any cause (climate, disease, natural disasters like massive volcanic eruption etc.). Many studies point out that humans went through such genetic bottleneck.

2. such a genetic bottleneck, reducing the total population to a mere few thousands of interbreeding pairs, qualifies as close to ""endangered species"", [according to the official definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species#Criteria_for_.27Endangered_.28EN.29.27_.5B7.5D).

3. and when geneticists conclude that genetic diversity among humans is very small, [they *really* mean very small](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2012-03-02-chimps-show-much-greater-genetic-diversity-humans). The genetic diversity in humans *over all continents* is SMALLER than among two chimpanzee populations from different habitats found in the same country (Cameroon), *separated only by a river*. The same has been found among bonobo populations in Guinee.

4. even more, of all genetic variance in humans, 85% is due to differences *among individuals of the same continental population*, whereas differences between continental groups account for only 10% of the overall genetic variance (the remaining 5% due to other factors). That means the total inter-continental, genetic diversity is only 10% of the human genome. A genome that in itself is already small in diversity.

5. several genetic studies, [including this one](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/602.full) and [this one](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/9/1679.full), both also further referring to many other similar studies, show that indeed there are gene variants that can be traced back to particular continental groups. But often one particular gene variant points out to more than 1 continental group. Moreover, a gene variant A may be linked to continental group X while gene variant B to continental group Y. 

6. To account for subspecies though, we expect at least **a whole bunch of gene variants** to link to the same continental group. To make things worse, applying different genetic markers, will link the same gene variant A to different continental groups. And so on. The boldly marked phrase above is the quintessence most people simply don't get. 

7. this general pattern, as observed, made geneticists to drop altogether the idea that within human population subspecies (""races"") are distinguishable. ""Races"" in human populations do not exist genetically spoken.

8. moreover the very most of genetic variance in humans [is found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953791) ([also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067985/)) *within* the sub-Saharan population. This [also applies to phenotype variance](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070718140829.htm) (phenotype is the composite of an organism's observable characteristics or traits, such as its morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, behavior, and products of behavior (such as a bird's nest)). In Sub-Saharan Africa (~12% of the total world population) more than 2,000 distinct ethnolinguistic groups live, representing nearly a third of the world’s languages. *If* races exist among humans, purely based on genetic variance, some 5 must be found within the Sub-Saharan population, the *rest of the world* constituting the 6th one. You see the problem here.

9. also many traits associated with ""race"" changed last few tens of thousands considerably. The evidence that the early European population was rather *dark*-skinned up to no more than ~8,500 years ago, starts to grow [as DNA studies show](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/03/13/016477.full.pdf).

t1_feaoxmq,t3_enu9p0,"Fitness, defined as reproductive output, is a concept that wasn't introduced to evolutionary theory until 50 years after Spencer and Darwin used the phrase survival of the fittest. Both of those guys clearly and very explicitly used fittest to mean having the most beneficial traits for an environment, as explained in the rest of the Wikipedia introduction after the part you quoted.

Interpretting it in this phrase as a reference to the much later technical concept of fitness would make ""survival of the fittest"" much too broad. Like I said, it wouldn't refer just to natural selection anymore, it would apply to any form of selection as well as genetic drift. It has always been used as a description of natural selection, though. You'd never hear someone call genetic drift survival of the fittest, because we know we're not talking about reproductive success when we use the phrase.

I agree that it can only mean the most beneficial out of the existing variation, though. Fitness is relative to other organisms, not absolute. That's true whichever definition of fittest/fitness you use.",1578952159
t1_fe95u8o,t3_enu9p0,"Biological fitness is defined as reproductive success. Full stop. It does not describe how optimal a given adaptation or organism is.

&gt; ""Survival of the fittest"" is a phrase that originated from Darwinian evolutionary theory as a way of describing the mechanism of natural selection. The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as ""Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations.""

which is pretty much exactly what I said. If you can find a contradictory explanation/definition from a better source, I'd be interested in seeing it.

Natural selection is a local optimizing process, but it is not, and cannot be, a global one unless you have a near infinite population with all ""possible"" variants present at high enough frequency that they can't go extinct. Or if fitness landscapes (in the sense of evolutionary algorithms, not biological fitness) are monotonic with respect to natural selection and reproduction, which, given that sign epistasis exists, is pretty trivially not the case.

t3_eo1bed,t3_eo1bed,"You and your colleague would benefit from a more careful consideration of the terminology you're using.

""Sub-species"" is a formal taxonomic rank. There are no formally recognized sub-species of *Homo sapiens*, which means that all living humans belong to the same grouping at the sub-species level. Sometimes a subspecies *Homo sapiens sapiens* is used to emphasize this, but that name really only has meaning if other named subspecies exist and they do not.

""Breed"" means something totally different, though. It's not an equivalent term to ""sub-species."" Breeds refer to variation in domesticated animals that result specifically from selective breeding. I've heard different accounts about whether there was any selective breeding of black slaves in the New World, there may have been, but even if there was the term breed still can't be applied to the descendants of Causasians, East Asians, or even Africans as a whole.

""Race"" is another term that again has a different meaning. In a biological context it refers to variation within a species associated with geography or ecology but without a formal place in taxonomy. The variation may be caused by either natural selection or genetic drift. It's equivalent in many ways to other terms used to refer to variation within species like ecotype, morph, or variety. These are all forms of what's called structured variation. Variation within a species is said to be structured when knowing something about the environment allows us to predict something about an organism's genetics or vice versa. Unstructured variation is randomly distributed, so doesn't allow predictions.

There's certainly structured variation within humans. Products like 23andMe rely on it as do many medical screens. Genetic structure tends to be found at many hierarchical scales, though, from individual family lineages through regional and ethnic groups through larger groups like sub-species or races and ultimately even to the species and genus levels.

So the real question is whether there's any significant variation in humans at a siimlar scale to the traditionally identified races. There's not really any agreement on exactly how many races of humans there's supposed to be or what they are, but the scale is apparent. Something like 4-6 races. There does seem to be genetic structure at this scale for humans. Research has supported the Sahara Desert, Himalayas, and Bering Strait as geographic features associated with human genetic structure. The problem is really that the genetic clusters at this scale are not especially well-matched to any of the popular conceptions of the races. There's some overlap, but also a lot of inconsistency. Rather than trying to redefine ""race,"" some researchers have preferred to refer to these as ""continental groups,"" which is obviously not very accurate either, but at least gets the scale across.

Maybe more importantly, the structure at this scale (continental groups, races, etc.) is just not all that pronounced and so doesn't allow us to make strong predictions. There's much more biologically informative structure when we look at smaller scales, like those that might be associated with ethnicity. This has also been called ""regional variation"" since current ethnicities are not perfectly aligned to this level of structure just like race isn't perfectly aligned with the continental variation.

&gt; the evidence shows that mixed race humans tend to have less genetic diseases on average, which you wouldn't expect to see if we were actual different breeds/sub-species.

I'm not aware of the research you're referring to, but it would not be unexpected for the offspring of different genetic lines to have more robust phenotypes. This is very common actually. It's called heterosis and results from higher genetic diversity in the offspring of diverged lineages.

If there was no structured variation in humans, the expectation should obviously be that the children of mixed-race parents would be statistically indistinguishable from children of same-race parents.",1578941842

In layman's terms, no.

The level of genetic variation between the traditionally defined continental races isn't large enough to surpass a ""subspecies threshold""

&gt; Table 2 confirms the reality of race in chimpanzees using the threshold definition, as 30.1% of the genetic variation is found in the among-race component, a result expected from the pairwise analysis shown in Table 1. In contrast to chimpanzees, the five major “races” of humans account for only 4.3% of human genetic variation – well below the 25% threshold. The genetic variation in our species is overwhelmingly variation among individuals (93.2%)

&gt;The threshold definition also requires sharp genetic boundaries between the “races.” ...The gene flow arising from long-range migrations and isolation-by-distance has obscured any sharp boundaries that may have temporarily existed after the founder events (Figure 2) as well as has reduced the quantitative amount of genetic differentiation. Consequently, neither aspect of the threshold definition is satisfied; there are no sharp boundaries separating human populations, and the degree of genetic differentiation among human groups, even at the continental level, is extremely low. Using the threshold definition, there are no races in humans.

and they don't exist as independently evolving populations

&gt;Turning to the lineage definition, Figure 2 is consistent with an isolation-by-distance pattern
and not a tree-like structure. Hence, using the same criteria for rejecting the racial status of
the traditionally named subspecies of chimpanzees from equatorial Africa, the existence of
human races as evolutionary lineages is similarly rejected... Figure 2 reveals that human genetic distances fit an isolation-by-distance model. Consequently, it is not surprising that when Behar et al. (2010) sampled Old World populations more finely and used the computer program STRUCTURE, most individuals showed significant genetic inputs from two or more populations, indicating that most human individuals have mixed ancestries and do not belong to a “pure” group. The “races” so apparent to many who cited Rosenberg et al. (2002) simply disappeared with better sampling

&gt;On a time scale of tens of thousands of years (the temporal resolution of the MLNCPA studies), there is not one statistically significant inference of splitting during the last 1.9 million years. Hence, the null hypothesis of a single human lineage is not rejected, so there is no evidence for lineage races in humans. Furthermore, ML-NCPA strongly rejects the null hypotheses of no gene flow and no admixture under the null hypothesis that isolated lineages did exist, so there is strong evidence against lineage races in humans. Hence, there are no races in humans under the lineage definition.",1578927421

t1_fe6di6x,t3_enwx9m,"**Effective population size**

The effective population size is the number of individuals that an idealised population would need to have in order for some specified quantity of interest to be the same in the idealised population as in the real population. Idealised populations are based on unrealistic but convenient simplifications such as random mating, simultaneous birth of each new generation, constant population size, and equal numbers of children per parent. In some simple scenarios, the effective population size is the number of breeding individuals in the population. However, for most quantities of interest and most real populations, the census population size N of a real population is usually larger than the effective population size Ne.

**Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model**

The Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model, also known as Dobzhansky-Muller Model, is a model of the evolution of genetic incompatibility, important in understanding the evolution of reproductive isolation during speciation and the role of natural selection in bringing it about. The theory was first described by William Bateson in 1909, then independently described by Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1934, and later elaborated in different forms by Herman Muller,  H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets.The Dobzhansky-Muller model describes the negative epistatic interactions that occur between genes with a different evolutionary history. These genetic incompatibilities can occur when populations are hybridising. When two populations diverge from a common ancestor and become isolated from each other, thus meaning there is no interbreeding between the two, mutations can accumulate in both populations.

***

**Genetic drift**

Genetic drift (also known as allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect) is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.

t1_fe6afto,t3_enwx9m,"&gt; Just think about how many coding differences, including new ones, there are between us and the common ancestor that us and chimpanzees trace our lineage to. You'd be seeing people with 2 eyes, 3 eyes, 4 eyes, 5 eyes, testicles growing under their ears, the left side of the body covered in scales, the right side with hide, anuses that lead to nowhere on the top of their feet, I'm talking like abominations.

Evolution is *much* more incremental than it sounds like you believe it to be. Some of those types of mutations *do* occur, especially for things like being born with one or no eyes, or three, body parts growing in the wrong places, etc. They're rare, but if you think they don't happen I suspect you haven't really looked. As for scales, that's not going to happen because as far as I'm aware, we don't possess genes that are necessary for *that* dramatic a difference in skin development to occur. We're not talking a single mutation being necessary, but probably hundreds in very specific areas of our genomes. If strong selection for tougher skin were applied for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it could probably happen. But it will never happen suddenly in a single generation.

Additionally, developmental pathways in modern animals generally consist of sets of related developmental genes which occur in varying numbers. When a group of them get duplicated, you get an additional body part relatively close to where the original one was. So if you do look for cases where spurious organs are formed, you'll typically find that the extra one is pretty close to where the ""normal"" one would be. Again, it'd take a *ton* of mutations to get an extra anus on the foot or testes next to an ear compared to getting an extra ear on the side of the head or a spurious anus (probably without a hole) near the functional one. Fun fact, a lot of people have extra, half-formed nipples on their chests. Most of the time they look like a little blemish or a mole or a small patch of hair, and it'd take an expert to really say whether it is just a ""normal"" skin abnormality or an under-developed nipple.

&gt; There are 8 billion people on this planet, and they are all just about the same. There's some minor differences, but you do not see a lot of variety. If evolution was taking the amount of shots in the dark it would take to bring about the biodiversity you see today, you'd see a lot more variety in the population, and yet, you don't.

There are two issues here. First, the amount of variation in humans is small because we went through a population bottleneck sometime in the past few hundred thousand years, where the entire population of our ancestors got down to a few thousand individuals. It wasn't until the past few tens of thousands of years that our census population size started growing, and only the past hundred years or so where billions became a number to describe the number of people that are alive. While mutations are always happening, each person only has somewhere around 50-100 new mutations that their parents didn't. Out of a bit more than 3 billion base pairs. Even now our [effective population size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_population_size) is only on the order of 10,000 individuals. By comparison, chimpanzees (who did not go through a bottleneck as recently as we did) have an effective population size of 20,000 individuals.

Are there enough people that pretty much every possible mutation is going to occur multiple times across the population every generation? Yes. Are most of these mutations pretty much non-functional? Also yes. Most of the types of changes you want to see would require at least tens of mutations across some very specific genes. While our population can produce each of those mutations individually, it takes time for them to accrue and mix and match in the population to the point where meaningful physical changes are noticeable.

Put more simply, evolution really happens and is driven by existing variants mixing and matching in the population over hundreds or thousands of generations. It does *not* really happen due to completely new mutations immediately producing an entirely new phenotype or structure.

&gt; It takes significant enough change in traits that members of two different populations can no longer breed and produce fertile offspring + an environment that allows survival of changed traits in order for speciation to occur and stick. 

I would agree, though I'm curious what you think ""significant"" means specifically.

&gt; Generally, when a group of members of a species becomes separated from the original population, their numbers are going to be slim.

What is the basis for that assumption?

&gt; And yet, you are telling me that somehow, when that group settles in its new home and starts having children, that just the right changes, which fit the new environment, which makes them different enough from the original population that they can no longer breed with the original population and produce fertile offspring, manage to happen in enough of members of the species, and that this has happened over, and over, and over, and over, since at least the Cambrian? I'm sorry, but that's just absurd when evolution is just taking shots in the dark and having to experiment with so many different components. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's highly improbable.

What? No. That's ridiculous. Speciation almost certainly doesn't occur due to adaptions to their new environment. That would only happen if the two populations are still overlapping to some degree and there is selection against hybrids. Speciation (edit: between two truly isolated populations) happens because a sequence of mutations that are neutral within populations occur that aren't ""tested"" against an independent sequence of neutral mutations in the other population, and over time those otherwise ""neutral"" mutations accrue independently to the point where they are no longer compatible between the populations. Most speciation has little to do with the high level physical changes you observe accruing. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateson%E2%80%93Dobzhansky%E2%80%93Muller_model

&gt; This is just common sense and logic; the smaller a population is, the more prounced effect positive or negative events, changes, and designs will have on that population.

First off, common sense isn't real. Don't rely on it as an argument. Second, you're flat out wrong here. It's well known and well established that random events (i.e. [drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift)) has a *much* stronger impact in small populations than large ones. While natural selection (i.e. how good/bad a trait or mutation is) is much more effective and efficient in large populations.",1578887727

So are there differences in developmental gene sequences that affect how many chambers are produced? Certainly there are.

There is a common misconception that evolution is an optimization procedure and thus produces optimal structures. This is completely false. Evolution is process which searches solution spaces, and natural selection causes that search process to stick around at solutions that are ""good enough"". There are a ton of ""good enough"" solutions to pretty much any biological problem, which can readily be seen when you start comparing structures with similar function across very distantly related lineages. The heart is an excellent example of this.""

Good point, my apologies for using optimal. I was aware that evolution works via ""good enough"", not ""optimal.""

""So a big part of why you are struggling to understand how evolution works is that you are looking at the probability of all the specific outcomes we observe, and concluding that it all must have happened exactly this way and no other way. This is not a good perspective. Rather you need to understand that there are many many many possible ways that evolution could have occurred, and the patterns of diversity that exist today are just one random roll of the dice among the huge number of possibilities.""

Mmm, I don't know if this is entirely accurate. I don't think I'm saying ""It couldn't have been any other way."" I think more what my hangup is, is that if evolution is a blind, undirected process taking shots in the dark, in order to bring about the biodiversity we have today, it would have to do a lot of tinkering and experimenting, it couldn't just ""sit back"" and keep doing the same things over and over again. And yet, complex organisms have so many different components, processes, structures, etc, and so in order to find the right combinations that are good enough to survive in a given environment, it would have to do a lot of tinkering, and yet, there's not a lot of tinkering going on in, there's not a lot of variety and bizarre mutations within a given species' living population at any given moment.

Just think about how many coding differences, including new ones, there are between us and the common ancestor that us and chimpanzees trace our lineage to.

That's not to say it couldn't arrive at where we are today, just that it arriving at where we are today just taking shots in the dark with so many different aspects of an organism's blueprint with the number of members of a population that we see with most species at any given time seems improbable. If it had huge numbers to work with, then it wouldn't seem all that improbable.

""I think you are under-estimating how often spontaneous early abortions (i.e. miscarriages) occur. It's been estimated that somewhere around 20% of human pregnancies result in miscarriages, just that a lot of them happen so early that the woman doesn't even know she was pregnant. Other animals likely have similar numbers. The weird and bizarre mutations you are expecting to see absolutely do occur, but usually they are fatal before the animal is born or even very developed past a zygote, which is why you don't see them walking around.""

Good point, but that still leaves us with so many components which aren't fatal early on if they aren't good enough, for evolution to keep wildly experimenting with, and yet, we don't see that in just about any animal, human or otherwise.

There are 8 billion people on this planet, and they are all just about the same. There's some minor differences, but you do not see a lot of variety. If evolution was taking the amount of shots in the dark that would be required to bring about the biodiversity you see today, you'd see a lot more variety in the population, and yet, you don't.

And yet, you are telling me that somehow, when that group settles in its new home and starts having children, that evolution manages to make enough of the right changes which work for the new environment and which makes them different enough from the original population that they can no longer breed with the original population and produce fertile offspring, and manages not to make enough of the wrong changes, and that somehow this has happened over, and over, and over, and over throughout history since at least the Cambrian? I'm sorry, but that's just absurd when evolution is just taking shots in the dark and having to experiment with so many different components. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's highly improbable.

Think about it like this:

I have a species, call it Alfa. A group of members of Alfa become reproductively isolated from the main population via geography; we'll call this group Alfa-1. Then, another group of members of Alfa become reproductively isolated from the main population via geography; we'll call this group Alfa-2.

Alfa-1 has 100,000 members.

Alfa-2 has 1 trillion members.

If I'm evolution and taking shots in the dark, in order to get Alfa-1 and Alfa-2 so different that they are each unable to produce fertile offspring with members of the main population of Alfa, and thus create two new species, I'm going to have to do all kinds of tinkering. Some of the changes I make will work, some of the changes I make won't. The changes that don't work will have a much bigger impact on Alfa-1 surviving than they will on Alfa-2 survival. This is just common sense and logic; the smaller a population is, the more prounced effect positive or negative events, changes, and designs will have on that population.",1578885434
t1_fe68695,t3_edmtzz,Please explain to me one testable prediction his model of consciousness makes.,1578884320
t1_fe63eml,t3_edmtzz,"&gt;Answer me this - Here's a quote from the article: The “Fitness-only” strategy: In this strategy, the organism makes no attempt to estimate the “true” world state corresponding to each sensory state. Rather it directly computes the expected fitness payoff...How do we know this is possible outside of that simulation? 

Because we know only two basic possible strategies exist outside of the simulation in nature, one in which verdical truth is represented via selection, and one where fitness strategy is selected. I don't mean to be crass, but it doesnt appear that you spent much thought on this, the answers to your questions are implicit in his study.

&gt;How do you estimate fitness without first estimating the world state somewhat accurately? 

Fitness = passing on genes. Don shows how fitness selection itself has no commitment to show us the truth, just enough truth so we can survive and mate.

&gt;Of course it's possible in the simulation because the organisms are just simulated functions that have access to the fitness information.

? They are competing against organisms that have the verdical function. If you are going to question evolutionary game theory, I can't argue with you. However, if you accept evolutionary game theory, then there is only one logical conclusion.

&gt;Here's what I'd say about this. In this metaphor, even though the ""deeper"" truth is code, that doesn't mean the top level interface is not causal. My character shoots its gun and another character dies. This is a perfectly reasonable and accurate description of a cause and effect. 

It is perfectly reasonable - in the game. However, you can't determine anything about the hardware of the computer or the underlying code by using the language of the pixels on the screen. The pixels on the screen hide the complexity of the underlying reality, because you dont need to see it or even know that it is there for you to play the game.

&gt;You can describe it on the level of code, that my input is translated through code into graphics depicting a firing of a gun and so on, but that doesn't make the top level description wrong.

I think you are misinterpretting Don's theory, he is not saying the top level description is wrong either, he is only saying it is not the deeper causal reality, which the interface purposefully hides. That is the metaphor. 

&gt;See, this is the issue with this metaphor. You took it too far. You're assuming that studying physics from our current perception of the world is akin to something like figuring out how a processor works from studying MS Outlook. There's just no reason to think that. We are able to study the world and make accurate predictions about how it works, and that means that we're understanding how it works on that level of study.

I'm not assuming anything, I am just communicating Don's theory; and his theory does not state that physics is wrong. he is saying that objects in time and space are remnants of our perception and how evolution shaped perceptions to verdical truth is zero. he also cites contemporary though leaders in physics who also believe time and space is doomed in a unified theory.

&gt;Or laws of physics don't ""break down"", and you may be confusing scientific issues. ""Unified theories"" is what physicists call it when we arrive at a model that explains multiple phenomena previously thought to be separate. One example is electricity and magnetism (which we now call electromagnetism). If you already knew all that, apologies if that sounded condescending. 

?? I am very clear where laws of physics break down when we attempt unification of our theories, please dont turn a non controversial comment into a unnecessary debate on something we agree on. ""break down"" is my word choice, it would be more correct to say that both QM and Relativity cannot both be true in a singularity, at least one of them is wrong.

&gt;Secondly, the fact that we don't have an explanation for consciousness yet does not mean physics breaks down. 

That's not what is being suggested. As physics seeks a unified theory, the idea of ""time and space is doomed"" is an intrinsic issue top scientists are facing, so this is not even his original scientific thinking. https://pswscience.org/meeting/the-doom-of-spacetime/

&gt;To even put consciousness in the realm of physics rather than neurobiology is a leap (one that Deepak Chopra and Don make gleefully at every turn).

I'm not sure its a leap to put it in physics at all, there is a branch of physics called psycho physics, and consciousness is amendable to mathematics.  I think you mean to separate consciousness from neurobiology is a leap. And that is the point, Don's theory is saying that the hard problem of consciousness is not solvable because the deeper underlying reality is not physicalism. It is impossible to model consciousness and boot it up from physical states, and that is why the science has stopped on consciousness without making much progress. I can understand that seems counter intuitive - but his argument and formula offers something that can be dissected at least, and it does solve the hard problem of consciousness.

&gt; I have no idea how you can claim his hypothesis is falsifiable.

Well, its not my claim, it is his. Why is it hard to understand? He has a working mathematical of consciousness that offers predictions, hence testable. he mentions these predictions frequently.

I hope you understand I am not arguing that his hypothesis is true. I don't know - however as someone who is deeply interested in the philosophical and scientific study around consciousness, intelligence, etc and especially the hard problem, this guy is the first exciting thing to come out of the field in a very long time, so that is why I am investing time in understanding the critiques against it.",1578883908
t3_enu9p0,t3_enu9p0,Because there is diversity within a population? Were you expecting all members of a population to be clones? Also personality develops through a combination of genetics and lived experience. Identical twins (clones) don't have identical personalities.,1578883072
t3_enwx9m,t3_enwx9m,"&gt; How did evolution arrive at the optimal number of chambers?

Why are you assuming our heart is optimal? Most reptiles (including birds) and amphibians have a much different circulatory system, with a heart that has 3 chambers, not four. In fact, in many ways their circulatory system is much more efficient than ours. The structure of fish hearts are also very different from ours. Invertebrates don't even *have* hearts. So are there differences in developmental gene sequences that affect how many chambers are produced? Certainly there are.

There is a common misconception that evolution is an optimization procedure and thus produces optimal structures. This is completely false. Evolution is process which searches solution spaces, and natural selection causes that search process to stick around at solutions that are ""good enough"". There are a *ton* of ""good enough"" solutions to pretty much any biological problem,  which can readily be seen when you start comparing structures with similar function across very distantly related lineages. The heart is an excellent example of this.

So a big part of why you are struggling to understand how evolution works is that you are looking at the probability of all the specific outcomes we observe, and concluding that it all must have happened exactly this way and no other way. This is not a good perspective. Rather you need to understand that there are many many *many* possible ways that evolution could have occurred, and the patterns of diversity that exist today are just one random roll of the dice among the huge number of possibilities.

&gt; If a given population member's heart is not put together sufficiently well enough for it to live, that member will obviously not survive, and not have offspring. When evolution is taking shots in the dark, and there are so many components, the vast majority of population members would be failures in the sense that they are unable to survive and unable to make offspring who can then breed themselves.

&gt; And yet, in reality, we see many species who never have large population numbers, and yet somehow, most of them manage to be healthy and well put together enough to survive, with failures being on the left side of the bell curve. Also, in reality, you see very little ""tinkering"" in a given species' population.

I think you are under-estimating how often spontaneous early abortions (i.e. miscarriages) occur. It's been estimated that somewhere around 20% of human pregnancies result in miscarriages, just that a lot of them happen so early that the woman doesn't even know she was pregnant. Other animals likely have similar numbers. The weird and bizarre mutations you are expecting to see absolutely do occur, but usually they are fatal before the animal is born or even very developed past a zygote, which is why you don't see them walking around.",1578881176
t1_fe5jp9i,t3_edmtzz,"Answer me this - Here's a quote from the article:
&gt;The “Fitness-only” strategy: In this strategy, the organism makes no attempt to 
estimate the “true” world state corresponding to each sensory state. Rather it directly 
computes the expected fitness payoff...

How do we know this is possible outside of that simulation? How do you estimate fitness without first estimating the world state somewhat accurately? Of course it's possible in the simulation because the organisms are just simulated functions that have access to the fitness information.

&gt;...it is NOT true if you want to view the actual causal reality behind the video game.

Here's what I'd say about this. In this metaphor, even though the ""deeper"" truth is code, that doesn't mean the top level interface is not causal. My character shoots its gun and another character dies. This is a perfectly reasonable and accurate description of a cause and effect. You can describe it on the level of code, that my input is translated through code into graphics depicting a firing of a gun and so on, but that doesn't make the top level description wrong. 

&gt;&gt;You can still see how the physics engine works by observing objects, for example, and you may even be able to write equations describing those top-level phenomena that may come really close to the code itself. You can actually try it yourself, platform games have a pretty rudimentary physics engine that you can try to estimate based on observing and playing the game. You can get pretty close to how the code works.

&gt;Honestly, I find Don's model far more plausible and non controversial than what you are suggesting - that somehow one can figure out the laws of physics from opening their email program just doesnt seem reasonable to me.

See, this is the issue with this metaphor. You took it too far. You're assuming that studying physics from our current perception of the world is akin to something like figuring out how a processor works from studying MS Outlook. There's just no reason to think that. We are able to study the world and make accurate predictions about how it works, and that means that we're understanding how it works on that level of study.

&gt;...our laws of physics break down when it comes to a unified theory and a model of consciousness - which is the impetus for Don's theory in the first place.

Or laws of physics don't ""break down"", and you may be confusing scientific issues. ""Unified theories"" is what physicists call it when we arrive at a model that explains multiple phenomena previously thought to be separate. One example is electricity and magnetism (which we now call electromagnetism). If you already knew all that, apologies if that sounded condescending. Secondly, the fact that we don't have an explanation for consciousness yet does not mean physics breaks down. To even put consciousness in the realm of physics rather than neurobiology is a leap (one that Deepak Chopra and Don make gleefully at every turn).


&gt;? Are you suggesting this is something that either Don or I have somehow failed to grasp? If you read his paper, the entire point of his exercise is having a mathematical formula specifically to offer proofs and falsifiability for an actual working model of consciousness, which physicalism hasn't delivered on, by the way. His entire exercise is to be as precise as possible, so peer review can show where he is precisely wrong.

I'm not sure how what you're saying here relates to what you were commenting to, but I'll just respond to what you write. I have no idea how you can claim his hypothesis is falsifiable. Again, I couldn't care less about the math. You could be developing mathematical models about how many of Jehovah's divine sperm had to make it to Mary's womb and what paths they need to take. That doesn't prove immaculate conception.
How is this falsifiable? We can barely define consciousness, how are you going to prove or falsify that an electron is conscious? The fact that physicalism (i.e, real science) hasn't delivered on something doesn't lend credence to anything else.",1578880893

Well, it's all (or at least *mostly*) about the mutations, isn't it?

When you talk about the probability of a mutation occurring, are you talking about the probability that the mutation will occur *in any one specific critter*, or are you talking about the probability that the mutation will occur *at all, in* ***any*** *critter?* These are rather different probabilities.

&gt;I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous. And yet, that is not the case.

Well… evolution *did* produce those weird-ass critters. And they presumably got outcompeted by ""conventional"" critters. So I'm not really sure what your point is?",1578880525
t3_enwx9m,t3_enwx9m,"&gt; Here's why I think that: Even in organisms with massive population numbers, the blind process of evolution simply has not had enough opportunities to take shots in the dark and tinker to successfully bring to bear all the components of a given species' body.

People *grossly* underestimate just how long life has existed on this planet. [This video gives you a better idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI7SbZx_Qiw) of just how many chances and how much opportunity life has had to evolve. The short answer is we have had plenty of time to evolve.

Another thing to consider that is easily missed: The earth isn't special. 

I mean, obviously it's special *to us*, because we evolved here, but if we had evolved on some other planet, it would be  that planet that is special to us, not the earth. So when you consider the number of opportunities, you have to consider the whole universe.

So how many possible planets could we have evolved on? The latest evidence says a lot. Estimates say there are between 200 billion and 2 trillion galaxies in the universe. Each galaxy has around 100 billion stars. That means *conservatively* there are about 20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000-- 20 sextillion-- stars in the universe and possibly an order of magnitude more. That means that **if even 1 in a billion stars has a hypothetically habitable planet that would mean there would be 20 trillion potential planets we could have evolved on.** And the latest research into extra-solar planets suggests that number is probably a lot closer to 1 in a hundred than one in a billion.

Put simply, life has had plenty of opportunities to evolve. 

Your argument is what is known as an argument from personal incredulity fallacy. ""I just can't believe it's true, so it must be false!"" Now I realize you aren't actually saying it is false, you are just questioning it. And that's great, it is exactly what you should be doing. But you still need to be aware that you are using fallacious reasoning, and realize the limits of it's utility: Incredulity is a good reason to *question*, it is not a good reason to *deny*. 

&gt; I once saw someone talk about how before the Cambrian explosion, evolution was still basically experimenting a lot with various setups, body plans, etc, with nightmarish and trippy sea creatures with eyes on top of their head, a probiscus-like extension that would get food in front of it and bring it up OVER the head and then into its backward-facing mouth tucked under the back of its head, etc. So, what I am talking about with what you would expect to see with evolution being a blind process is something like this, except even more chaotic, weird, nightmarish, and disastrous. And yet, that is not the case.

The Cambrian explosion is often cited by creationists as evidence against evolution. It's not at all, they just misunderstand it. 

First off, it's not an explosion. It took something like 20 million years. That is a *lonnnnnggg* time.Again, watch the video I linked above. 

Second, it's not as much of an explosion as it first seems. life was already fairly well diversified before the CE, it is just that the life before the CE did not have bodies that had skeletons, so they had no body parts that could become fossilized under the typical conditions (which are already increidbly unlikely-- [see my comment here from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/engh1b/a_question_about_extinct_species/fdzpjle/)). We have an explosion of new species *in the fossil record*, because the fossil record itself was new (for the most part).

But as for your question, most of those weird ""experiments"" are due to the rapidly changing conditions at the time. Rapid change in the environment leads to rapid evolution. But rapid evolution doesn't mean the evolutionary ""experiments"" will be viable in the long term. Evolution ""tried"" various models, but those things were less efficient in the long term compared with others, so those species became extinct.

t1_fe05d0u,t3_edmtzz,"Hi, thanks for your reply. I've been spending lots of time with his theory so working through it in discussion is helpful.

&gt;This conclusion is in no way simple, nor is it valid in my opinion. He bases this argument on a simulation (detailed here http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/FitnessBeatsTruth_apa_PBR) that does pretty poorly to actually simulate anything real.

I'm just not seeing that from what you are arguing against here, and I want to understand reasoned rebuttals against his theory.


&gt;If one of your strategies is straight up optimize for fitness, and the other is doing that but with other limitations, of course the one optimizing just for fitness is going to have the highest fitness.

I think that is exactly what he is suggesting, evolution optimizes for highest fitness, and we have assumed fitness = verdical perception so it is hard to see how that invalidates his model.

&gt;The question is, does this represent anything real? 

That is exactly his question for his proof, and after running hundreds of thousands of simulations pitting fitness strategy versus verdical strategy, verdical was outcompeted in all them.

&gt;I would say that they haven't done enough to show that. For example, it may very well be impossible to predict the fitness of a behavior without your inner model of reality approximating its true nature, making the fitness-only strategy impossible. This is just one possible way to put a kink in their conclusion.

I'm not sure how what you are suggesting is not already implied in their simulations, it is specifically why they pitted ""select for reality as it is"" versus ""select for fitness"". If what you are saying is true, then one of them would not have outcompeted the other and they would have tracked similarly.

&gt;The problem is that the way he is using the metaphor is flawed and misleading. Let's take his video game example. You would agree that as a character in a simulated world like a video game, you're not peering into the ""true nature of your world"" unless you see the code, basically. However, that doesn't mean that the top level user interface isn't 'true' on some level. 

Again, that is exactly what Don is saying, it is true on one level, but it is NOT true if you want to view the actual causal reality behind the video game.

&gt;You can still see how the physics engine works by observing objects, for example, and you may even be able to write equations describing those top-level phenomena that may come really close to the code itself. You can actually try it yourself, platform games have a pretty rudimentary physics engine that you can try to estimate based on observing and playing the game. You can get pretty close to how the code works.

Honestly, I find Don's model far more plausible and non controversial than what you are suggesting - that somehow one can figure out the laws of physics from opening their email program just doesnt seem reasonable to me.

&gt;This is exactly what science does. Every hypothesis that you can reliably make accurate predictions with is true on some level. Newtonian physics isn't ""just an interface"" because general relativity explains gravity on a deeper level.

All ideas or theories are an interface of reality if you want to continue to use a metaphor you don't like - but this isn't relevant really because you're not contradicting Don here, and currently, our laws of physics break down when it comes to a unified theory and a model of consciousness - which is the impetus for Don's theory in the first place.

&gt;There's literally zero reasons to think that's impossible. That's how science is done. You don't start from scratch and hope your made up framework just has the rest of science emerge from it. You build a hypothesis based on current observations, make predictions and then test them.

t3_enu9p0,t3_enu9p0,"Is there some specific reason that you're aksing about differences in personality rather than other types of differences among individuals? The way you asked the question, it could equally refer to any type of variation at all. In general, there's several reasons why species have variation in spite of the optimizing effect of natural selection.

First of all, biological natural selection can only act on genetic variation, but the trait variation we actually see is only partially determined by genetics. Environmental influences have major effects on most traits, including just about all personality traits. So even if every individual had exactly the same underlying genetic determinants of personality, we would still see variation due to the different environments and experiences that shape their behavior.

However, even considering the genetic component, there's no reason to expect that natural selection will lead to a single optimal trait. The trait values (whether for personality or another trait) that lead to the highest fitness often vary through time and space. The physical environment changes, interactions withother organisms change, and interactions with other individuals of your own species change. So what's beneficial here and now may not be beneficial in the context of another time or place. These are all various forms of what's called balancing selection, which is a type of natural selection that favors the maintenance of variation in a population rather than its removal.

Finally, there are other mechanisms of evolution aside from natural selection. Genetic drift may allow sub-optimal trait values to have higher fitness than the most optimal values under certain demographic scenarios, which can lead to a selection-drift balance. Meanwhile, mutation and gene flow can both introduce new variation even in situations where natural selection continuously acts to remove it.

In a ""trait"" as complex as personality, probably all of these factors are present simultaneously.",1578868107

The list goes on and on. Let's mention the lungfish or even platypuses. 

Now, the example you gave sounds a lot like the evolution of giraffes. In that case it's pretty obvious why they have such long necks. The trees evolve taller in order not to be eaten and at the same time the population of giraffe-like animals develop a longer neck. In that case it's obvious what the _selection pressure_ is pointing towards.
But we gotta keep something in mind: Evolution doesn't have a ""goal"".
Plenty of people belive that transitional species should be seeking towards developing the structures of the animals they are the ancestors of. And that's not true. Animals today are still evolving. Animals now are transitional species and are the ancestors of the animals of the future, and modern animals are just fine living the life they live.

Dinosaur didn't _need to_ lose body mass and develop longer arms so they could fly. They were fine living their life without flight. It's not like they went extinct because they couldn't fly.
Same with whales. They didn't need to lose their legs or become huge animals. They were already just fine living life with kinda useless legs and being not that big.

The actual basalmost spiders are the Mesothelae, which is not disputed at all.

* The genus *Minua* is placed as the sister-group to all harvestmen. This is an outdated name for a genus of armored harvestman now known as *Minuella*. Again, not a mistake of being ""outdated"", since it has always been placed in the suborder Laniatores, with the rest of the armored harvestmen. The actual basalmost harvestmen are the Cyphophthalmi. 

There seem to be fewer of these random taxa thrown around than last time I checked, so maybe they've fixed some, but I don't see any way of tracking their history of editing the tree.

Even if you ignore these randomly-inserted minor taxa (which you shouldn't, because understanding basal lineages is important for understanding the evolutionary history of the entire clade), there are still problems at the order-level:

* Pycnogonids/Pantopods are placed nested *within* the class Arachnida. While the position of Pygnogonids has been debated, I'm not aware of any studies that recover them as arachnids; they are instead thought to be the sister-group of Euchelicerates (arachinds+horseshoe crabs), or maybe an even earlier-diverging arthropod lineage. 

* Schizomids are placed as the basalmost order of arachnids. All studies (that I'm aware of) have recovered Schizomids as the sister-group to Thelyhonida; as a matter of fact, in the past, these two orders were commonly grouped together as a single order, Uropygi, and this relationship is one of the only rock-solid order-level relationships arachnid taxonomists actually agree on (the placement of many arachnid orders is uncertain), so I don't understand why Onezoom puts them here.

* Harvestmen are placed nested within the clade Anactinotrichida (Opilioacariformes+Parasitiformes). No studies (that I'm aware of) have ever recovered this configuration; although the placement of both harvestmen and Parasitiformes is uncertain, Many taxonomists don't even use the term ""Anactinotrichida"" anymore, and instead just treat Opilioacariformes as an order within Parasitiformes.  

In general, since the placement of many major arachnid groups is not fully resolved, it would be better to use polytomies instead of just randomly clumping together orders which we don't really know where to fit (like Ricinulei and Palpigradi, which are treated as sister-taxa in Onezoom, but certainly aren't).

Regarding harvestman taxonomy:

* The families Phalangodidae and Pyramidopidae are both placed within the superfamily Gonyleptoidea, even though both of these families are totally unrelated to Gonyleptoids, and have *never* been considered to be Gonyleptoids by any taxonomists ever, that I'm aware of. 

* The family Stygnopsidae is placed within the superfamily Epedanoidea, even though it is totally unrelated to Epedanoids; this family has more recently been resolved as a basal lineage of Gonyleptoidea, but as far as I'm aware, has never been grouped with the Epedanoids.

* The Isidiatores are all placed deeply-nested within the infraorder Grassatores, although they're regarded as either the sister-group to Grassatores, or to form a grade of basal lineages preceding the Grassatores.

* Family names like ""Gagrellidae"", ""Leiobunidae"", and ""Monoscutidae"", are used, despite being defunct names no longer used by actual taxonomists. Other (more recent) families, like Acropsopilionidae, Cryptogeobiidae, and Gerdesiidae are absent. You could cite ""outdatedness"" here, and while some of these changes are kinda recent (all of them still at least 5 years old, though), Gagrellidae and Leiobunidae in particular have been treated as subfamilies of Sclerosomatidae since 1992. 

That's a handful of issues, but there are more that I've noticed in harvestmen, and I don't know enough about other arthropod orders to fact-check them, but spiders and mites are certainly rife with similar errors. If you're brave enough to go down to the species-level, nothing makes sense at all (for example, why is *Leiobunum hiasai*, a Japanese species, placed as the sister-species to *Leiobunum apenninicum*, an Italian species, when in fact both of these species belong to different and unrelated formally-named species-groups?); it's obviously totally random, with more of an emphasis on looking pretty than on being correct.

Now, maybe if you look at mammals, it'll be more correct; there's certainly been far more studies done on far fewer species in that group, so it would be much easier to actually get a reliable tree. If you check their ""[data sources](https://www.onezoom.org/data_sources.html)"" tab, they list sources used for several larger groups, but all arthropods (notably- the most diverse lineage of all living organisms) have no ""data source"". Arthropods were clearly thrown together somewhat haphazardly.",1578818425

t1_fe09f2p,t3_engh1b,"It's the pre cambrian era that not many even know about! I've mentioned it even to people who are into paleontology and they dont know about it. But it's amazing. It's basically the period where multicellular like really started to form. The ediacaran fauna is some of the coolest fauna in history! A lot of the fauna had trilateral symmetry vs bilateral, which isnt nearly as prevalent nowadays as most animals and plants typically have only bilateral symmetry as a whole. If you do some research on some of the fauna its amazing! It literally looks like it came straight out of subnautica. Its gorgeous. Such a huge step in earth's history as well. Its basically the leap taken right before the explosion. Some of the oldest organisms besides cyanobacteria and single celled organisms have come out of that period. 

Ah I just love it. If you want to check it out, look up Trilobozoa. They're the ones that are trilaterally symmetrical!",1578816475

t1_fdzzpkw,t3_engh1b,"I'm not very convinced by that theory. Sapiens might have been more successful at breeding than neanderthal, but the small % of foreign dna can easly be from some few crossbreeding incidents, not a full fussion. Plus, I recall that not all modern humans have that dna, or at least the same %",1578813291
t1_fe0g5jl,t3_enkd1v,"&gt; there could still be variation from sexual reproduction. 
  
I thought about that - but, it would not introduce new SNPs, would it? It could select varying combinations from an existing palette, but would be very limited in terms of generating new and novel adaptations. Furthermore, after any sweeps played out, the species would come to vary less and less; existing polymorphisms would slowly be expunged.
  
&gt; There is a literature demonstrating that mutation rates increase in response to stressful conditions.  
  
Thanks!  
I had figured there must be; glad to have it confirmed. I will look up ""mutation rate vs stress""; that sounds like a good search string.",1578813220

t1_fdsg53q,t3_edmtzz,"I wrote a long reply to the other comment, but just to make some sense of things here:

&gt;If you accept evolution is true, then you must accept that the probability you perceive time and space as it truly exists is zero. Since you're not surprised, it probably means you do not comprehend the implications of what that means.

See my comments about his simulation experiment in the other thread. And as opposed to Prof. Hoffman, I'm an actual evolutionary biologist, and I completely reject this claim.

&gt;If you have an issue with his mathematical model of consciousness, then come at it with maths.

I'm sure his math is rock solid. That's not the issue. If a theologist develops perfect mathematical models about how many angels in heaven does it take to change God's lightbulb, that doesn't mean that any of those things exist. He bases those models on the unwarranted assumption that consciousness is everywhere and in everything.",1578803981

Creation,euzput,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,Let's explain: Compound probabilities as they relate to back mutations,"A [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/ffrep0z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) between myself and DarwinZDF42 explored the relationship between probabilities and back mutations. He was insistent that a back mutation was roughly equal in probability to the original, and in so doing he aims to suggest that they are a significant factor to consider which ameliorates the problem of deleterious mutations in the genome. This could not be further from the truth, and I'll try to succinctly explain why using a simple math example.  


Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.

Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.   


Now we can do some very simple math to find out which is more likely-- getting two different mutations, or getting a back mutation of the first mutation in our second mutation.  


The first of the two mutations is not specified--it is random and it could be anything. So the probability of the first mutation is 1. All values equally likely.  


Now for the second mutation. If it is NOT a back mutation, then that means we have only one value which is disallowed: the value that would produce a back mutation. Since the first mutation took one possible value away from us, that leaves us 29 remaining possibilities. That is a likelihood of 29/30.  


Since for compound probabilities we multiply, then the likelihood of getting two mutations and NOT having the second reverse the first would be (1) \* (29/30). We have a high probability of not reversing the first mutation. Notice how the level of certainty that we will NOT get a back mutation only goes up and up the larger the number of possibilities becomes.  


Contrariwise, if we want to see the likelihood of getting two mutations and having the second one reverse the first one ( a back mutation ), we just multiply our two compound probabilities once more, this time inverting the number. We landed on one of the 30 possible choices with mutation #1, and so for the second mutation we have only one possible mutation out of 30 that would result in a back mutation. That's 1/30.   


I hope this simple explanation will suffice to explain why back mutations are so unlikely. In our oversimplified example of a tiny genome of 10 base pairs (compared to 3 billion), the difference in probability for getting a back mutation is the difference of 29/30 versus 1/30 or .967 compared to .033.",57,1580181625,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/
Creation,eupqxz,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,Let's pick apart DarwinZDF42's grand theory of mutations - his answer to Genetic Entropy,"Our friend and neighbor DarwinZDF42 is well known for trashing Dr. John Sanford and his ideas about Genetic Entropy furiously and often. You know you're over the target when you're taking flak!  


Most of what he's written on this topic in the past has been smoke and mirrors, unfortunately. But now, at my request, he has been kind enough to lay his cards on the table openly and explain HIS grand theory of mutational accumulation.  


I want to home in on a few of the most important and salient points he made.  


&gt; There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur. 

This statement plainly runs contrary to science. In reality, the vast majority of all possible mutations are deleterious. The only real variable is *how* deleterious.   


**""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007;Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""**

[**https://www.ge**netics.org/content/204/3/1225](https://www.genetics.org/content/204/3/1225)

Dillon, M. and Cooper, V., The Fitness Effects of Spontaneous Mutations Nearly Unseen by Selection in a Bacterium with Multiple Chromosomes,

GENETICS November 1, 2016 vol. 204 no. 3 1225-1238

**""In summary, the vast majority of mutations are deleterious. This is one of the most well-established principles of evolutionary genetics, supported by both molecular and quantitative-genetic data.""**

Keightley P.D., and Lynch, M., Toward a realistic model of mutations affecting fitness, Evolution, 57(3):683–5, 2003.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations. 

This possibility is so rare and unlikely as to be completely negligible when considering our fitness distribution. Back mutations are like having lighting strike at the same spot twice, since mutations are random and the genome is very, very large.  


Think about this: the human genome contains [3 billion base pairs](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ). What he is saying is that once you change one of these for the worse (most mutations are very small), then it's technically possible that another mutation could come along and hit the same spot and put it back to where it was before.  


Well, yeah, that *could* happen, but it's so vastly unlikely as to be negligible. That explains why this is such a rare phenomenon. In some cases, it may even represent evidence of genomic repair mechanisms that are not yet well understood ([in other words, it may not be random at all](https://creation.com/at-last-a-good-mutation))!  


&gt; The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact. 

DarwinZDF42 isn't clear on why epistasis is supposed to help his case. The fact that mutations interact actually makes the whole problem worse for various reasons. For one thing, synergistic epistasis means they work together. This means that the damage caused by multiple deleterious mutations becomes not just additive, but exponential, as the mutations are worse in combination than they would be apart!  


And then you have antagonistic epistasis, where they work against each other. This makes beneficial mutations *less helpful*, since sometimes a beneficial mutation ceases being beneficial when combined with another beneficial mutation! This is particularly bad considering how rare these types of mutations are to begin with.   


Dr. John Sanford has dealt at length with the problem of epistasis, both in his book and this [exhaustive numerical simulation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0013). Epistasis is simply no way out of the entropy problem.  


&gt; Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated. 

Here he shows that he still does not really understand the problem of genetic entropy. The idea is not that most mutations are unselectable until they reach a certain threshold. Where he got this from I don't know. The idea is that most mutations are unselectable, period. They just keep on damaging things and natural selection keeps on failing to notice them because they are too small.  


**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

&amp;#x200B;

**""In terms of evolutionary dynamics, however, mutations whose effects are very small ... are expected to be dominated by drift rather than selection.""**

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094782](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094782)

The threshold is not at the level of the individual, as even Kimura himself understood. The threshold is at the level of the **population as a whole**. These mutations are happening constantly in every member of the population! Each human being has about 100 new mutations compared to their parents. Selection only works relative to other members of the population, but if everybody is degenerating at roughly the same gradual rate, then selection is powerless to stop this. Do you see DarwinZDF42's attempt at a sleight of hand here?  


I anticipated this a while back when I wrote the following article, published in Creation magazine:  
 **Genetic Entropy: The Silent Killer,** ***Creation*** **41(4):48–50, 2019** 

  
It's not yet published to the website, but I'll quote a short excerpt here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Forced to acknowledge that NS is blind to nearly-neutral mutations, a common evolutionist response is, ‘Once the accumulating damage from the mutations becomes significant, NS will start to remove them.’ But this fails to understand the problem. Natural selection can only weed out individual mutations as they happen. Once mutations have accumulated enough to be a real, noticeable problem, they are then a problem in the entire population, not just in an individual here or there. The whole population cannot be ‘selected away’—except by going extinct!",88,1580140688,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/

I wrote years ago aidea, cool idea but poorly written, a essay called ""POST FLOOD MARSUPIAL MIGRATION EXPLAINED"" by Robert Byers. Just google.

In it I explain that marsupials did not in a group travel to Australia/S america etc and all other creatures refused to travel those ways but instead all creatures filled the earth quickly as God commanded without exception. Therefore the marsupial traits of reproduction or a few antomical details mutually held were just picked upon migration to those areas. The great evidence for this being the OBVIOUS same bodyplan/shape of marsupials with other critters elsewhere. There were marsupial lions, wolves, mice, moles etc etc. The pouch thing was a trivial detail and wrong to classify them by those trivial details. most of organized creationism still does say marsupials were on the ark and joined hands on the march to Aussietopia. An absurdity if one thinks about but they can't imagine how bodyplans could change under envirormental influence. likewise I show that in the fossil record there were other groups of creatures said also to not be related despite perfect bodyplan forms.

Creation,ethnl0,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.Creation,,The RNA World Hypothesis,"The RNA World Hypothesis: The Failure of Modern Origin-of-Life Theories

The RNA world hypothesis is the most developed origin-of-life theories so far, and it tries to explain how information in DNA, metabolism, and life itself originated. However, this post will show the utter failure of this theory to actually explain the origin of life.

The main premise of this theory is that, before the first living cells originated, the prebiotic world was composed of RNA and, later, RNA viruses. As RNA has been seen to self-replicate in some cases, and ribozymes, or catalytic enzymes like polymerases made of RNA, have been shown to exist, it is assumed that RNA could take the place of both DNA and proteins.

Once the first ribozyme polymerase (able to copy other RNA strands) originated, then strands could replicate, and the laws of natural selection and mutation could take over from there. As more and more complex ribozymes began to originate, and simple lipid cell membranes took them into their cavities, then simple metabolism could evolve. After this, ribonucleoproteins such as ribosomes could take over, and finally, simple cellular life could evolve.

The first hurdle that this theory comes to is the chemical evolution of nucleobases (A, U, G, and C). These are the molecules that encode information in DNA and cause ribozymes to work. Although some scientists suggest that specific nucleobases, such as adenine (A) [can be made by natural processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077245/), others accept that [nucleobases are unlikely to be created naturally](https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4396). Even to make a 0.5% concentration of adenine take unrealistically high concentrations of HCN that likely did not exist in early oceans. In our cells, there is a complex sequence of specific, metabolic proteins to make nucleobases. Also, the reaction that makes nucleobases from HCN makes many undesirable products that would interfere with RNA production.

Also, nucleobases have [very short half-lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20907/). At the temperatures of hydrothermal vents (more than 100 degrees Celsius), cytosine has a half-life of only 19 days, which means that the origin of life would have to have take place within only several years. I can’t stress enough how unlikely this would be.

The second hurdle the theory comes to is the making of ribose sugar. Ribose is the first component of the backbone of RNA (and the R in RNA). There is already a natural process that makes this sugar called the [formose reaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) which begins with formaldehyde. This has even been observed to take place at the temperatures and pressures of hydrothermal vents. The only problem with this is that [it cannot take place in the presence of nitrogenous compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453009), such as the ones that are formed from the production of nucleobases, This is because nitrogenous compounds would chemically react with the formaldehyde that is needed to start the reaction.

So, proponents of the RNA world theory need to explain how ribose could be made apart from the nucleobases, then come in contact with them in a high enough concentration to provoke a *thermodynamically uphill reaction*.

This brings us to the theory’s third hurdle, which is the making of nucleotides. These are the fundamental units of RNA, that are made from a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate ion. To form this, there would need to be a high concentration of phosphate. However, because phosphate is an ion, it is generally trapped in stable minerals. Any free PO^-3 will be quickly ‘snapped up’ by free calcium ions in the ocean. Though [some origin-of-life researchers think this could be solved with sulfur](https://cosmosmagazine.com/chemistry/life-without-phosphate-mystery-solved), there is no known analogue to RNA with anything other than phosphate.

Another problem with this is that the combination of nucleobases, ribose, and phosphate is a *thermodynamically uphill* reaction. To make nucleotides would require an outside source of energy and an extremely high concentration of each of these things, which is unlikely for the reasons previously mentioned.

Also, you need to make sure that the right nitrogen atom from the nucleobase bonds with the right carbon atom on the ribose sugar. In studies, only [8% of bonds were in the right place](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar50083a002), showing that even if the molecules did combine to form a nucleotide, 92% of them would be wrong, so any RNA strand formed from these would be extremely unlikely to work.

The final challenge to this theory, and the most problematic, is the actual forming of ribozymes. Even assuming that a significant concentration of nucleotides were formed, there are only a few sequences that actually produce an enzyme, so we run into the same problem as specified information in DNA.

Natural selection and copying could only begin after the first ribozyme polymerase was formed. [The shortest effective one yet is called 24-3](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9786), and it needs a specific sequence of bases 188 nucleotides in length to work. The chance of this forming randomly is one in 4^188, or approximately one in 10^113. Even assuming that the concentration was enough to produce a new RNA sequence every second, the chance of this forming in a million years is still one in 10^99. Given that, at best, life is given a billion years in evolutionary time to form, you can be sure that the RNA world literally would never form “in a billion years”.

They gave some arguments against Genetic Entropy, many of which I believe are even fatal to the theory. These are their arguments, since I know many of you don’t want to read the entire post:

Most mutations are neutral, because deleterious and beneficial mutations only happen in protein-coding genes (this has nothing to do with the junk DNA argument, just a fact). The ones that are deleterious only happen to a small percentage of genes at a time, because there are so many genes in the genome. Since the entire genome isn’t being degraded at once, the wild-type which still exists in the population will survive due to the probabilities of genetic drift. And even if some genes escape genetic drift, once they degrade enough they will be selected against. This means that almost all deleterious mutations are eventually removed from the gene pool by drift.

And: Sanford’s H1N1 study that is said to prove genetic entropy is bad because he simply relabels the virulence axis as fitness, whereas virulence and fitness are completely different things. Any other study said to prove genetic entropy must be misunderstood, because many studies have been done, even on organisms that are supposed to be susceptible to entropy. This shows that mutational meltdown cannot be induced in any modern organisms.

Finally: Any genetic entropy seen today is either due to the effect of humans on other animals, or due to the removal of selective pressures on the human gene pool.

I have since eaten what I can only assume is an unhealthy amount of these delicious fruits.  If you haven't had one, you owe it to yourself to get to your local Asian market and get one..

Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starches to simpler sugars. Only living organisms can produce amylase. Animals produce only alpha-amylase. Plants, bacteria, and fungi produce both beta- and alpha- amylases. Like all proteins, the presence of amylase in food depends on if it is permanently denatured by high enough temperatures or extremes in pH. Interestingly, amylases can be classified into high/intermediate/low thermostability groups, depending on whether they become inactivated at a certain temperature. Taking this into consideration, saliva would definitely have alpha-amylase. Bread and biscuits may have alpha or beta amylase (depending on baking temperatures/pH, if amylase was added at all, and if it comes from a grain).  

If it lives,  it contains amylase.

It means, 'To the Man', and is a deflection *from* whatever the topic is, *to* the opponent.   ..ANYTHING  that puts the focus on the premise MAKER, rather than the premise.

Let's say you post a topic: 
*'Mutation and time have no mechanism for increasing complexity.'*

Here are typical ad hominem responses:

You don't understand! 
You need to read a book!
You are ignorant, and need education!
Why do you deny this settled science?
Liar!
You are religious!
You believe xxx!
You are proselytizing! 
Your motivation is to convert people!
You're a troll!
Spammer!
You refuse!
You ignore!
Your behavior is bad!

ANYTHING that shifts the attention from the FACTS and REASONING of the topic, to some personal attribute or accusation toward the person, is ad hominem.   It is not just cussing someone out,  or an insult laden tirade, it is anything 'to the man', that deflects from the topic.

It has become so common, in the modern discourse,  that it is redefined as a 'rational response' for anything that is disagreed with.  And it is such a critical element of the 'debate' climate, that just pointing out ad hominem will elicit howls of indignation, and doubling down of more ad hominem! 

*You don't even know what ad hom is!
Complainer!
Pointing out ad hom IS ad hom!
You're rude and contentious!*

It has become so mainstream that pointing it out will get you banned, and/or start a dogpile of attacks toward the hapless dupe who dares to expose such an essential weapon in the Militant Evolutionist's arsenal.

In the example above, a RATIONAL, topical response would be to address the facts and reasoning of time and mutation,  as a mechanism for increasing complexity...  without multiple references as to how stupid, uneducated, blind, lying, and illogical the premise maker is.  But in most public forums, especially in the origins debate, that does not happen.   Rarely will you get ANY response that is not steeped in ad hominem,  even when they deny it.

Ad hominem is a poor substitute for reason. But it is the favorite substitute, in the origins debate. It is ..evidence..  imo, of the impotence of science, facts, and reasoning behind the belief in common ancestry.  It REVEALS ignorance, Indoctrination, desperation, intolerance,  and irrationality. It is not a tool of a logical, scientific minded person. It is a fallacy, for someone without facts or reason.

ANY open, public discussion will reveal ad hominem as the most used and common fallacy in the origins debate.",20,1579524916,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ercumb/fallacies_in_the_origins_debate_ad_hominem/
Creation,eqv6m8,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Fallacies in the Origins Debate: Gish Gallop!,"This is a peculiar kind of fallacy,  combining poison the well, ad hominem, and dismissal all together in a cutesy deflection.

It is specifically used in origins debate, to dismiss points made by creationists. Some origins forums even use the term in their rules.

What is it?  It was coined by Eugenie Scott, a common ancestry defender, atheist, and vocal opponent of creationism.

From her article in the the talk.origins faq, on How to debate a creationist:  
*""I think they recognize that they have a lot to lose in any other than the ""Gish Gallop"" format. Tough luck. I can't see any reason why evolutionists should make it easier for them to rally their troops.*  

*If after all of this, you still think you want to debate a creationist, then let me give you some suggestions. First, don't bother defending evolution. Evolution is state of the art science, taught at every decent college and university in this country, including Brigham Young, Notre Dame, and Baylor. So why should you defend it? Tell your audience that there is plenty of information on evolution in the library, in university courses, and in scores of science journals. Creation ""science"" is the new kid on the block. Let's see if it fits the criteria of science, and secondly, if its claims and predictions stand up to scrutiny.*  

*And then show the audience how creation science is a bust. Don't bother trying to explain something as complicated as evolution, although during your rebuttal you can straighten the audience out on the creationist's stupider claims.""*  

She coined the phrase to dismiss the presentations of Duane Gish, an early promoter of creationism from the last century.  He would list multiple points in a debate format, and the complaint is that the evolutionist was overwhelmed with points, unable to give a cogent response to any.

From wiki:  
*The Gish gallop is a technique used during debating that focuses on overwhelming an opponent with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength of the arguments. The term was coined by Eugenie Scott and named after the creationist Duane Gish.*

I personally met Duane Gish, and attended several debates, when academia still allowed that sort of thing (they use censorship,  now..).  He did have a wealth of scientific material and knowledge,  and conveyed it with sound logic.  I see the 'Gish Gallop!' accusation as an unfair and demeaning deflection, with no rational basis.  Here is why:

1. The debate formats are the real complaint.  Duane Gish would present as much facts and arguments as possible, in the allotted time.  The evolutionist debater would (allegedly) feel unable to rebut so many points in the shorter rebuttal time allotment.
2. Rather than deal with the ARGUMENTS and FACTS, the evolutionist debater found it much easier to dismiss it all, as a 'Gish Gallop!'  It is an argument of dismissal. 
3. The irony i see is in the hypocrisy among 'Gish Gallop!' accusers, who often employ a similar tactic of flooding a 'debate' with irrelevant cut and pastes &amp; off topic deflections.
4. Not every point can be made in a bumper  sticker soundbite. To dismiss everything, and complain of being overwhelmed by arguments,  is an admission that the rebuttal is impotent in it's response.

Duane Gish died in 2013, at 92 years of age.  The deflective smear that bears his name is a testament to his convincing, rational, and scientific arguments, that elicited terror and dismissal from his opponents.

A personal note:
I became a creationist after attending debates with Duane Gish and Henry Morris, at a midwestern university in 1974.  Coming from a diverse scientific background in physics,  chemistry, and mathematics,  i was impressed with the facts and arguments that these debaters displayed.  I continued in origins, even joining the 'debate' on talk.origins in the 90s.  When i am accused of 'Gish Gallop!' (and anyone who engages in this debate will be),  i am reminded  of the warmth, wit, humor, and crushing rationality of this great father of modern scientific creationism.  I wear his name as a badge of honor..",9,1579433213,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eqv6m8/fallacies_in_the_origins_debate_gish_gallop/
Creation,eqpzlu,SaggysHealthAlt,Science-Denying Creationist,t2_4h4ws52t,self.Creation,,I wrote a small research paper on a simple proof for a Young Earth meant for laymen. Feel free to critique or the work so I can update it with better information. (I will not respond to anything submitted in r/debateevolution so please respond here),"***Abstract: Carbon 14 dates from numerous samples around the United States suggest a death within the last 95,000 years. Coal formation has been proven to occur at an alarmingly different pace from the secular narrative of hundreds of millions of years, as the evidence shows it can occur in less than a single year. Eyewitness testimony suggests that a massive flood is the culprit for the existence of recently buried excessive amounts of plant life fossilized into the coal beds we witness today.***

**I would like to respond to the assumption that coal took hundreds of millions of years to form. First, this has to do with C14 dating. So if you do not know what that is, here is a science lesson. Carbon 14 is an isotope, or an unstable atom, which is also called radiocarbon. This is created in the Earth’s atmosphere after sun rays react with nitrogen 14 that is already in the atmosphere. The reaction forms carbon 14 which is eventually absorbed into the plants around us on the Earth. These plants are eventually eaten by animals, so the C14 in the plant transfers to the animal. We as humans eat animals and plants so the C14 transfers to us. This means you and I are a little radioactive from the radiocarbon inside us. After we die, we obviously no longer eat, so the C14 begins to decay back into nitrogen 14, where it started.** 

**If we want to know the age of when something died, we bring it to a multi million dollar machine called the accelerator mass spectrometre, so we can backtrack the decay to the original amount of C14 that was in the subject before it died. Since we rely on unprovable assumptions such as determining the unknown amount of carbon 14 that was in the subject before it died, we get answers that are hundreds of years to tens of thousands of years off from the true age. We have real examples of this flaw in action by attempting to date known age material which resulted in an age that was far off from the real age.** 

**Fortunately we can agree on one thing. C14 should completely decay back to nitrogen in any plant or animal after a period of 95,000 years after the subject has died, so anything with observable carbon still in it shows that the subject is less than 95,000 years old. However, an eight-year project known as the RATE project which operated from 1997 to 2005 sought out to prove if radiocarbon and radiometric dating were accurate methods to determine the age of dead organisms or rocks. During this research project they were sent ten samples of coal from different layers in the Earth’s crust from different states from the United States department of energy. The RATE project sent the coal samples to a laboratory with the accelerator mass spectrometre and then analyzed the results. The coal came from far underground in areas that seculars consider to be anywhere from 50 million to 300 million years old, so the RATE project was hit with surprise when the coal samples returned with carbon 14 ages, which should not have been possible if the coal was over 95,000 years old. The ages given for each of the samples were relatively similar, which means all these samples came from coal beds that formed during the same time, under 95,000 years ago! This has been considered hard hitting evidence against the coal being millions of years old.** 

**However, there is a popular claim that the coal took hundreds of millions of years to form, so the results given by the laboratory was considered to be contaminated, even though there is no proof that any of these were ever contaminated. So how did all of this coal form so quickly under 95,000 years? Turns out, we have known the solution since the 1980s. Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois in 1983 first discovered that coal took less severe circumstances than originally thought to form after they made a type of artificial coal from naturally occurring materials. In 1985 they were able to make coal completely indistinguishable from natural coal in the ground under a single year by once again, only using naturally occurring material that would have the same effect on the coal found in the ground today. So we have evidence that the coal is under 95,000 years old and can be formed under a single year. This completely disrupts the notion that the geological column is hundreds of millions of years old.** 

**The final piece of this puzzle would be why is the coal beneath us in the first place? We know that the coal is young so must have formed rapidly, what could have caused it? We have an answer from actual eyewitness testimony. Around the world there are over 200 accounts from over 200 cultures that describe that there was once a world of long-living people that were wiped out with a catastrophic flood by divine power. For example, the Hawaiian flood legend says that a man named Nu-u built a large boat to save his family from a flood. His boat eventually landed safely on the mountain called Mount Kea, in which afterwards he sacrificed pigs and coconuts to the moon. In the flood legend, this creator descended from a rainbow to reveal himself as the one who saved mankind.**

**Based on successful scientific probabilities and the historically accurate events given afterwards, the flood account from the Biblical book of Genesis is considered the true account, especially when compared to the obvious fallibility of some of the coexisting records, such as the Akkadian flood legend, in which the boat dimensions described would kill everything inside during a worldwide flood.**

**In the flood account given in Genesis, a place called the “Fountains of the Great Deep” were broken up by God, which resulted in igniting the Great Flood which occurred afterward, as scientific consensus of Creation Scientists have concluded that the “Fountains of the Great Deep” are actually the fault lines. A rapid breaking up of these lines would result in massive continental shifting that would cause countless tidal waves and tsunamis to destroy and kill anything that was not on the divinely protected Ark, which carried the family and animals that were spared by The God who sent the flood. The synchronized reshaping of the Earth and destruction of countless forests and jungles on the Antediluvian planet resulted in the now destroyed plant life to be crushed under the sediments laid down after the deluge. The chronology given to date this event was roughly four and a half thousand years ago. This eyewitness testimony gives a clear indication unto why the coal carbon dates to only be a few thousand years old and why the coal is there in the first place.** 

**There is no reason to suggest that the Earth and the geologic column resulted after millions of years of age. This is because we have observed carbon 14 dates of a recent death, observable and testable science that coal can be formed rapidly under a single year, and on top of that, supported by an eyewitness account concludes that the coal in the geologic column of the Earth is a recent formation.**

Creation,eqfw6i,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Theistic Evolution: Science or Heresy?,"It is my observation that theistic evolution is the most common belief in America,  and i suspect, most of western civilization. It is an attempt to blend, or hybridize, the pop belief of abiogenesis and common ancestry,  with the inner, felt sense of a universe with a Higher Power.

But it only mixes bad science with bad theology, to arrive at a flawed view of reality.

There are many things you can conclude, if you assume God used abiogenesis and common ancestry to bring man into being:

**Theological**  
1. Man was not created as a complete being, with a soul. 
2. Death and suffering were the means God used, to 'create' man.  
3. Mankind is not equal, as there would be different levels of advancement among the evolving human tribes.  
4. The biblical account of man's creation and subsequent fall, bringing death into the world, is false.  
5. Morality is relative.. as man evolved, so did his instincts about morals. Early man could have brutal animal instincts, but they might change.  
6. God is fickle and changing.. there are no absolutes.  

**Social**
1. The more highly evolved, among the human collective, should manage and control the lower forms.  
2. Aspiring to evolve the Perfect Man is a logical step, in the evolution of man.  
3. Eliminating inferior stock is a necessary step, in any selective breeding process.  

*Scriptural conflicts with theistic evolution*: 

Acts17:24“The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; 26and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, 27that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; 28for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we also are His children.’

John1:1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not [a]comprehend it.

Genesis1:1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

Acts4:18So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. 20For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” 21So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done. 22For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed. 23And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. 24So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: **“Lord, You are God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them**..

Deut32:6Is this the way you repay the Lord,
you foolish and unwise people?
Is he not your Father, your Creator,
who made you and formed you?

Rom1:25They exchanged God’s truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator

Other logical problems with theistic evolution:  

1. If you premise an All Powerful Being, able to create a universe from nothing, why limit Him to naturalistic processes, that cannot even be established as valid scientific mechanisms?   Neither abiogenesis nor common descent has any scientific evidence.  They are conflicting RELIGIOUS beliefs, that have their root in atheistic naturalism. 

2. Attempting to 'spiritualize' the biblical creation account just emasculates it, as a historical event.   Dream and allegory render any biblical or historical event as meaningless and illusory. 

3. The prophets and biblical writers bore false witness, and were liars, relaying events that did not happen. 

Theistic evolution is a lame, irrational attempt to blend State sponsored Indoctrination of atheistic naturalism,  to the inner sense of God.  It tries to hybridize bad science with bad theology, and arrives at a useless, corrupt view of both.  It denies the Ability of God, and ignores the deception and duplicity of man.  It is a deadly poison, that leads people away from their Creator,  to a man made delusion.

Creation,eqfcup,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Speciation,"The primary condition for speciation is reproductive isolation. That is the main 'definition' of a species, that they do not reproduce with other different species. The horse has a genetic link to other horse descendants. These all indicate a narrowing of the genetic material.. a 'devolution' if you will. A donkey came from the same parent species as the horse &amp; zebra, but they are not able to reproduce viable offspring.. they CAN reproduce, but the progeny is sterile.. like the mule. But instead of this indicating an EXPANSION of trait availability, the facts are the exact opposite. It was a narrowing of the gene pool that isolated the horse, donkey, &amp; zebra. All of those animals descended from the same parent species.. we can trace that. But instead of opening up new traits of variability, they lost them. The zebra traits don't come up in donkeys anymore. And new 'species' are not being produced. What we see with the horse genetic line is a branching into a dead end. The variability is lost, as the progeny do not have the variety to pick from in their parent's dna.

You can explain the tree branches somewhat with descent. But you still don't have the mechanism that enables the leaps between the family/genus/species. As science, the 'amoeba to man' theory is full of holes, yet it is taught as though it is proven fact. The observable, repeatable FACTS are that breeding &amp; natural selection NARROW the genetic availability, until the species reaches equilibrium &amp; loses variability. That is why a brown rabbit is seldom (never?) born in the snowshoe rabbit species anymore. It is why chihuahuas do not produce an occasional wolf. That variability is lost, &amp; the breed is limited to the narrow band of variability. The very science of breeding is contrary to the premise of evolution: that new genetic material is constantly being produced &amp; increasing the complexity &amp; variability within a species. We observe the exact opposite. We repeat the exact opposite.

Even if some 'new' trait is discovered while breeding, now we know it was there.. hiding in the massive dna strands. It might take thousands or millions of generations for it to pop up, but when it does, this did not mean a new trait made itself, just that the hidden gene took a while to hit the jackpot. It is like pulling on a slot machine in vegas.. if you pull it enough times, eventually the sequence will come up that hits the combination you want. That is all breeding &amp; natural selection is, except they get to narrow the variability &amp; reduce the 'losing' combinations. Slot machines don't let you do that.

Why do species go extinct? Because they lose the variability needed to adapt to the changing environment. They don't create genes to survive if conditions change. If there is some variability already in them that increases their survival rate, then that trait will become more prominent. But if they don't have that trait, they die off. That is observable reality, not that species create new genetic information to adapt.

Modern genetics is one of the biggest enemies of the old 'theory' of evolution. Eventually, the facts will overwhelm the beliefs, &amp; the scientific establishment will come up with a new pop theory of origins. But they still are working this one for now. It is everywhere.. tv, national parks, museums, schools.. anywhere science is mentioned, evolution is tacked on, to prop it up as a belief. But real science does not support the theory. All of reality screams, 'NO!'

I'm sure there is more.  Individually,  each might be dismissed as an anomaly of human peculiarity.   But combined, they present a compelling conclusion of a Creator, for our origins and existence. 

So the next time you hear, '*There is no evidence for a Creator!!*', realize that is bluff and denial, not objective analysis of reality.",1,1579258097,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/epytun/evidence_for_the_creator_summary/
Creation,epyn45,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Philosophy of Origins,"I see 2 basic options for Origins:

*1. All matter &amp; life was created by an unknown being or beings: Intelligent Design.*  

*2. All matter &amp; life happened by accident, via unknown natural processes: Atheistic Naturalism.*  

Intelligent design includes creationism, alien seeding, &amp; any other theories that require the outside involvement of an intelligent being or beings. Atheistic Naturalism says that life started by natural processes, &amp; has evolved by other natural processes to the state we observe today., *without* a Creator.

Now, there are hybrid theories that combine the two. Some believe that intelligent design 'started' the process, &amp; natural processes have evolved life to where it is today. But there are still basically these 2 possibilities of our origins. And if you could prove the naturalistic view, there would be no need for any supernatural explanation, as the naturalistic one would suffice. And of course the flip side would also be true. If you could prove the existence of a being or beings who have the power to create a universe, any natural explanations would only be the methods they used.

We try to use science &amp; logic to decide which of these is the more likely, or what the evidence suggests, but nothing really works. Science cannot answer this. We cannot see or define any natural process that could have done it, so we are left ONLY with belief in either theory. Neither are subject to the scientific method.. they can't be repeated or observed. But neither has any provable evidence. Both theories are logically impossible. LIFE is impossible. The entire universe is impossible, yet here we are.

Of all the fundamental questions of life, Origins is the MOST BASIC of the questions, &amp; the answer to this one affects all the others.

IF we are here by atheistic naturalism:

1. There is no purpose to our existence. 'Why' is meaningless.  
2. There are no rules. Morality &amp; law are inventions of our own minds.  
3. There is no destiny. You die &amp; cease to exist. As you were for eternity past, so you will be for eternity future.  

IF we are here by Supernatural Design:

1. There might be a purpose. Why would such a Being do this?  
2. There might be rules, from the Creator's perspective. Perhaps there are consequences to our words &amp; deeds.  
3. There might be life after death. We may have souls, &amp; live beyond what we see here.  

As you can see, there are completely different answers to fundamental questions, depending on the answer to the very first one: *How?*  Wise men &amp; philosophers have spent millennia grappling with the possibilities, but humanity is at no more of a consensus than when we started.

That is why a person's view of Origins is the foundation upon which their entire world view is built upon. Most people are content to have a disjointed, hodge podge of irrational thought, faulty assumptions, and wrong answers to base their philosophy of life upon. But that is because the MOST BASIC QUESTION, our origins, is unknown by any of our natural senses. There are other factors: mental, emotional, or spiritual..  that are not part of our natural sensory perceptions that figure in. But from a scientific point of view, those are not subject to scientific scrutiny, &amp; do not count as empirical evidence.

There is no empirical answer to our origins. There are no natural laws, or scientific explanations that can even make a decent guess as to HOW we came about. We are here. But HOW we came about remains a mystery, unanswerable by human reason &amp; senses. If there is an answer to this question, reason &amp; science cannot answer it.  We can only fit the evidence into plausible models, to see if it works, logically. 

Unfortunately, the beliefs about origins are not clearly seen by many. Some believe that evolution &amp; natural processes are proven fact, &amp; that the naturalist theory is scientifically 'settled'. They will zealously &amp; dogmatically assert evolution as '*proven scientific fact!', when it is not even a good theory. Most of our public institutions support this unscientific concept, &amp; evolution is taught as fact in schools, national parks, nature shows, &amp; practically all human institutions. It is the status quo of origins, but like others before, it should be scrutinized &amp; submit to the scientific method.  Critical thinking,  skepticism, and Questioning Authority are the best tools for discovery.",0,1579256722,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/epyn45/philosophy_of_origins/

I have a bit of a different take, but this is actually the same method i used to grasp a better understanding of god. However you don't start with the qualities about the creator. First you must set up what the observations we have of the world in general mean pertaining to such an idea.

1. **All things in nature are complex**, highly ordered, and generally beautiful. The universe carries set laws of nature, mathematics, logic, etc.

2. **The world is running down**, falling apart, degrading, corrupted, full of evil. And also from a more modern perspective generally building up towards some grand historical event, maybe a world war, which may end up ending all of humanity. 

3. **All men are inherently flawed**, yet have an innate sense of moral law we use to judge good and evil which carries even to the most secluded peoples.

4. **All living things die**, and there is a unique difference between a living and dead body not only relating to bodily functions.

5. **Another kind of reality exists.** Every culture that has ever existed has carried stories of supernatural, otherworldly, and the mystical to an extent that at least some of it must be based in reality. Dreams are another kind of alternate reality.

6. **Belief is powerful**, a driving force throughout history, and motivation and depression, medical shock, charismatic leaders and placebo effects testify to this

7. **Relationships are important and necessary**, not only between living things but all of creation relies in some part on another, from animal and human ecosystems, star and planet formations, chemical bonds; nothing is ever still and nothing is ever alone.

8. **Humans are special beyond all of creation**, with language, sentient consciousness, technology, philosophy, etc.

9. **There are limits to everything in existence**, and trying to go past the limits we have in place will only hurt us, whether it be excessive eating, excessive lying, etc.

10. **All things come from something of higher complexity**. You can't get something from nothing.

Just from these 10 principles, you can understand God as Christianity does.  
From all of this, you can first understand that we come from something more complex than ourselves, which since we are limited in nature must go past that, and is supernatural in nature. This kind of ""Creator-force"" as you can call it at this state, if it is unlimited and supernatural, must be outside of the universe. 
This creator force just by making us, especially since we are clearly above creation, has a kind of relationship with us, and since this creator is unlimited, so are all of its qualities. An infinite relationship means infinite love, goodness, truth, justice, and all of the traditional concepts of god. This creator force, being infinite, cannot be divided or immuted, and mustn't carry an infinitely regressing chain of creators. There is but one, and thus God is the better term at this state of thinking.

Now, if this idea of god were to just have love, goodness, truth, etc. as external and created concepts, this would mean that he didn't have them before the universe, meaning he wouldn't have made us in the first place. So what this means is that God must be the very concept, essence, and being of love, truth, and goodness. Every time love or truth is present, it is a reflection of god, which is another way of saying we are in his image.  

Since there is an objective moral law we all understand, there must be punishment for that law. But as God is the essence of Good, then God doesn't seem to just be writing a law to judge us with, but rather he *is* the law. We are not judged in the sense of a courtroom, but rather we are judged in whether we choose to adhere to god or not - he dwells in our hearts and we can choose to set up the temple for him or not. As God is pure love, truth, and goodness, then that would mean that where he is not is hate, lies, and evil. Essentially, the obverse of god is hell. So this means that people are not tortured by a judge, jury, and executioner god, but rather we choose to alienate the thing which is pure love and happiness and in doing so he lovingly lets us go to the one place where by definition he is not - hell. We doom ourselves in selfish pride.

Now knowing all things will die, this seems to be a dividing line between now and the next reality. Belief and relationships carry an importance and power that extends beyond, since god as infinite relationship and love is living within us, we can use faith and love of our own making in order to open ourselves more to him. In a sense, by imitating god, we can become ""gods"" of our own, somewhat like a father and son relationship. We are able to grasp the infinite even from our finite place. In this, we can realize that, especially just to create us, God must have knowledge, thought, and being, and thus all of these infinite. More than love, God is *life*.

Now thinking back, if God is the essence of love, whom did he love before anything was ever made? And if God is outside of creation how can he be within us? The answer now becomes one that goes beyond this kind of logic, as we must look to the gospel which explains it. Before creating anything, god was able to love because he was of trinitarian nature, and he lives within us because he is at once outside of creation, and yet everywhere and fillest all things. Now we know god is all loving, all knowing, and the essence of life itself, and yet all men die. God is all good, yet men and the world are corrupted in evil. We are limited in nature, and unable to fix ourselves, and so must rely on god for everything - He is the life we live, the love we have, the air we breathe. But that is not even enough, and so in Jesus Christ men no longer die, and no longer must be addicted and entangled in evil. Jesus not only fulfills these aspects of God, but fixes the paradox of a divinely ruling God, and yet since he is good, a humble God. 

Many ""paradoxes"" exist of god which are really just misunderstandings. Two of these are fate v.s. free will, and Good works v.s. Faith. If God is sovereign, then we are fated to heaven or hell, and yet this becomes robotic. If we are only able to choose whether to accept Gods love, then it diminishes Gods role. The answer is that we work together with God as two wills become one, like a fork in the road with a guide telling us which path to the village, we could still always go the other way and become lost. But if we trust the guide we were not forced and yet did not do so entirely of our own will. Now Good works are said to be like filthy rags in Gods eyes, and not even the devil is saved by faith, yet both of these are said to save us. There is yet a balance inbetween, which is love. These two paradoxes have especially confused many christians, but it does not disprove at all the notion of God, for every supposed paradox is just a testament to the infinite complexity which God is.

Creation,empetb,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,What is The Creator Like?,"Inspired by the Blind Men and the Elephant poem that i referred to yesterday, i thought a thread where we relate OUR perceptions of The Creator might be of interest.

This is a PERCEPTUAL and scientific examination, not a query for religious dogma.  We observe the material world.  We interact with it.  What can we conclude about the Creator from these observations?

This is a logical companion to belief in creationism. We see the physical evidence,  and conclude, 'Creator!'  So what does the physical evidence tell us about this Creator?

I'll start.

1. The Creator is hidden and mysterious.  We are unable to perceive God with our physical senses. He is obscured from us for some reason, and even our spiritual perceptors seem fuzzy or broken  altogether.  We see the evidence of His Existence,  and the results of His creative power, but we cannot see Him.

2. The Creator is infinite. To create an infinite universe, The Creator would have to be infinite, Himself.

Independent of the Bible, the physical evidence we have in hand combined with accepted laws of physics and chemistry strongly suggests the Fossil Record is much younger than millions of years old.  However, based on accepted science and data we do not yet have a convincing empirical and theoretical case that universe is young.  There are serious anomalies with the Big Bang, so much so that variable speed of light theories have become fashionable!  The mainstream will invoke variable speed of light to save a failing theory (like the Big Bang), but then they'll claim variable speed of light is crank science if YEC/YCC (Young Cosmos Creationists) invoke variable speed of light.  Ah, the hypocrisy!  Nevertheless, I wouldn't say we have a slam dunk case in terms of evidence outside the Bible that the universe is young.

Anyway, I teach Creationism and Apologetics in a mega church where there are YECs, OECs, and Theistic Darwinists.  I don't think Christian brothers who are members should be expelled or treated as if they were wife-beaters or heretics for having a different view of Genesis.  That is also the church policy, and the most senior pastors of the church have historically been YECs.

We could totally avoid discussion the issue in church, which I think would be worse than not talking about it all!  Having a discussion, a debate, even a public disagreement is far better than pretending there aren't sharp disagreements over the issue of origins.  I'd rather have non-unity over the issue in the church and have open and visible debates and discussion where the youth can hear all sides of the case, rather than letting the youth hear ONLY the Darwinist or Old Earth side when they go to university.

With that said, I'd like to thank Marek and Cody for a civil discussion about viewpoints which we have strong disagreement over.  As I do in my church, if someone professes Jesus as Lord and Savior, I treat them as brothers.

Creation,embdx1,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,"The Blind Men and the Elephant, revisited","*THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT*
John Godfrey Saxe

IT was six men of Indostan. 
To learning much inclined,  
Who went to see the Elephant. 
(Though all of them were blind),  
That each by observation. 
Might satisfy his mind.  

The First approached the Elephant,  
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me!—but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried: ""Ho!—what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 't is mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out his eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'T is clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: ""E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!

So, oft in theologic wars
The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
Not one of them has seen!

This is a wonderful poem, imo, that only needs a slight update for the modern religious climate.

There were actually 7 blind men, not 6. His perceptions were left out, by Mr. Saxe, but that was just a cultural oversight, i am sure. I will add the 7th man, to make the poem more contemporary and relevant.

*The last, extending empty hands, 
Disdainfully, he hissed,  
'You fools!', said he, 'it's obvious,  
Your brains are in a twist!

Creation,em8vr5,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Personal Experience,"Millions of people, over the millennia,  have claimed some kind of metaphysical experience or contact with a spiritual dimension. Many call this 'God', with dogmatic assurance.

Due to the perceptive abilities of humans, and their propensity for MISperception, these descriptions and/or experiences do not always align.  But 'something' or 'Someone', happened to these people.  There are too many instances,  over thousands of years,  spanning all regions, cultures, and race, to dismiss all of them as 'wishful thinking', or delusion.

The old Hindu parable, about the blind men and the elephant is a word picture of human (mis!)perceptions.

But let us examine the arguments that wishful thinking, delusion, or fear are the 'real reasons!' that people believe in The Creator. 

**Belief in The Creator:**  

*Wishful Thinking*  
This life can be hard.  No argument there. Some, wishing to avoid the emptiness, difficulty, and purposelessness of their existence might fabricate an afterlife, where the streets are paved with gold, and where milk and honey flows freely.  

*Delusion* 
Human beings are manipulators.  Some find pleasure and/or monetary gain by manipulating others with fantastic tales. Fearful, lost, confused, and bewildered people are easily taken in by the smooth talking manipulations of these charlatans.  

*Fear*  
Unable to cope with the reality of a purely material universe,  with no purpose or meaning, some (most?) people are driven by fear to believe in a Creator and an afterlife.  

These are common arguments why people choose to believe in God, and any personal evidence/experience is dismissed as a delusion. But if these are valid arguments as to 'why?' people believe 'IN GOD', can they not also be be reasons to believe IN atheistic naturalism? 

**Belief in godless naturalism:**  

*Wishful Thinking*  
Unwilling to face the prospect of accountability to their Creator, and the possibility of an afterlife and/or soul, some people fabricate a godless universe,  where there are no consequences to our thoughts,  words, or actions.  

*Delusion*  
These same human manipulators can deceive with an ideological agenda of godless naturalism,  for the same control/monetary gain motivations.

*Fear*  
Terrified of the prospect of an omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipresent Creator, and the possibility of consequences for our thoughts, words, and actions, humans concoct fantastic imaginations to escape the dread and angst that broods in their innermost being.  Atheistic naturalism is one such fantasy.

So any arguments as to why a person might believe in The Creator can apply to belief in atheistic naturalism as well..  perhaps more so.  Many of the believers in God have claimed a personal experience with the supernatural.. something that believers in atheistic naturalism cannot claim.  They have personal skepticism and dismissal of other's experiences ONLY. 

The obvious, observable reality that millions of people, over thousands of years, have claimed to experience 'something' supernatural, is evidence for that reality.  Taken together with all the other evidence, a conclusion of a Creator is compelling..  overwhelming, really.",5,1578572433,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/em8vr5/evidence_for_the_creator_personal_experience/

The stats 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22572/
Kinesin hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of approximately 80 molecules per second. Thus, given the step size of 80 Å per molecule of ATP, kinesin moves along a microtubule at a speed of 6400 Å per second. This rate is considerably slower than the maximum rate for myosin, which moves relative to actin at 80,000 Å per second. Recall, however, that myosin movement depends on the independent action of hundreds of different head domains working along the same actin filament, whereas the movement of kinesin is driven by the processive action of kinesin head groups working in pairs. Muscle myosin operates to maximize the speed of the motion, whereas kinesin functions to achieve steady, but slower, transport in one direction along a filament.""

Myosin

These data suggest that kinesin has an organization very similar to that of myosin even though there are no obvious sequence similarities between the two molecules.

""Kinesin and Myosin are motor proteins. Motor proteins are molecular motors that move on the surface of a suitable substrate. The image can be likened to a train moving over a railway track except that Kinesin and Myosin are two different trains requiring two different types of tracks. The movement of these motor molecules is powered by the breakdown of the universal energy molecule called as ATP.

It was noted by the author of the first paper that there were blatantly obvious similarities between the two systems of transportation,  even though there were no sequence suggestive similarities..

The prevailing trend in current models of early eukaryotic cell evolution is the proposal of stepwise acquisition of cellular complexity with particular extant eukaryotic lineages being identified as derived from intermediary and primitive phases of early eukaryotic evolution (reviewed in [1]). This idea is contradicted by the results presented here, which demonstrate that, at least for the kinesin-driven cytoskeleton, the LCEA 
(The mythical Last Universal Eukaryotic Ancestor)
already possessed a highly complex cellular form before giving rise to any of the sampled extant eukaryotic groups. This proto-eukaryotic cell was surprisingly highly developed in terms of kinesin motor types - containing the majority of families now found in eukaryotes.""

""the history of kinesins is in many cases a history of paralog loss from an ancestral form which possessed a motor repertoire more complex than many extant organisms.""

Creation,elspqh,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,The apostle Paul disavows death before sin (Old earth Christian views refuted simply),"One of the central tenets of old-earth Christian theists (progressive creationists &amp; theistic evolutionists) is the belief that when the Bible teaches that ""the wages of sin is death"", it is referring **only** to spiritual death, not physical death. People holding these views must interpret all references to death being the result of sin in this fashion: spiritual, not physical. They must hold that physical death is an integral and original part of God's creation.  


Nobody in the church, as far as I know, held to this view prior to the modern era when old earth views became prevalent in secular academic circles. In this way, it looks very much as if it were a reactionary response to these ideas ( a compromise ), rather than anything organic that flows from the natural interpretation of Scripture itself. **This alone is not sufficient to refute the idea**, but it certainly is a giant red flag. One would think that God would empower the church, filled with the Holy Spirit, to rightly interpret His word in this fundamental area without the help of scoffers from outside the church like Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, et al. One would not expect such a drastic reversal in doctrine to come about only thousands of years later, if indeed this is what the Bible has taught all along!  


But we need not rely exclusively on such a weak inductive argument, because the Bible outright refutes the idea that spiritual death is what is referred to when Adam sinned. How do we know?   


The apostle Paul outright states in Romans 8:10:  


"" But if Christ is in you, **although the body is dead because of sin**, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. ""  


All throughout the book of Romans Paul explains in various ways that death is a result of sin. In an earlier place, Paul wrote:  


"" Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned— ""  


Old earthers try to explain this away by saying that this refers only to spiritual ""death"" (separation from God), not to the death of the body. But if that's the case, why did Christ need to come and die physically? It makes no sense. The whole reason Christ came was to ""fulfill the righteous requirement of the Law"". The Bible says ""the wages of sin is death"". If that refers to spiritual death only, then Jesus Christ died for no reason on the physical Cross.  


But Paul makes it clear beyond all question in Romans 8:10. The BODY IS DEAD BECAUSE OF SIN. Old Earth Christians: adjust your views to be in line with clear Biblical teaching.

Creation,elrqwy,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Extinction,"Extinction is evidence of The Creator.

The wide diversity within each family/type/clade/kind reflects the parent stock being full, and then slowly losing diversity, via genomic entropy. 

Felidae,  for example, HAD much more diversity in the past, and the big cats are dwindling and going extinct, not increasing in diversity and traits, like common ancestry predicts.

https://m.ranker.com/list/list-of-extinct-big-cats/ranker-science

*One of the biggest concerns conservationists have these days is the ever-decreasing population of big cats across the planet. Their concerns are certainly warranted as a large number of big cats have gone extinct since the animals first began appearing some two million years ago. While most people are familiar with the likes of the famed sabre-toothed cats, there are recent examples of tigers, the Barbary lion, and other familiar animals that have disappeared in the 20th century.

Starting with the most recently extinct animals, this list of extinct big cats includes many that went extinct thousands of years ago, but there are a few examples of animals that disappeared in the 1900s. Protecting the remaining lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, and others is imperative if we want to keep lists like this one of extinct cats as short as possible.*

**Observation:**

The variability within the felidae family has decreased, and there are fewer traits in that family than in times past.  Many cat varieties have gone extinct, in the last 200 years, and more before that.

**Prediction of Models:**

*Creationism:*  
The ancestral felid contained all the variability, from current and extinct cats. Over time, traits can be lost, as isolation and adaptation 'selects' the winners and losers.

*Common Ancestry:*  
The ancestral felid would be simpler, with fewer traits, and would have increased in complexity and variability over time.

The prediction of increasing complexity, added traits, and wider diversity is not observed.  There is no mechanism to do this and it has never been observed.  It is a belief that scientific observation does not support.

There was MORE diversity in times past, than now.  Felidae is DEVOLVING, not adding traits and increasing in complexity. We observe genetic entropy and extinction, for organisms that do not have the traits to adapt to environmental conditions. 

The observable reality of MORE diversity in the various families, devolving over time..  at times to extinction..  is evidence of a creation event, and conflicts with the belief in common ancestry.",5,1578484470,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/elrqwy/evidence_for_the_creator_extinction/
Creation,elkf9b,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Two logical issues with evolution ...,"_Here are two things that I just thought about vis-a-vis evolution.  In the past I'd post in /debateevolution, but I find it overly hostile , so now I post  there less and  here more._

First, in terms of evolution and adaptation, I don't see how evolution can create **stable complex ecosystems.** Consider the interactions between zebra, impala, lion (assuming that the lion likes to eat the other two). There is a huge environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion. Now we've all seen evolution do amazing things, like evolve hearts and lungs, so making an impala be fast enough (or skillful enough) to avoid capture should not be too hard. Now the lion can also evolve. It loves to eat zebra which are not particularly fast. Again, it wouldn't take much, compared to the convergent evolution of echolocation, for evolution to make the lion slightly better at catching zebra. So the lions then eats all the zebra. All zebra are now gone. It can't catch the implala so then it starves. All lion are now gone. All we have are impala.  The point of this is that it's very easy for minor changes to disrupt complex ecosystems and result in very simple ones. Evolution would tend to create simple ecosystems, not the complex ones that we see now. They are more likely to be created by an intelligence that works out everything to be in balance - with a number of negative feedback stabilization loops too.

Secondly, this [post] led me to consider DNA's error checking and repair mechanisms. How is it, that evolution which depends on random mutations, would evolve mechanisms that try to prevent any mutations from occuring at all? The theory of evolution cannot exist without mutations driving change, so why and how would random mutations end up creating complex nanomachines that try to eliminate all mutations. This doesn't make sense to me.

Creation,ela3xw,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Ideological consequences of Origins Belief,"I have been criticised (on reddit? Say it ain't so!), for examining the *consequential, ideological* implication for belief in common ancestry.  I will provide my reasons for examining the historical, ideological, and political *consequences* for belief in origins, and show how it is NOT a tangential, off topic deflection, but is foundational to other beliefs and conclusions that affect all of humanity. 

Origins is the spearhead, that drives and compels subsequent beliefs. 

If the moderators think those kinds of analyses are inappropriate here, i will honor their decision.

1. Beliefs/ideology do not appear in a vacuum. There are streams of thought that can be traced, in the human experience,  that reveal the sources and implications of foundational beliefs. 
2. Origins is THE FOUNDATIONAL BELIEF for almost everything else.  It reflects a core opinion about the nature of the universe.  **Morality, equality, natural Law**, and other critical beliefs that affect the human animal DIRECTLY, find their basis in the belief in origins. 
3. Interrelated, correlated ideological beliefs can be parsed for individual examination,  but the correlations can also be analyzed for their consequence and significance to human ideology AND their implications. 
4. To pretend origins is just about a dry scientific theory is to miss the ideological war that has been raging for millennia. Darwinism is just a recent (in the timeline of human history) expression of that battle for the soul.

One example, then i will abide by the mod's decision.

**Joseph Stalin** was one of the most significant historical figures in the 20th century. He was instrumental in defeating Hitler, and expanded the influence of communism in his time. Here are some facts about Joseph Stalin:
1. He began as a student in a theological seminary.
2. He became an atheist after reading Origin of Species, by Darwin.
3. He became a devoted communist, and was inspired by Marx.
4. He was responsible for 20 - 25 million deaths, during his reign.
5. He engaged in armed robbery, to support the Bolshevik cause.
6. He impregnated a 13 yr old girl, while exiled in Siberia, c. 1914.

It is impossible to ignore the connection between Stalin's actions, and the core ideology that drove him. Much of the genocide that drove Stalin was to help 'create' the New Soviet Man.. a highly evolved superhuman, much like Hitler's goal for the Aryan nation.

In 1940, a book was published in Moscow entitled “Landmarks in the Life of Stalin.” In it we read:

'*At a very early age, while still a pupil in the ecclesiastical school, Comrade Stalin developed a critical mind and revolutionary sentiments. He began to read Darwin and became an atheist.  G. Glurdjidze, a boyhood friend of Stalin’s, relates:  
“I began to speak of God. Joseph heard me out, and after a moment’s silence, said:  
“‘You know, they are fooling us, there is no God. …’“

I was astonished at these words. I had never heard anything like it before.“‘How can you say such things, Soso?’ I exclaimed.

“‘I’ll lend you a book to read; it will show you that the world and all living things are quite different from what you imagine, and all this talk about God is sheer nonsense,’ Joseph said.

“‘What book is that?’ I enquired.

“‘Darwin. You must read it,’ Joseph impressed on me.”

Another quote, from a contemporary Russian:
Seventy years ago communists easily (and, as it turned out, for a long time) seized power in Russia. Without hesitation they undertook to build a new society, hitherto unprecedented in the history of mankind, and announced the construction of Communism throughout the whole world to be their final goal.
In this society there was to be no private property, it was to be a-religious: denying God, denying the existence of the immortal soul and recognizing only the material aspect of life as real. The society was to be free of ethnic affiliations, and communists were to have unlimited power over that society.
Unprecedented methods were used to build this unprecedented society. It was decided to create a new man. This man was to be free from ethnic affiliations, see no sense in private property, be always ready to sacrifice himself for the benefit of society, have no doubts that he originated from an ape or something like it (certainly from a beast) and that nothing will remain of him after his death. In other words, he was to be a one-hundred percent materialist and atheist and must know that the meaning of life is in the person's usefulness to society and the supreme goal is in a better, wealthy and happy life of future generations. Recognizing this, he would necessarily be happy.
It was obvious to initiators of the new society and creators of the new man that several existing classes of people would delay the implementation of this task. So, it was decided to destroy millions of these people ""as a class ,"" i.e., to kill them. To ""destroy as a class"" is not just a reckless cynical phrase; in fact, it is a guide to practical action. This was done in Russia, and in this way began construction of the new society in every country as soon as the communists seized power*. ~Sergei Khodorovich, 1987

The New Man, as a goal of the controlling elite, is widely referenced in the writings of the Marx/Darwin based ideologies.  Most of the notable despots in the 20th century were driven to help evolution create a New Man. Pol pot, Mao, Chavez, Stalin, Hitler, and almost all Marxist based ideologies included the Darwinist theme of favoring desired traits, and breeding.. helping evolution.. breed a New Man.

Maybe the consequences of that ideology did not affect some, but it did affect millions of others.  It would be naive to think that amoral naturalism has no consequence or influence on the socio/political sphere of the human experience.   On the contrary,  it is the foundation for those influences .",4,1578394879,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ela3xw/ideological_consequences_of_origins_belief/

**Though Experiments:**

Suppose that God does not exist, and you know that God does not exist.  Given the evidence in biology, geology, etc. is all the same, would you conclude that barimonolgy, universal common descent, or a third option is the best account of evolutionary relationships?

Suppose that you have a strong belief that God does not exist, regardless of the fact-of-the-matter.  Would you conclude that barimonolgy, universal common descent, or a third option is the best account of evolutionary relationships?  If a third option, is barimonology or universal common descent more likely just comparing those two?  

Suppose that you suspend judgement on the existence of God, and will suspend judgement regardless of your prefered phylogeny.

So far the findings have been unusual - all the major sites I have looked at are a mixture of continental, freshwater and marine life.  This is unusual because I expected to find this only with fossils from near the Cretaceous Tertiary boundary (ie the point close to the part where dinosaurs died out) however, they seem to be everywhere in all fossil sites. 

The biggest problem I've run into was citation.  Wikipeida has a listing of all the fossils that were found in the major fossil sites, but, while Wikipedia is a great starting point for research, I don't think I could get away with using Wikipedia as a source.  Epically when writing something that most people won't want to believe.  Sci-hub has been a lifesaver in this regard - so I guess I'm officially  pirate now.   

I wanted feedback on exactly what information I should include in these papers so far I decided on the following: 

1. Geologic era (all sites are from the cretaceous but recording what part of the cretaceous)
2. Geographic location (to check proximity to the Mexico meteor which is said to have killed the dinosaurs)
3. Freshwater and saltwater fossils found 
4. continental fossils found 

Any tips of other information I should be looking at that would be useful?  

Further what's the best way to organize this information?  I was thinking of creating a database that way it would be easy to have the computer compile everything and quickly analyze the data. I was thinking of python classes, something along the lines of 

```

class fossil_site:
  def __init__(self, name, era, mixed)
    self.name = name
    self.era = era
    self.mixed = Value
    self.water_exist = value 
    self.marine_exist =Value
    self.freshwater_exist = Value
    self.constinental_exist =Value
    self.marine = []
    self.freshwater = []
    self.unkn_water = []
    self.continental = []
  def __bool__(self)
    return self.mixed != 0  
    self.water_exist = != 0  
    self.marine_exist = != 0  
    self.freshwater_exist = != 0  
    self.constinental_exist = != 0  

```

The values would have to include the names and a citation - so I guess it would have to be a list of tuples, which is already getting pretty complicated.  Anyone have any suggestions for an easier way to compile this information in a way that can be easily retrieved and compared?


Also is anyone interested in helping given that looking through 110 fossil sites is going to take a while, if you're interested, le me know and I'll pass along the list of fossil sites and we can work in tandem using GitHub or something",2,1578372824,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/el6l4b/dinosaur_marine_overlap_self_study_request_for/
Creation,el3e7p,onecowstampede,,t2_2wnbytl0,self.Creation,,DNA,"The information 

DNA is a string of four different subunits linked together chemically. Cellular DNA actually exists as two strands that run in opposite directions and then twist together, as if twisting a ladder around a central pole. These four subunits are usually abbreviated by the first letter of their chemical name, so just use A, G, C, and T.
DNA molecules can link together literally millions of these subunits. But in cellular DNA these strings of subunits do not exist in isolation. They are paired together with subunits of the other string, because DNA is double-stranded. An A always pairs with a T and a G always pairs with a C. So if you know the sequence of one strand, you will know the sequence of the other strand.
On top of all that, each “letter” of the code is like a letter of the English alphabet. The English alphabet uses twenty-six letters to make limitless words. A word can be made up of as few as one letter or as many as over a dozen letters. But in the genetic code, these chemical letters A, G, C, and T are grouped into “words” made up of only three letters. These three-letter words are referred to as codons. Sixty-one of the sixty-four possible three-letter codons code for one of the twenty amino acids found in living cells. The other three codons are “stop” messages.
This means that the sequence of the DNA letters determines the amino acid sequence of proteins. The sequence of amino acids in proteins is largely responsible for the three-dimensional shape of the protein, which determines its function in great part. So, encoded in the sequence of DNA molecules are the digital instructions to code for proteins, the workhorses of any cell. 
[The molecular machines functioning on the energy generated by ATP]
We use letters to form words like DNA uses nucleotide subunits to form codons. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid. We use words to compose sentences. The sequence of codons forms a gene, and the sequence of amino acids forms proteins. We use sentences to form paragraphs, which are then grouped into articles or chapters of a book. Groups of genes and other DNA elements form chromosomes. When books and magazines are brought together, we call this a library. When chromosomes are assembled into the nucleus of a cell, we call this a genome.
You could represent the parallels in the following table:
Letters=NucleotidesWords=Codons (amino acids)Sentences=Genes (proteins)Books=ChromosomesLibrary=Genome
What I’m trying to demonstrate is that the genetic code is a language. We use linguistic words to describe what happens to DNA. DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is like a dialect of DNA. The mRNA is then translated into protein, a totally different language.
This is not just a clever use of analogous terms. These linguistic terms accurately describe what is actually happening. The genetic code is an informational code or a language;  in digital form.

But its not just information,  not just code, not  just sequence.

Neat, right?

So what is the supposed evolutionary relationship of the ATPsynthase..
How is this one spun as evidence for common descent?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154653/
""we mapped the distribution of nine bioenergetic modes on a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences from 272 species representing the full diversity of prokaryotic lineages. This highlights the patchy distribution of many pathways across different lineages, and suggests either up to 26 independent origins or 17 horizontal gene transfer events""

I would consider all of those potentials, saltational events. 
(Pronounced mir•a•cle mĭr′ə-kəl)
*ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)
Y'know..Indistinguishable from a thanos finger snap..

But, for the sake of argument,  consider the 17 horizontal gene transfers

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2531898?dopt=Abstract
Note the repeat:
""it was not possible to derive the exact evolutionary relationship among the primary kingdoms..""

They then go on to say that if ( 17 of)  these events did happen ""x"" would be the likely order... assuming common descent as a premise...

But what is horizontal gene transfer? Has it ever been directly observed or is its essence only inferred  to try and justify why identical sequences (identical molecular structures) are found everywhere throughout the domains of life..
Wiki has this to say..

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer_in_evolution

""HGT happens very infrequently – at the individual organism level, it is highly improbable for any such event to take place. However, on the grander scale of evolutionary history, these events occur with some regularity.""

*Facepalm*

 ""On one hand, this forces biologists *to abandon the use of individual genes as good markers for the history of life*. ..
(Italicized Emphasis mine)
On the other hand, this provides an almost unexploited large source of information about the past...""

Wait. Wut???? 
Did we just stumble on the biological equivalent of dark matter? How is it both the evidence for common descent and the nullification of phylogenetic inference? 

Magic thinking, perhaps? Or is the phrase mental gymnastics more apt.. 

I'll stop here,  for now.

Creation,eke27m,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Phony Science!,"Here are a few of the Fake Science Beliefs of the day:  
1. **Global Warming**. This is actually the poster child for Fake Science. It meets all the criteria: agenda driven, ridicule for any critics, ad hominem, contrived data, mandated belief, &amp; relentless indoctrination.  
2. **A woman can do what she pleases with her body**. This ignores the scientific evidence of a unique, individual human being growing inside the woman, which is the mammalian way of reproduction. The new person is no longer 'a part of the woman's body', but a new life, growing inside her. It is fake science to claim it is a 'blob of tissue', or other euphemisms.  
3. **Common Ancestry is settled science, &amp; is proven to be the origin of man!** This is flawed in every way, &amp; is also Fake Science. There is NO evidence that this is even possible, much less that it DID happen. It is merely an indoctrinated belief.  
4. **Guns kill people**! Statistics are given, from juggled data sets, &amp; deceptive studies, to try to demonize the firearm, which is also a great deterrent for evildoers. But only the negatives are presented, to try to promote a false perception, &amp; to promote a phony narrative.  
5. **White people are evil**! The race obsessed, divisive left is constantly revising history, promoting false narratives of 'white privilege,' 'black lives matter', &amp; other hysteria based racist memes. It is not supported by facts or reality, but is a phony narrative, used to instigate violence, sedition, &amp; division in society.  
6. **A nation should have open borders**. This is historically &amp; logistically false &amp; impossible. A nation that has any attraction to immigration must have some kind of orderly system for immigrants. Open borders only create chaos, crime, &amp; overload the system. The reasoning &amp; arguments for it are completely irrational, fallacious, &amp; based on deceptive data.  
7. **Need money?  Print some!** This is the absurd belief that monetary policy should be based on decree, rather than production. But all fiat money does is devalue, as inflation eats up the wealth of the working man, &amp; transfers it to the ruling elite.  
8. **Govt can enable everyone to live off of everybody else**! This is the 'Great Fiction' that Bastiat wrote of, &amp; ignores the more basic problems of production of food &amp; other necessities, which 'govt' cannot produce. Only working people create the necessities of life.  
9. **America is evil**!  :O .. America is the only successful experiment in self rule, in the history of man. Those who hate it as a system usually suggest some kind of marxist, collectivist solution, which has a terrible record for the common man, of rights, opportunity, prosperity, or anything else.  
10. **Choose your Identity!**  This ignores scientific reality. It pretends that biological reality is somehow a choice, or an option you can make at any time in your life. But it ignores the genetic &amp; biological reality of gender, species, age, or traits.  
11. **Love Trumps Hate**. This is a favorite slogan of the progressive left, which they demonstrate by rioting, burning cars, &amp; committing acts of violence on those who disagree with them. It is merely Orwellian 'New speak', which redefines reality with opposite terms.  
12. **Islam is the religion of peace**. This is also demonstrated, almost daily, with suicide bombers, attacks on civilians, &amp; terrorist attacks, with the left constantly defending them while attacking other beliefs as 'bigoted'.  

It is a juggernaut of cultural change, brought on by the progressive religion, with their roots in Marxist and Darwinist principles, and promoted exclusively by the left wing propaganda machine. It is accelerating, and I do not believe that a dwindling, dying breed of traditional Americans, can stop it.

In my lifetime i have witnessed this cultural transformation in many areas:

1. Drugs are cool. Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  
2. Free love. AKA, sexual immorality. Inconsequential sex, for fun, with no repercussions. To enable that, we need:  
3. Abortion on demand. Kill the baby, so you can live the dream of inconsequential sex.  
4. Normalize homosexuality. Like many other values in America, this went from being despised, aberrant behavior to hip and trendy.  
5. Militant greenies. 'Save Mother Earth from the evil capitalists!' ..and to do that:  
6. Socialism is cool! A Marxist, collectivist utopia would solve everything!  

Before I was born, the anti Creator movement was already underway. I was indoctrinated into atheistic naturalism, which is at the core of progressivism. 

**It was the amoral basis of atheistic naturalism that opened the pandora's box for all the other 'transformation!' changes**.

Why, in a nation allegedly dedicated to NON ESTABLISHMENT  of religion, would the institutions of govt dedicate themselves to exclusive Indoctrination of a religio/philosophical belief?

For decades, the courts and legislatures have worked tirelessly to ban any suggestion of a Creator,  and promote EXCLUSIVELY,  the belief in atheistic naturalism. State run schools,  aka, Indoctrination centers, ban any mention of a Creator,  except as fodder for ridicule and mocking.  Only atheistic naturalism,  and their core beliefs, are taught and presented as 'settled science!', until the hapless indoctrinees nod like bobbleheads, and bow in humble obeisance to the decrees of the High Priests of Atheism

*The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions*.  ~Noam Chomsky

A fascinating historical study is the progressive hijacking of the judicial and legislative branches to mandate their agenda, and to censor any opposition.

The teaching of universal common  ancestry is one such example.

At the turn of the 19th century, progressivism was taking off, as an ideological worldview. The theory of universal common descent was an integral part of this worldview, and provided the naturalistic basis needed.

Dewey, Wilson, Sanger, Roosevelt, and many other progressives sought to bring the superstitious, backward nation into the 20th century, where their goal of a collectivist utopia could be realized. Marx and Darwin were constantly referenced, by the early progressives.

But the Christian convictions were strong, in middle America, and they could not get their agenda of exclusive control of religious/philosophical concepts in those areas. The cities and coasts were easy, and progressive ideology became the standard in academia.

Most laws, regarding topics of educational instruction, were minimal.. It was left to locales to set curriculum, and religious instruction was common. Prayers were often offered to God, and biblical themes were commonly taught.

Note the following judicial timeline.  It clearly shows the slow transition from a God centered, traditional American values ideology, into a naturalistic one, where any alternate expressions of philosophical belief are banned. ..under the guise of 'science!'

*1925- the state of Tennessee passes a law banning the teaching of evolution in public school. It went to court, in what has been called the 'Scopes monkey trial'. Many other states followed suit, banning the teaching of evolution. The tennessee law was upheld initially.

1967 – Tennessee repeals the Butler Act, the law that banned the teaching of evolution in public schools.

1968 – In Epperson v. Arkansas, the Supreme Court strikes down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.

1973 – Tennessee passes a law requiring that public schools give equal emphasis to ""the Genesis account in the Bible"" along with other theories about the origins of man.  The 'Equal Time' law.

1975 – Tennessee's ""equal time"" law is declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.

1982 — In McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, a U.S. district judge strikes down an Arkansas law that required public schools to give ""balanced treatment"" to evolution and creationism whenever either was taught.

1987 – In Edwards v. Aguillard, the Supreme Court rules that a Louisiana law requiring public schools to give ""balanced treatment"" to creationism and evolution is unconstitutional.

1990 - In Webster v. New Lenox School District, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that a school district may prohibit a teacher from teaching creation science.

1994, in Peloza v. Capistrano School District, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court finding that a teacher's First Amendment right to free exercise of religion is not violated by a school district's requirement that evolution be taught in biology classes.

2005 - in Selman et al. v. Cobb County School District et al., U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled that a evolution warning label required in Cobb County textbooks violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The disclaimer stickers stated, ""This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully, and critically considered.""*

Notice the dates. In 1925, the pinnacle of the progressive movement, they used the courts to demand an equal voice for teaching origins, &amp; a naturalistic view of the universe. Then, there is a long period of silence from the courts, as the world war raged, &amp; God was appealed to &amp; acknowledged in every aspect of US culture.  Prayers were publicly offered 'for the boys', and the nation had an appearance of deep spirituality and piety.  Less than a decade after WW2,  they put 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. 'In God we trust' was the official motto, put on money, &amp; adopted in 1956, the waning years of this short interruption in progressive domination.

Remember the commie witch hunts? It was a feeble attempt to rid American culture of anti American, destructive influences, &amp; is now hailed by progressives everywhere (who are more sympathetic to the communists, the target of the hunts) as 'hate crime', &amp; bigotry.

But by the 70's, darwinian theory had become dominant, &amp; it now was not content to be given equal footing with a supernatural view of origins &amp; the universe, but demanded a monopoly.. they were to become the ONLY view allowed by the courts, in the state run indoctrination centers, aka public schools.

*WMAP observations also support an add-on to the big bang framework to account for the earliest moments of the universe. Called ""inflation,"" the theory says that the universe underwent a dramatic early period of expansion, growing by more than a trillion trillion-fold in less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. Tiny fluctuations were generated during this expansion that eventually grew to form galaxies.*

So, a period of 'inflation', where the laws of physics were set aside for '*less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second'!*, occured, it is suggested. The entire universe exploded in an instant, filling millions of light years of space, allowing light and other waves continuity, so they can be seen, now, without having to wait billions of years for them to get here.

But by what standard do you arbitrarily assign '13.77 billion years!', as the age of the universe, if you posit an inflation of 'less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a second', to expand it to its current condition? It could have been just millions, or even thousands.. why arbitrarily choose '13.77 billions!', when there is NO WAY of knowing how far back this 'inflation' took place?

*'Tiny fluctuations grew to form galaxies!'*

 Really?  Can you not see the fantastic speculation going on here, dogmatically declared as 'science!'?

And just HOW did this inflation allegedly happen, suspending all known natural laws? Trillions fold expansion in trillionths of a second? The acceleration to do this would vaporize any matter.  And then it stops, suddenly, overcoming all inertia in this imaginary fantasy of godless origins?  This phenomenon cannot be observed, repeated, or any mechanism explained. It is a physical impossibility, yet is glibly declared as 'settled science!', and eager bobbleheads eat it up like candy.

It's presented as solid and proven in the popular press but I'm regularly reading scientists complaining about how there is not enough evidence behind it.

I realize that a lot of people here think dating and eons like the cretaceous are fiction, nevertheless if cretaceous fossils keep turning up mixed with marine fossils, and the impact hypothesis becomes weakened I think that would make a strong scientific case for a global flood wiping out the dinosaurs.

The debate is about Young Earth/Old Earth as a whole, so anything is permitted. My main focus is on geology and archeology, while my opponent is focused on distant starlight.

He already knows about the anisotropic synchrony convention and will attempt to combat it with redshifts. He will also go into other astronomical ways to 'support' the old Earth. Problem here is that i'm not well understood in astronomy/starlight. My opponent is always one step ahead of me.

My request for help is in bullet points:

•What pieces of astronomy support a Young Earth?
•How does redshifts fit with the ASC?
•Where did moon craters come from, if it was not the result of millions of years of astroid hits?

Creation,ej18fv,vivek_david_law,,t2_526vfq87,self.Creation,,Beginnings of life on land: Mysteries of the Ediacaran eden,"### The Ediacaran 

The Ediacaran era was the first era in which we first find multicellular life in the fossil record.  It lasts from about 635 million years ago to 541 million years ago.   Most of our fossil record from the Ediacaran period come from the following sites  the Avalon Peninsula in my homeland of Canada, Nama Basin in Namibia and the Ediacara Hills in australia for which the period is named.

One unique thing about lifeforms of this era is that they didn't have a geographical range like modern creaures.  The various creatures of this age seem to be found all over the world from Africa, to Australia to Canada. Scientists believe this was a time before predation entered into the world.  

Ediacaran fossils take on forms of worms, simple tube shapes.  The two exceptions are the unusual looking Dickinsonia and important for our purposes the rangemorphs  You can also find an artist impression of rangemorphs [here](http://meta-gaia.angelfire.com/ediacaran_index.html)  they have a few species but charnia (#5) pteridiunum (#7) and swartpuntia (#1) looks most interesting to me. [Here's am image from a research paper that shows how their fossils look](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Ediacaran-rangeomorph-taxa-A-Beothukis-plumosa-Newfoundland-Canada-B-Fractofusus_fig1_320831404). 

So rangemorphs should look familiar to us- they look just like plants.  However, most scientists will assure us that rangemorphs are not plants for two reasons: 

1. This is 635 million years ago - which is more than 150 million years before plants were said to have evolved. 

2.  Rangemorphs are said to live on the ocean floor, too deep for photosynthesis.  


The mystery this posed to me, is that rangemorphs didn't look like creatures that could stand up to ocean currents.  Instead they looked very much like plants.  

There also didn't seem to be a concrete reason given for thinking these creature existed in the ocean. There was nothing in their context that suggested marine life, they were not around fish or anything else that could be recognized as ocean going. 

 It seemed that we simply assumed they were ocean going because we believed, based on the cambrian, that life began in the oceans and simply assumed that life in the precambrian must also be ocean bound.  There had been no soil or rock analysis to suggest that these creatures were from the ocean. . . until now 

###Gregory Retallack 

Gregory Retallack is a soil specialist that analyzed Ediacaran fossils.  Before I go into his conclusions, I want to establish his credibility a bit.  He's not a YEC, but he is a prominent scientist in the area of ancient social analysis.  

1. He discovered paleosol in the 70s (ancient soil preserved under sediments which could help teach us about plants)

2. It was his analysis that linked global cooling to the interaction between grazing animals and grass 

3. It was him who first discovered that human ancestor started walking upright in woodlands and not savannahs as previously though  

4. he discovered that permian-triassic extinction was linked to methane coming from flood basalt 

5. there are several plant fossils named after him as well as a small deer like animal from the oligocene 

6. Rettalack is not a YEC and has written several papers opposing young earth creationism 

So Gregory Retallack, the leading expert on ancient soils did the first real analysis of Edicarian soils and what did he find, as you might have guessed his findings were that they were on land, not the Ocean.  He found the following:

1. the soils have wind erosion, which is a telltale sign of land not water 

2 the rock's red color also indicates that it was on land 

3. the soils with fossils has an elephant skin appearance which is associated with dessert like appearance  

https://around.uoregon.edu/content/thin-layers-sediment-point-early-arrival-life-land

https://www.astrobio.net/origin-and-evolution-of-life/ediacarans-on-land/

admittedly Rettalack's research is not without it's detractors.  However, he says his research has always been met with staunch opposition followed by later begrudging acceptance. 

One implication of his research is that many of the creatures we previously interpreted as sea animals would turn out to be land slime molds and lichens.  Incidently, this is the biggest problem that many are taking with Rettalack's research.  Some of these creatures  don't fit in with the rest of evolutionary theory 

For example, we have always vehemently denied that rangeomorphs could be plants, because they were found deep under the ocean.  But, if they were found on land, they certainly look more like plants than they do like lichen or slime molds. 

Moreover other fossilized life, like the kimberella, currently thought to be similar to a sea mollusk [image here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Kimberella_quadrata_%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%83%99%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A9_%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BF1.jpg) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberella#/media/File:Kimberella_quadrata.jpg) 

now imagine that in terms of land animals, it looks more like fruits and seeds. 

Of course modern looking plants in the precambian era, what is supposedly the earliest period of earth's history, doesn't make much sense from the perspective of modern science.  Which is one reason why an otherwise leading researcher like Rettalack is receiving so much opposition.  However I would counter that the current view of plant evolution doesn't make much sense. 

We expected the first trees to be only 370 million years old in the form of simple tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes and the Archaeopteris.  However, I previously linked a reserach study on here that shows that a complete forrest with roots that look just like a modern forrest had already existed in the Devonian era 385 million years ago.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/edyusb/root_system_purported_to_be_385_million_years_old/

So this new picture of land plants existing much earlier does sit better with he most recent evidence.  

This is obviously also exciting news for creationists, Edicaria offers an interesting glimpse into an Eden like world of plenty.  The range of Ediacaran organisms spanned the globe suggesting that the entire earth was temperate.  There appears to be no sign of predation on any of the organisms and no insects eating away at the plants.  An interesting world.  Would the days of eden show up in the archeological record?  Did mankind spend a short or long time in Eden before being cast out.  It would be interesting if the science of archeology could hold the answer to some of these questions.",28,1577986328,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ej18fv/beginnings_of_life_on_land_mysteries_of_the/

I mean why would anyone lie just to forward evolution or creationism, it doesn't make sense. 

However, in this case, I want to add my voice that I think r/DebateEvolution is exercising outright dishonesty in the way they argue points.  I've experienced it myself with papers being cited that don't say what they claim to say, or papers being outright misquoted.  But I think rather than go in where I have a dog in the fight, it might be better to just point out a clear cut example of dishonesty.    


The post 

\&gt;No, marine fossils in Hells Creek does not support a global flood  


 has been guilded on r/debateevolution and is one of their top posts of the past month.  As usual, the post is in response to one of our members posts.  

 [m/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eaiqev/no\_marine\_fossils\_in\_hells\_creek\_does\_not\_support/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eaiqev/no_marine_fossils_in_hells_creek_does_not_support/)  


Our poster was saying that marine fossils found with terrestrial fossils are good evidence for a global flood.  Pretty reasonable stuff.   


So after uncalled for and rather vicious and ridiculous accusations of us lying, r/debateevolution goes on to lie  about the nature of hellscreek marine fossils   


let me quote  


\&gt;There is a lot of evidence that large areas of HCF was non-marine for a long period of time, so I’m going to list of 6 pieces of evidence followed by a brief discussion. All of my evidence comes from ‘Lithostratigraphy of the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota’ by Edward C. Murphy, John W. Hoganson, and Kirk R. Johnson. The paper was originally published in Geological Society of America in 2002. You can access it yourself at DOI: 10.1130/0-8137-2361-2.9.

1. Paleosols have been found in HCF, these are fossilized soil horizons.  Soil takes long periods to form.
2. Fossilized pine cones and many other varieties of plants and roots have been been found in the HCF.
3. Rivers that have flooded their banks are present in the geological record of the HCF.
4. ‘Fossilized Popcorn weathering’ that is weather than occurs when clays water content changes, most commonly found today in the badlands.
5. Fresh water mollusks, and many other non-marine fossils (including dinosaurs) have been found in HCF.
6. Coal deposits are present.  


\&gt;Due to the proximity of the Western Interior seaway, parts of the HCF were brackish and there are layers of marine sediment, but that doesn’t mean that dinosaurs swam out to see and drowned. It simply means sea level was changing. There is ample evidence to support a non-marine ecosystems existed during the HCF epoch. The creationists even agree agrees with my findings:  


\&gt;You’ll note that the authors stop just short of using this as evidence for the Noachian flood, they strongly implied it stating that the finding of marine fossils didn’t surprise ~~flood geologists~~ creationists. Yet there is abundant evidence free for anyone to check out that simply proves that a single flooding even did not occur (at least during the same time period as the deposits 

So let's take r/debateevolution's claim in two parts it's pretty clear that they are saying   


1. rivers with brackish water had flooded their river banks 
2. there is abundant evidence free for anyone to check that simply proves that a singe flooding event did not occur   


&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;What's the issue with this - note they say ""rivers have flooded their banks""   
\&gt;""fresh water mullosks and other non-marine fossils have been found.""  

\&gt;parts of the HCF were brackish and there are layers of marine sediment, but that doesn’t mean that dinosaurs swam out to see and drowned. It simply means sea level was changing. 

So what was found in hells creek?  Was it animals from brackish waters overflowing.    
Well a quick glance at the hells creek Wikipedia page says that along with fish, they also found sharks, octopuses, sea turtles and marine retitles like mosasaur.  So quick question for r/debateevolution  \- do sea turtles live in rivers or do they live in the ocean?  Do we expect sea turtles from flooding rivers with brackish waters - or would that be consistent with a flood?   


Am I the only one surprised by salt and freshwater species with land mammals being found at hells creek   


no here is a non-creation scientist saying the same thing in the New Yorker   


[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died)

&amp;#x200B;

Let's tackle the second point   


\&gt;there is abundant evidence free for anyone to check that simply proves that a singe flooding event did not occur 

Now here a research paper from Berkley saying that freshwater and marine and terrestrial animals together all dead at the same time can best be attributed to a tsunami (ie. what I call a flood)   


[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329144223.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190329144223.htm)  


So I don't know how they could not know that.  I don't know how they could pretend to read so much on hells creek and not know that freshwater and marine samples found together was considered suspicious and that scientists think there was a tsunami flood event.  The only conclusion that can be drawn is either these people are ignorant to the point of not being worth engaging  or they are not arguing in good faith.   


Now this isn't the only example of the utter dishonestly of r/debateevoluion. I've experienced many occasions where I've talked to them and realized, hey I don't think these people are arguing in good faith.  While contravening opinions and opposition is good if done in good faith - that's what I would argue that sub lacks.  I would add my voice to the others who say those people are  not worth engaging",19,1577930083,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eirg13/dishonesty_of_debateevolution_hells_creek_marine/
Creation,eintph,stcordova,Molecular Bio Physics Research Assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Genetic Entropy 2.0 (with NO dependence on definitions of information nor fitness!) -- the Structural Biology Revolution,"I'm Salvador Cordova, one of several of Dr. John Sanford's research assistants/associates. I do reporting work on developments at the National Institutes of Health and in areas of molecular biophysics that are relevant to Creation Science.

The following is a draft video (with me and PaulDouglasPrice) describing a simpler framing of Dr. Sanford's hypothesis which I hope will be accessible to a high school senior and above...


I reviewed the idea with Dr. Sanford a few days before I made this video and his only objection was I was being to generous to the evolutionary case!  lol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGWkhdWkEDw&amp;feature=youtu.be

Notable in the video is the avoidance of the term ""information"" as a basis for the genetic entropy argument.  Nor did I use the Darwinian idea of fitness, thus I avoided ill-defined dysfunctional terms in population genetic terms such as ""beneficial"", ""deleterious"", ""neutral"" because they lead down to rabbit holes.

I also avoid framing probability of protein function in terms of catalytic ability (like a lot of Darwinists do) since catalytic ability appears even for random amino acid sequence rather easily.

Instead I emphasize 3D-geometric structure.   The most cutting edge new field of biology is **STRUCTURAL biology** which examines molecular structure as it relates to function of things like proteins.  This should be rather obvious to anyone who works with machines that function is tied to structure.  So I leverage the idea of structural biology in my video.  



NOTE1:
Dr. Sanford was the author of Genetic Entropy hypothesis. The inspiration for his hypothesis came from obscure theoretical problems in population genetics.  He alludes to the theoretical problem known as ""mutational load""  in my 7-minute interview of him here:

http://www.creationevolutionuniversity.com/insight/?p=108

But the problem with ""mutation load"" and other population genetic arguments is that there are lots of confusing definitions of fitness.  For example gene loss and sickle cell traits are ""fit"".  

But as badly as the discipline of population genetics was with regard to the definition of fitness, Dr. Sanford was brilliantly able to work with the developments from this somewhat dysfunctional and use their own dysfunctional literature to demonstrate genetic entropy.  This enabled him to publish in mainstream science journals.

I call the framing of Genetic Entorpy in terms of population genetics, as Dr. Sanford did, as ""Genetic Entropy 1.0"".

That said, I've advocated totally dispensing with the flawed notions of fitness in population genetics in favor of fitness defined along more traditional notions of fitness that accord with medical and mechanical notions of health and functionality, thus avoiding absurdities that claim sickle cell anemia traits are ""fit"" traits!

In fact, as far as genetic entropy 2.0, we can dispense with the term ""fitness"" altogether, but rather focus on loss of functional structure!


NOTE2:
This is the wiki definition of structural biology:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology

You'll note, evolutionary theory is pretty much useless to understanding 3D structure and function, and thus pretty much useless to the most cutting edge area of biology.",4,1577912939,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eintph/genetic_entropy_20_with_no_dependence_on/

An example of reductive evolution are things like tape worms that have lost entire organs or other creatures losing whole sets of functional genes.

BUT, WitchDoc's thread is IRRELEVANT!    One of the TOP evolutionary biologists on the planet has said reductive evolution is the dominant mode of evolution. 

That said, here is the WIKI article on it:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductive_evolution

&gt;Reductive evolution is the process by which microorganisms remove genes from their genome. It can occur when bacteria found in a free-living state enter a restrictive state (either as endosymbionts or parasites) or are completely absorbed by another organism becoming intracellular (symbiogenesis). The bacteria will adapt to survive and thrive in the restrictive state by altering and reducing its genome to get rid of the newly redundant pathways that are provided by the host.[1] In an endosymbiont or symbiogenesis relationship where both the guest and host benefit, the host can also undergo reductive evolution to eliminate pathways that are more efficiently provided for by the guest.[2]

That wiki article puts a real evoltionary spin on things, and adds some falsehoods too!

Nothing, in light of Haldane's comments would restrict the idea to only micro organisms!

What I feel WitchDoc did was to equivocate and obfuscate and throw red herrings on the topic of Reductive Evolution.   I'm not saying it was deliberate, but that was the net result.",1,1577895383,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eijzsn/are_enucleated_blood_cells_an_example_of/

Creation,ei36op,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,The Rise of Anti-Science,"Western culture has had a lot of ups &amp; downs over the last couple of centuries, but the anchor for it was the concept of an orderly universe:  

1. Consistency in natural law. 
2. Use of the scientific method. 
3. Yhe logical pursuit of truth. 
4. Peer review, critical thinking, &amp; skepticism were a balance to 'science by decree'  

These concepts reached their heyday in post ww2 America. Engineers &amp; scientific researchers leapfrogged advancement after advancement dazzling everyone with their ability to harness natural law as a tool.

But to some, these things were not seen as a harnessing of laws of physics, but a creative &amp; almost godlike power. A mystique built up around the fields of engineering &amp; science, &amp; it was a magnet to young people when they pursued a career. The fields of technology were major draws in the middle of the last century in America. Breakthroughs in medicine, manufacturing, computers, &amp; just about every part of human life has been positively affected by these technological advances, &amp; families encouraged their children to be part of that growth &amp; advancement of humanity.

The technological advances brought unprecedented prosperity &amp; luxurious conditions for even the poorest in the nation. And as often has happened throughout history, with prosperity comes complacency &amp; growing lethargy. Hard work loses its appeal, &amp; easy living seems to be an easier route. Why work hard if you don't have to?

And as the culture has declined, so has the magnet for technology. Fewer &amp; fewer American youth desire a career in science or engineering. Non productive elements of society have taken center stage:  Sports, entertainment, celebrity worship, money shuffling.. these things are valued &amp; esteemed over the mundane &amp; difficult scientific disciplines.

Now, we are in a time of anti-science. Social issues &amp; cultural manipulation is taking place, *claiming*  'science!' as a basis. But instead of open scrutiny, mandates. Instead of the scientific method, decrees. Instead of logic &amp; critical thinking, truth is declared.  Propaganda has become the new goal. Truth becomes what the establishment says, rather than something based on reason or facts. *Critical thinking* is not encouraged, just memorized dogma. History is not taught as dispassionate facts, but to mold a belief. Conclusions are presupposed, &amp; memorized, instead of arrived at by research &amp; thinking. THIS is the greatest failure of American education, which once was a beacon of classic liberal thought.. Now, it is just another state propaganda tool.

The problem is the rise of elitism.. looking to 'experts' to guide us. It is the dumbing down of the nation, &amp; the disdain for REAL science &amp; the scientific method. It is a tragic loss for our thought processes as a people. Instead of having the basic tools to research, think, &amp; evaluate data &amp; logic, we are told to 'trust the smart people!.' Everything is much too complex for us common mortals to grasp, &amp; we need the elite experts to declare truth to us. In centuries past, we had the divinity of kings, or divinely appointed priests &amp; popes, to declare absolute truth to us. Now, we have the divinity of experts.. degreed elites who pontificate Truth, &amp; we must bow in obeisance.

As the adoration of elitism grew, so did education transform as a classic liberal tool of enlightenment to a State propaganda tool of indoctrination. At one time, critical thinking was emphasized, &amp; 'liberal' meant an expansive, enlightened, open minded view of things.. a broader view of the nuances in thought, ideology, &amp; critical thinking processes. Now, it is indoctrination.. dogma is pounded into young people, so they do NOT think or consider alternatives, but have everything neatly defined for them, complete with demonizing any alternate views.

The result has been LESS thought, more dogma, &amp; a subservient citizenry. The concept of human liberty is redefined, &amp; revisionist history is shoved down people's throats. Open, scientific method based inquiry is squashed, while memorized indoctrination is mandated. The results are clear:

 Less educated citizenry.   
 No sense of history or continuity.  
A Dogmatic view of life &amp; simplistic solutions.  
Bumper sticker slogans.

Creation,ehrkjs,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.Creation,,How would a Young Earth Creationist interpret these data?,"This is a chart that has come up a few times over the past few weeks, and I want to make sure that I’m not missing any possibly YEC rebuttals to it.

My question is: how would you interpret this chart as a YEC?

Not trying to debate. I won’t take issue with answers here (or crosspost them on any other sub). Just want to make sure my knowledge of the opposing side’s view is complete, for which the environment of the debate subs isn't always ideally conducive :)

-----

Basically, the scenario is this.

YECs say that radiometric dating methods rest on one or more unproven assumptions. Old Earthers say that radiometric dating methods are usually reliable.

A simple way of testing this hypothesis is by performing different radiometric dates on the same stratum (in this case, the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary).

Since these tests were performed by different labs independently, and using three different methods, with isotopes of different halflives, etc, we would expect these data to be generally *concordant* if the assumptions underlying radiometric dating were true (as Old Earthers say), and we’d expect them to be generally *discordant* if the assumptions were false (as YEC say). After all, there is no reason why false methods should independently agree.

Here’s the result of multiple radiometric analyses on rock from the same stratigraphic boundary. Please note that the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary was established stratigraphically, not by radiometric dating, so there's no circularity here.

Creation,ehra6w,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.Creation,,Why we shouldn’t ‘see people with dinosaurs’,"This is a common evolutionist question to supposedly refute Flood geology (and, by extension, biblical creation): “If people lived with and died in the Flood with dinosaurs, why aren’t they buried together?” This is very misleading and we should not expect to ‘find people with dinosaurs’ for the following reasons.

*Low population before the Flood* People, according to the Bible, were very murderous and evil before the Flood. We should not assume that their overall population is more than ours today, or even more than a few million. Given 7 billion people before the Flood, we can calculate how many people would be buried in how much sediment. There are 2.1\*10^18 tons of Phanerozoic (Flood) sediment [1](https://mem.lyellcollection.org/content/10/1/284), and the average density of sedimentary rock is 2.65 g/cm^3[2](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Ancillary_Materials/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Exemplars/Geology/Density_of_Rocks_and_Soils ). After some calculation, I found that there are 2.1 billion km^3 of Phanerozoic sediment, and so there could be up to as many as 1 human fossil per... 300,000,000 cubic meters. Wow.

*Pulverization during the Flood* Fossils, human or otherwise, would have been pulverized often during a universal, catastrophic Deluge. This is pretty obvious, and given that humans would probably not be buried and fossilized until near the end (the EROSIVE stage of the Flood), this would be even more likely. Plus, even if single human bones or parts of bones survived, they were probably misidentified.

*Erosion after the Flood* Many respectable creation scientists believe that Cenozoic rocks were deposited after the Flood, and for good reason too [3](http://creationicc.org/abstract.php?pk=254) [4](http://creationicc.org/abstract.php?pk=255). If this amount of erosion and deposition occurred, fossils near the surface (dinosaur/possible human fossils) would have been eroded away quickly by post-Flood erosion, and then buried deeper.

For these three reasons, we would not expect human fossils to be mixed in with other fossils from the Flood. However, the evolutionist argument extends further than just humans, and we could ask why modern animals aren’t mixed in with Flood fossils. Here are some reasons why we wouldn’t expect this either:

*The Founder’s Effect* We shouldn’t expect anatomically modern animals to be found with Flood fossils because of the founder’s effect. This effect says that if a population is reduced to a small amount (such as two and seven on Noah’s ark), then there will be a significant loss of genetic variability [5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect). So, after the Flood, small populations from each baramin became what we see today. But this is only a small taste of diversity before the Flood, so we see many more different animals than modern animals in the fossil record.

*Post-Flood Diversification* As I said earlier, many creationists think that the Cenozoic is post-Flood. Cenozoic rocks show a lot of change and diversification due to loss of variability, especially directly after the Flood [4](http://creationicc.org/abstract.php?pk=255). Since these animals are now very different from those before and directly after the Flood, we shouldn’t expect to see many modern animals in the fossil record.

*We do!* Contrary to the points just made, we actually *do* see anatomically modern animals in the fossil record! For example, Gansus looks quite like a modern duck, and if you go online you will see many other examples.

So, to conclude, the argument that modern animals and humans should be found with dinosaurs is flawed. Evolutionists need to stop using it, because it really has been refuted a thousand times. This argument is different from the argument that birds should be found with pterosaurs, which I will be addressing soon.",26,1577736413,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ehra6w/why_we_shouldnt_see_people_with_dinosaurs/
Creation,ehmzwm,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.Creation,,Excerpt from the preface to Pollard &amp; Earnshaw's (secular) Cell Biology textbook,"&gt; **""It is therefore tempting to compare cells to a complex piece of machinery, like a jet airliner, whose complexity may rival certain aspects of the cell. However, cells are much more complex than jet airliners.""** 

Dr Fred Hoyle's 'tornado in a junkyard' analogy is here vindicated and then some!

Disappointingly, we also get a window into how a faith commitment to the dogma of evolution can lead to wrong assumptions driving the research efforts of scientists in the field:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""Given the complexity of the molecular inventory (about 35,000 different genes in humans), gaining an understanding of the details of molecular interactions might, in principle, be equivalent to the daunting task of learning a set of 35,000 Chinese characters and all the rules of spelling and grammar that govern their use. However, it is already clear that the origin of complex life forms by evolution has simplified the task. For example, although the genome encodes about 800 protein kinases (enzymes that transfer a phosphate from ATP to a protein), each kinase has much in common with all other kinases because of their evolution from a common ancestor.""**

Obviously, the assumption of evolution is not 'clear' but rather is taken as axiomatic from the start. Given the aforementioned astonishing complexity (implying design!), the fact that we find patterns of common similar traits in the genome (like kinases), much more naturally leads to the conclusion of a common *designer*. For example, we have screwdrivers with many different types of heads on them, but they share the common trait of all being screwdrivers, and they all function similarly. This is because they are tools for a common purpose and they were designed.",45,1577717817,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ehmzwm/excerpt_from_the_preface_to_pollard_earnshaws/

While it is a religion :) this is the one thing Evo's(exluding theistic Evo's)want to be known as, a belief system. This is more frequent so alot of them have already gotten used to it.

&gt;4. Abiogenesis is(part of) Evolution.

Everytime these two words go near eachother, the Evo's pounce right on it like a cat after a lighter. While this may be used at either the incredulity of the Creationist or the horrible boundaries of the Evolutionist, it is still a show to watch after making this claim in any way, shape, or form.

&gt;3. Creationism and historical science are both real science.

The amount of comments that flood my inbox after I say this is, well, it's staggering. They really despise anything that Creationists have to offer, even though it is real scientific progress.

&gt;2. Peer-reviewed Creationist research paper.

Creation,eh4u7o,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,No Creator? No morality. No equality. No natural law. No America,"In a godless universe, the concepts of morality, inherent rights, and human equality do not exist, except as delusional platitudes.

How can they?

**Morality**, to be a Real Thing, has to be imbedded in the psyche of man. With no Embedder, right and wrong are meaningless platitudes, invented by the whims of man, for manipulation purposes. In a godless universe, amorality, or whatever you want is all there is. Any attempts to 'standardize' a moral code is just arbitrary opinions enforced by human power.

**Human equality** is a delusion, in a godless universe. Humans are just animals, at different stages of evolution, and the smarter and more 'fit' will be the ones to survive. Delusional, superstitious, and simple minded sheep are there to be exploited by the more highly evolved, advanced humans, and should be managed by the same. Power, deception, intimidation, brutality, cunning, manipulation, and anything necessary to achieve this goal is a positive. The ends justify the means.

**Natural Law**, like morality, can only exist as a Real Thing, if it was embedded by a Creator. An 'inherent right' carries with it an Embedder of these rights. The Enlightenment definition of Natural Law is the inherent right of everyone to *life, liberty, and property.* But in a godless universe, these are empty platitudes.. no Creator? No Natural Law. Rights are privileges granted by the ruling elite, and are not inherent.

America was founded upon principles that can only come through a Creator.  The 'self evident' truths that this nation was founded upon hinges entirely on them being embedded by a Creator, that EVERYONE senses, inherently.

*We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness...* ~the Declaration of Independence

The foundations of America are premised upon a Creator, embedding Natural rights, morality, and equality. In a godless universe, the foundations of America are built upon a lie.. a delusion of equality, morality, and inherent rights.",9,1577617910,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eh4u7o/no_creator_no_morality_no_equality_no_natural_law/
Creation,eh40vt,vivek_david_law,,t2_526vfq87,self.Creation,,In convincing people the truth of YEC: The issue isn't science or the theory of evolution; the issue is philosophy and epistemology,"This is sort of a part II to my last post specifically addressing a recent set of posts here about how to get more people to believe in YEC, first from a YEC proponent and then later from an atheist who self identified as here to help.  

The post by the YEC seemed to decry the fact that we were losing ground and our scientists were in the minority.  The post by the atheist suggested that we stay away from scientific justification altogether and if we venture there avoid it unless we have what this person identified as a scientific basis.

###The issue 

And I think both these posts fall into the trap of assuming that creationism and YEC are contradicted by modern science.  We're both starting at the same place and the same assumption.  Atheists assume that scientific theories like Darwinism, radiometric dating etc. contradict a young earth and creationism and claim to thus reject creationism, young earth and god.  

Creationists seem to accept that scientific theories like Darwinism and radiometric dating contradict creationism, a young earth and God and thus argue against these things.  The problem from my perspective is we're starting from the same place and the same base assumptions that the atheists are starting from and accepting them without creation.  I think if we start examining these assumptions, things start falling apart.  

##Philosophical not Scientific Problem 

What I realized from reading the posts, and from reading a lot of the posts on r/debateevolution is the problem for YEC is not a scientific conundrum.  Let me repeat that.  The problem for young earth creationists is not a scientific problem.  Science does not contradict creationism.  Science does not contradict a young Earth. The problem is not even that most science, or established science, or academia contradicts a young earth view. The problem is that most of us don't know what we are talking about when we talk about science or scientific truth or what counts as valid knowledge.  

So to give an example - when an atheist naturalist says that ""Darwinian evolution is true and thus intelligent design is false"" that sounds like a scientific claim.  It's not, it's an epistemological claim, it is a claim about what is true and what counts as valid knowledge.

To demonstrate this, let's ask a few questions about this claim:  Is the fact that something is a scientific theory enough to make it valid knowledge that is irrational to reject.  Are we irrational if we don't believe in dark matter for example?   What about those reputable scientists that reject dark matter and propose alternative theories, are they being irrational?  Was Gould being irrational and unscientific when he rejected incremental Darwinian natural selection as the major factor in speciation and proposed macro mutation as an alternative?  See you start asking a few simple questions and the whole framework proposed by most atheist naturalists and their claims to science starts to fall apart.  That's when it becomes clear that the question is not science, it's epistemology .

Another claim that I see often is ""God and miracles cannot be scientifically examined, and thus cannot be accepted.""  Again we unquestioningly accept this.  But what's the basis for this claim.  Is this a scientific claim or a philosophical claim.  Again, it's clearly the later, because science what counts as science and what can be examined by science is a part of the field of philosophy called the philosophy of science.  

##The Problem of the Philosophy Ignorant Culture 

We live in a philosophy ignorant culture.  Often when I hear philosophers quoted it's completely out of context to their work and the quote isn't even philosophy.  We don't even apply philosophy to basic philosophical questions, we think it's a waste of time. 

This is a new modern development, and I think it's the source of this apparent science Young Earth conflict. 

So for example in the recent friendly atheist thread, I asked about what science is - and was told that ""this is quibbling over terminology.""  And I think that's the kind of attitude many people take towards scientific problems.  

In debate evolution I asked them the same question - and got a variety of answers.  But the interesting part is I said poppers falsifiability doesn't count and there was a huge debate on that issue with many people holding that it still counts.  

I want to expand on this, because I read popper and despite disagreeing with him I love his theory. The reason I love popper is he was the philosopher that introduced the problem of demarcation - the theory of how we define science and what counts as science and what doesn't.  That was the whole point of his theory. 

Falsifiability is touted in science as the basis for scientific knowledge except problems with it include the fact that it was written in the 50s and there are almost no falsifiability or popperians in the philosophy of science.  It's not generally accepted and there is no movement. Even more importantly, falsifiability as proposed by Popper actually doesn't sit well with how most scientists talk about science. For example, falsifiability rejects empiricism, he said that no amount of observation can verify a scientific theory but a single counterexample will completely invalidate it.  Think about that - this means Darwinian evolution and radiometric dating have already been falsified and should be rejected.  Of course wef don't actually do that, we try and find explanations for the counterexample or leave it as a counterexample that has yet to be explained and say that in the words of our helpful atheist who said he worked in science ""all theories have flaws and a single flaw doesn't invalidate a theory""

There are other aspects of falsifiability that very few people would accept today if they knew actually knew what the theory said more than ""hey gotta be able to prove it false.""  But unfortunately, we've decided that philosophy doesn't matter and thus have become a simplistic generation with a simplistic philosophical outlook.  

And this is what gives rise to the simplistic assertions that go unquestioned like ""God isn't scientific"" or ""YEC and God must be rejected because they are unscientific"" 

###Some Simple Applications 

I think some simple take-aways to get started are: 

What we call science is important and has implications on what is reliable and what is not reliable knowledge. 

We're doing things like testing the boiling point of water at sea level, calculating the growth rate of mold spores at given temperatures, making up broad ranging theories on the origin of species, taking notes on patients made by freud, taking unobserved mathematical calculations on the possible effects of minimum wage increases and surveying and living with gang members in south side Chicago and calling the whole darn thing science.  Science is applied indiscriminately to a wide variety of things with varying degrees of reliability and trustworthiness and assuming they have the same level of authority.  

Even Darwinian evolution is a conflation - we take natural selection, genetics, geology and a whole host of other things, combine them, assume they are all equally reliable and take it for granted that they all unquestionably prove that Darwinian evolution is an epistemological truth that must be accepted by all rational beings. 

A big part of the foundations of rejecting the simplistic view of this is science, so this is 100% true and must be rejected by all rational beings can also be derrived from scientists themslves.  Cause really, good scientists - (actual scientists - not people at debateevolution) will tell you this outright and are often very honest about it.  

 For example radiometric dating is called absolute dating, but that name is often rejected by scientists who fear that it may give the false impression that the dates are absolutely certain.  It also assumes that we know the way radioactive isotopes form and dissipate over long periods of time - which we know from radio carbon dating is not true - since it doesn't match with dendrochronology even over short periods.  

Further the scientists calculating the age of the universe will tell you this is based on various assumptions, like our current knowledge or star formation, and that different techniques for measuring the age of the universe give different results.  It is also based on the assumption that certain of our theorems are correct, and most scientists themselves will be open about the holes and assumptions and unknowns in these theories. 

##Pop Science 

I think the real enemy is pop science rather than science.  Pop science has very little relation to science but is science as it is decimated in the popular press. It arbitrarily labels certain things as science, certain people as scientists and then presents every scientific paper, study and theory as 100% accurate and beyond question.  It presents the age of the earth and universe as something meticulously calculated to exacting degrees with various methods agreed on. It presents evolution as a simple theory that has been observed and verified and beyond question since the time Darwin sailed to galapagos and invented it.  It fails to present it as a broad ranging theory with various constituent parts, some of which have been observed and verified and some which haven't, some which have strong support and others don't. 

I think the real fight for YEC is not to present an alternative science or to attack current scientific theories but to give people a more realistic understanding of what science is, how it works, and more importantly, to get people to understand at least basic philosophy of science and etymology.  Maybe the solution isn't to find a way to give people the right answers, but instead fight a way to get people to ask the right questions.",26,1577611107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eh40vt/in_convincing_people_the_truth_of_yec_the_issue/
Creation,eh3fyi,vivek_david_law,,t2_526vfq87,self.Creation,,"Unpopular Opinion: Most people are already creationists,","So a recent post on here has gotten a lot of attention from the atheist/ debate evolution contingent. The question was how how we fight evolution and the lie that the earth is much much older than it is.

##What most people call evolution is actually creationism 

I want to weigh in on this because I don't think many people actually believe in evolution, instead they believe in a pop culture version of evolution which resembles creationism more than it does darwinism.  Specifically, people believe in the march of progress version of evolution - going from simple, less advanced life forms and progressing to the greatest life form - human

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March\_of\_Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Progress)

[https://www.wired.com/2009/11/the-march-of-progress-has-deep-roots/](https://www.wired.com/2009/11/the-march-of-progress-has-deep-roots/)

 I noticed that was the big cry among many in that field - how the public had misinterpreted evolution to think of it as a linear march of progress with humans at the end.

Of course, this isn't evolution, it's closer to creation - because it assumes that there is some force, or purpose at work in nature to direct creation in a particular direction leading to humans.  Of course this doesn't resemble the Christian god, it's closer to animism or karma like concepts that you see in primitive religions, but imo that is the dominant religion of our age in the West - belief in these vague karma animism like concepts.  We just don't realize it but many people, Christians included picture God in the same way animists think about it or Hindus think about the ultimate God - as a sort of vague background force that nudges things in particular directions.

So my point is, evolution, in the Darwinian sense is not the dominant belief anywhere outside of academia and never has been.  We don't even have to hit at the concept because most people don't really believe it and aren't really even aware of what it really means.

##Implications for Creationists 

Of course this doesn't mean our work is done.  The current popular evolutionary view is still not compatible with a purposeful creator such as the God of the bible. The notion of God creating a whole universe, waiting about 10 billion years, then creating the earth waiting another 3 billion years, and then creating multicellular life that went from a period of transitions from amphibians to dinosaurs etc over a period of about 500 million years before creating mankind . . . While this idea is compatible with the modernist notion of God, it doesn't really fit well with the Christian notion of God who made mankind in his own image.  


###Age of the Universe 

I think the big issue isn't how life came to be, it's the age of the world and the universe.  And this part presents a problem.  I think u/saggysalthealth is correct - most people believe the age of the earth is billions of years old.  And I think that's the real problem.  

Part of this is people believe the experts who tell them that there are a variety of dating methods that can date the age of rocks and also various astronomical models that utilize satellites to calculate the age of the universe.  

Of course certainty in these calculations is contradicted by the scientists utilizing the methods.  For example radiometric dating is called absolute dating, but that name is often rejected by scientists who fear that it may give the false impression that the dates are absolutely certain.  It also assumes that we know the way radioactive isotopes form and dissipate over long periods of time - which we know from radio carbon dating is not true - since it doesn't match with dendrochronology even over short periods.  

Further the scientists calculating the age of the universe will tell you this is based on various assumptions, like our current knowledge or star formation, and that different techniques for measuring the age of the universe give different results.  It is also based on the assumption that certain of our theorems are correct, which we know 

Despite the fact that these numbers are just best guesses, they are presented in the popular press as precise exacting calculations.  Therefore march on confidently, believe that science has unlocked the key to the age of the universe.  This image is presented in the popular science press as presenting the age of things as perfectly defined. 

##Implications for us 

The issue with this is it is not compatible with a purposeful creator such as the God of the bible. The notion of God creating a whole universe, waiting about 10 billion years, then creating the earth waiting another 3 billion years, and then creating multicellular life that went from a period of transitions from amphibians to dinosaurs etc over a period of about 500 million years before creating mankind . . . While this idea is compatible with the modernist notion of God, it doesn't really fit well with the Christian notion of God who made mankind in his own image.  

I do want to address this but I think it's an issue big enough to warrant a whole another post",14,1577606406,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eh3fyi/unpopular_opinion_most_people_are_already/

But why would it be considered a loss of genetic information - or if it *can* be considered a loss of information, why does it also not demonstrate a gain (or re-gaining) of information? The entire story is: increasing pollution causes moths to become darker, and then *decreasing* pollution causes them to become lighter again.

Creation,egqth6,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Natural Selection,"In this continuing series of examination of evidence for The Creator, i will look at natural selection. Man directed breeding is also included in this inquiry.

Breeding and natural selection is the process of 'selecting' traits that are desirable, and deselecting those that aren't. Most of us grew up with the image of light colored moths, in preindustrial England, evolving into dark colored moths, as coal soot from greedy industrialists choked the planet with fossil fuel emissions.

What do we observe, regarding genetic diversity in an organism?

1. Lower levels of diversity tend to spell extinction of a particular haplogroup.
2. As the tips of a haplotree extend, the diversity **decreases.**
3. Some low diversity organisms, like sharks and cockroaches, continue for extended generations, with mimimal changes in their levels of diversity.
4. There is no evidence, of increasing genetic information, in ANY isolated haplogroup. They either have the traits needed to survive, or they don't.

This from a study about cats..
https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiger-lion-and-domestic-cat-genes-not-so-different

*The data can help scientists monitor genetic diversity and aid in conservation efforts, Waits says. Snow leopards have *  ,  **low levels of genetic diversity,**,   *the researchers found, nearly half that of the other big cat species. Low genetic diversity can be a sign that a species is heading toward extinction.*

*Cats in general have low levels of diversity, says Marcella Kelly, a population ecologist at Virginia Tech. “I get more worried if an animal has lost diversity recently,” she says. The researchers have DNA of only one snow leopard, so they don’t know whether the animals naturally have low levels or if their genetic diversity has taken a dive.*

How do you even get 'low levels of diversity', if an organism is constantly creating new genetic information? If the assumptions of common descent were true, there would be new traits and variation constantly added, and haplogroups becoming **more** diverse, instead of less.

Natural selection and breeding, are DEVOLUTION processes.. the organism is becoming LESS diverse, genetically, with fewer traits to pick from, in their lottery pick of genes.

Natural selection is evidence AGAINST common ancestry, and does not provide any evidence that it can or did happen.

This point is critical evidence against the theory of universal common ancestry.

How can organisms 'advance' into more complexity, if they are in reality, '**devolving', and decreasing in variability**?

How do you reconcile the OBSERVABLE reality of fewer traits being available, in a 'low diversity' organism, with the belief that they are constantly adding new traits, genes, chromosomes, etc? How could common ancestry be possible, when organisms DECREASE in variability, through natural or man made selection?",17,1577540196,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/egqth6/evidence_for_the_creator_natural_selection/

I'm an atheist and I'm here to help

The title is intended to be a little but humorous, but the sentiment is both serious and sincere.  Yes, I'm an atheist, but I'm not your typical atheist.  I [run a Bible study at my local church](https://www.meetup.com/Bible-Study-for-Skeptics-Agnostics-and-Apologists/).  I have been semi-lurking on /r/creation for a couple of years now because I believe that it is important to study and understand points of view with which one does not agree.  I believe I have now come to a pretty good understanding of the creationist position, thanks largely to /u/jmscwss which whom I had a [very long and incredibly productive exchange earlier this year](http://blog.rongarret.info/2019/03/can-scientist-find-common-ground-with).

Recently /u/SaggysHealthAlt posted an entry entitled [""How can we make Creationism popular again?""](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ee082j/how_can_we_make_creationism_popular_again/) lamenting the fact that YEC is such an unpopular position even among Christians and wondering what could be done about it.  I've decided to post this long-form response in a genuine attempt to provide a constructive answer to the question.  This is not intended to be a backhanded attack on creationism.  I try to be mindful of the fact that I'm a guest here, but I also approach this in the hope that at the end of the day we all share a common goal: to find the truth.  In service of that goal, here is some advice on what you should do if you want to convince someone like me that creationism is true.

1.  Decide whether you want to raise a scientific argument or a theological one.    I believe that the failure to achieve clarity on this is the fundamental (no pun intended) reason that creationism is not taken seriously.  Creationism often presents itself as a scientific position, but AFAICT after hanging out here for several years it is in fact a theological position: if the Bible is the Word of God, and the Bible says that the earth was created in seven days, then it must be true because God wouldn't lie.  BTW, I have a fair amount of respect for that position.  It's logically coherent and intellectually honest.  If you raise this argument, then your quarrel is not with me, it's with your fellow Christians who have different hermeneutics.  We can, if you want, have a discussion about whether or not God exists at all, but there is absolutely no point in talking about the age of the earth because you and I have begun with radically different premises, so it's hardly surprising that we would arrive at radically different conclusions.

However, for reasons that I still don't entirely understand, some creationists do not seem to be content to defend creationism on theological grounds.  They seem to want it to be taken seriously as a *scientific* position.  If you are one of those people, then you have a much tougher row to hoe.  For example, if you want to use the Bible (or any other holy text) as a source you have to first establish its reliability as a source of scientific knowledge, i.e. you have to establish its credibility *on the evidence*, not on the basis of faith.  There are so many problems with that I hardly know where to begin, but I'll just point out that, at the very least, you're going to have to answer the Islamic critique that the Bible has been corrupted by humans, and that only the Quran is a reliable source of knowledge.

You should also recognize that the truth has no obligation to conform to our desires.  The Christian world view is very appealing (I believe that is why there are so many Christians).  It would be wonderful if the universe were run by an all-powerful all-knowing all-loving God.  But just because it would be wonderful doesn't mean that it's true.  Even if God exists, and even if the Bible is the Word of God, there remains the possibility that, for example, God could be a trickster.  If you want to argue *scientifically* that God is not a trickster, then you have to do it *on the evidence* and not on what the Bible says, because if God is a trickster then, by definition, his word is not reliable.

2.  Recognize that pointing out a flaw in the theory of evolution is not, in and of itself, an argument in favor of creationism.  It may simply be that you have identified a flaw in the theory of evolution that needs to be and can be fixed.  This sort of thing happens in science all the time.  The entire scientific enterprise consists almost entirely of identifying flaws in existing theories and fixing them.  So if you have in fact identified a flaw in evolutionary theory, that is great!  Publish it!  That is the first step towards progress.

However, you should be aware that the odds that you have in fact identified a flaw in evolutionary theory are very small.  This is not to say that there aren't flaws; there almost certainly are.  But Origin of Species was published in 1859, so scientists have been busy working on identifying and fixing flaws in the theory for 160 years now.  All of the low-lying fruit in this regard has almost certainly been picked already.  Identifying a flaw in evolutionary theory is the first step towards getting a Ph.D. in biology or geology, possibly even a Nobel Prize in physics.  So the Bayesian prior on your having successfully done this is very small.  (And if you don't know what a Bayesian prior is, then you definitely have some homework to do before you can expect to be taken seriously.)

At the very least, you should read [this](http://blog.rongarret.info/2008/10/evolution-101-done-right.html).

3.  Don't confuse evolution and abiogenesis.  The fastest way to identify yourself as an ignorant quack is to raise the tornado-in-a-junkyard-building-a-747 argument.  (Why is it always a 747 anyway?  Is there something special about that airframe that endears it to the creationist's heart?)  Evolution is NOT random.  Evolution consists of TWO main components.  One of them is random, but the other one isn't.  Again, you really need to understand this before you start to criticize evolution if you want anyone who isn't already on board to take you seriously.

4.  Don't raise arguments-from-ignorance.  Yes, it is true that science does not yet know exactly how (or even if) abiogenesis happened, nor does it know the exact lineage of every species that has ever existed.  But there was a time when science didn't know how electricity worked.  The fact that we have not yet figured out how nature does something is not a valid argument that God did it.

5.  If you want to raise a mathematical argument (e.g. that the probability of accumulating beneficial mutations is too low for evolution to occur, or that evolution cannot produce information) then show me the math, preferably in the form of a citation to a peer-reviewed paper, but at the very least, to a blog post somewhere, or to some broad-brushstroke calculations that you have done yourself.  (If you really want to impress me, show me where the errors are in the math of accepted evolutionary theory.)

5.  Don't raise conspiracy theories.  If you want to argue that the entire scientific enterprise is engaged in a coordinated effort to hide a plain and simple truth that should be self-evident to any thinking person, then you will find kindred spirits among the flat-earthers and the lunar-landing-denialists, but you will not persuade anyone who isn't already wearing a tinfoil hat.  Conspiracy theories are, by their very nature, non-falsifiable and hence unscientific.

This is not to say that you can't argue that there is bias in the scientific establishment.  There probably is.  What you can't argue (if you want to be taken seriously) is that there is a sustained, coordinated, deliberate, and ultimately *successful* effort to stamp out what those in authority know in their heart of hearts to be the truth.  So don't cite Ben Stein's movie.

Creation,efwbvs,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Flavours and scents of fruit/flowers,"Flowers and fruit produce absolutely staggering numbers of compounds  that give the flower its fragrance. A quick online search shows that there are over 300 compounds that combine to make the fragrance of a rose. [""The scent of roses comes from one or more of over 300 compounds, which, because of their different boiling points, evaporate at different times, so the the aroma changes over time.""](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/everyday-chemistry/0/steps/22300). and [""a particular isomer of rose oxide (which has 4 different isomers), and the one which contributes the typical floral rose fragrance. It’s detectable by our noses at very low concentrations in air – down as low as 5 parts per billion.""](https://www.compoundchem.com/2015/02/12/flowers/).

Regarding the flavour of chocolate, 
""About 600 various compounds (alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and pyrazines) have been identified as odor‐active components.""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12180)

So ... where do all of these aromatic compounds get produced? I really don't know. Does anyone here know? What floral organ produces all of the molecules to make a rose's scent, or are there different organs? I assume that there are some cells near the centre of the rose whose function is to produce a lot of fragrant compounds.

Now, none of this is any use at all unless there is some other organism that can appreciate the flavour or fragrance. Insects must have receptors to detect the fragrance of flowers, but perhaps not as many as we have with our much larger olfactory bulbs.

I don't really think that any of this makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. Flowers and insects would have to co-evolve (if that is possible - I know that it's a hypothesis based on ""it must have happened this way"") otherwise what's the evolutionary advantage to either producing fragrance with no one to detect it or having sensors to detect floral scents when there are no flowers that are fragrant? It wouldn't happen.

The other thing is the absolutely staggering number and complexity of the flavours and fragrances. Why would a rose need 300 compounds and not just 3 or 10? This makes no sense from an evolutionary point of view, but it fits exactly with an exuberant highly creative and artistic Creator.  God loves diversity and beauty and has made things for us to sense that are almost overwhelming in their beauty.  You can't do this with just one molecule. We can make artificial vanilla using synthetic vanillin, but it won't taste like the real thing. (Natural vanilla extract is a mixture of several hundred different compounds in addition to vanillin). 

That's my thought for the week. Enjoy the abundant creation, the complex interplay in nature of all of our senses, and marvel at the mind that created it. Roses don't just have an amazing fragrance (except for modern ones where it's been bred out of them), but also a fascinating soft texture of rose petals, a very complex spatial arrangement of the petals as they open up, and delicate colour transitions from various shades of pink to salmon to yellow, etc.",10,1577372242,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/efwbvs/flavours_and_scents_of_fruitflowers/

The majesty, awesomeness, terror, and vastness of the universe fills us, with a sense of worshipful wonder. The naturalistic explanations and beliefs are too far fetched. Reflecting on the abstracts of infinity, eternity, life, and the Creation brings us to a sense of holy awe, of all that 'God hath wrought..'

Ps19:1 ..*The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork*.

Romans1:18*The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature*—**have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made,** *so that people are without excuse.

21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.

24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator.*.

Poets, gurus, philosophers and wise people from every corner of the human experience look in AWE, at the wonder of The Creation.  But years of Indoctrination,  and/or complete immersion in man-made trivialities can numb the senses, and scar the Soul of man, so he cannot hear the music of the spheres.

I'm going with Jefferson and the American founders, here:

*We hold these truths to be* **self-evident**, *that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government...*. ~the Declaration of Independence

This was the basis for the founding of that Great Experiment in self rule and human equality: America

The founders claimed it was 'self-evident' to see human equality, natural law, and personal sovereignty, based on the SELF EVIDENT truth of a Creator. Nobody had the right to rule over, exploit, oppress, or enslave another person, because we were all equal under God. We are His creation, accountable only to Him, not to a self-appointed elite or stand-in pretender.

So what happened? How has this Great Truth fallen from the lofty position of respect, and is now drowning in a flood of State centered elitism?

Simple:   **Indoctrination.**

Beginning around the turn of the last century, progressive ideologues began to seize control of all human institutions, control the information, and produce a steady stream of propaganda, to mold tools of subservience. They have taken over all educational systems, the judicial branch, the press, the entertainment media, and infest all facets of government. 

EVERYONE who has attended public (and most private) schools, observed public tv (or radio), visited national parks, attended most churches, watched movies, read newspapers, and just about every facet of Americana, has been subject to State Sponsored Indoctrination, via a stream of constant propaganda.

This propaganda stream is constantly challenging and questioning the existence and benevolence of God (hath God said?), and drives people to the flawed belief in a godless universe. But it is nothing but a delusion from an enemy of God, who is hell bent on destroying His Work.

Evolutionist: Ever heard of glacial eratics?  Look it up. 
 
Intelligent Design Proponent: In a perfect circle, with uniformly arranged lintels?

Evolutionist: It is not a perfect circle, you know.  Some of those stones are just lying around on the ground.

Intelligent Design Proponent:  Maybe those fell over.

Evolutionist:  Special pleading fallacy.  Why should those be natural but the others, which are clearly part of the same formation, be designed?

Intelligent Design Proponent: But those lintels, the humongous stones across the top, have mortice holes, and the upright supporting stones have protruding tenons that fit exactly into those holes, holding the lintels in place. And the lintels are perfectly slotted together with what looks exactly like tongue and groove joints. 

Evolutionist:  Ever heard of erosion?  Those Saracen stones are sandstone.  Sandstone can erode in all sorts of interesting ways.  Also, plant roots can make holes in sandstone before it is hard.

Intelligent Design Proponent: That seems ludicrously improbable to me.

Intelligent Design Proponent: Yes.

Evolutionist:  And you know that glacial ice can deposit huge stones in all sorts of odd configurations, right?

Intelligent Design Proponent: Yes.

Evolutionist:  And you know that the forces of nature did in fact deposit stones exactly like Stonehenge’s a bare eighteen miles away from the site, at Marlborough Downs?

Intelligent Design Proponent: Yes.

Evolutionist:  Well, the only difference between those natural formations (on Marlborough Downs) and Stonehenge is one of degree.  Why put arbitrary limits on what nature can accomplish? Obviously, if nature can make Marlborough Downs, it can make Stonehenge.

Intelligent Design Proponent: What about the blue stones?  Those are from Wales.

Evolutionist: The same natural mechanisms can explain their presence. Just another difference in degree.

Intelligent Design Proponent: What about the fact that the stones in Stonehenge are purposefully arranged?  The structure is aligned with sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice. 

Evolutionist:  If I look in my own yard, I can find trees that are aligned with the equinoxes and solstices.  Should I believe they were intentionally planted there for that purpose?

Intelligent Design Proponent (exasperated): Well, what would convince you that Stonehenge was intelligently designed?

##Implications for plant evolution 

What's interesting about this dig is that the root systems of the trees in this ancient forest looks pretty much like modern trees.  That's an issue because we're talking about a time that was supposedly before the evolution of the seed. Ie. These amazing modern root systems supposedly came from plants that reproduced through spores, budding or fission.

Another problem is one that plagues the theory of evoulition every time we look at the fossil record.  Things happen way too quickly to be explained by natural selection and then suddenly stop happening. 

For example the first Vascular plants appeared in the Silurian period which is about 440 million years ago.  By 416 mya we have the first complex vascular plants and first primitive lycopods,  Lycopods.  However even by 390 mya plants according to modern science would be no more than a few centimetres tall. Exceptional species like the Psilophyton could reach 10 centimeters in height according to modern science.  

You can see the problem ight, how do we go from the first vascular plants 440 million years ago to large forests with might roots in a 50 million year period?  If evolution can move that fast, why don't we see these huge differences occurring in plant life from the ecocene (50 million years ago to today) Why these periods of rapid change and then sudden stasis - that doesn't sound like Darwinian evolution at all.  


Further the story emerging vascular plants 440 million years ago to 290 million years ago when plants were thought only a few centimeters high 390 million years ago doesn't comport with a mighty root system that looks like modern forests.

Scientists say the roots in question belonged to the Archaeopteris  which in all aspects looked just like a modern coniferous tree - except it wasn't a modern tree because that would be impossible because modern trees hadn't evolved it.  However it has similar wood to a modern conifer and in there are fossil for supposed Archaeopteris plant, in which it's leaves look just like fir needles - but they're not fir needles becaue again fir needles hadn't developed yet, thus thy must be a type of frond. This tree is said to have  coexisted other exotic and known plants from 380 millions of years ago, including ferns, horsetails, lycophytes, which were only a few centimetre high.  For no reason Archeopeteris evolved to look just like a modern tree, and then died out before modern trees formed.

*Nobody talks so constantly about God as those who insist that there is no God*. ~Heywood Broun

If there was no Creator, human fantasies would be individual imaginations, and easily dismissed. But if there IS a Creator/God, it *could* follow that some, living in denial of this reality, would lash out in hysterical, irrational, hostility.

I observe an outrage.. an irrational hysteria against The Creator, ESPECIALLY, the God of the bible, among militant atheists.  Every forum with a religio/philosophical topic is a magnet for these militant, hostile atheists,  who seem to be on a crusade,  or personal vendetta against God.  They mock, ridicule, and bully those who express any kind of faith in God, which is nothing but religious bigotry.  Reddit is a glaring example of this phenomenon.  Some 'religious' forums have more vocal atheists, constantly expressing their disapproval, disagreement, and hostility toward anything 'God', than the believers.

*The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not.* ~Eric Hoffer

The very presence of this irrational, highly emotional bias against God is evidence of some deep seated issues with the Creator. It is a 'daddy issues!', psychological phenomenon, where unjustified, intense hostility is directed at a Figure who is not the *cause* of the irrational obsession, merely the target.

I see no biological or natural explanation for this phenomenon in humanity, which leaves it as a primal instinct.. a deep seated 'knowing', or at least feeling, that there is a God who can help us, and we involuntarily cry out. This is not a thought out process, but an instinctive response in a crisis. In the deepest recesses of our being, we 'know' that our Creator is there.

I experienced this as a young atheist. I was raised in an irreligious, secular home, where God was not mentioned (except as an epithet!). I became a full fledged atheist, with the corroborating Indoctrination from the State propaganda centers.

I was involved in a crisis, where fire was involved, and instinctively cried out to God, whom i did not know nor believe in. When the crisis abated, i continued in my atheistic beliefs, and remained there for many years.

I have no data, but everyone i have ever known (that has told a tale of crisis), shares this unique human trait.  Crying out to The Creator, in times of emotional,  physical,  or spiritual anguish is the default condition, and is the majority human experience.

**Evidence and System: Two Examples**

&gt; These reports were written by the two field committees: the Historical and Theological Field Committee, composed of faculty members generally opposed to Enns's book, and the Hermeneutics Field Committee, composed of members generally favorable towards Enns's ideas. (Wikipedia article on [Peter Enns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peter_Enns))

When deriving Pr(B) and Pr(N), there are two factors which one should be taking into account: the direct evidence, and the systematic implications. This is true for both science and theology. Consider two examples.

The first example is a theological example about an issue related to Pr(B). Consider these two propositions (note: for the sake of argument, consider them from a *grammatical-literal* reading of the Biblical text - something commonly employed by YECs):

1. Adam was a mythical figure.

2. Adam lived 500,000 years ago.

I propose that (1) is less likely (with respect to our model-fitting) than (2). How is that? First, regarding the evidence, on a grammatical-literal reading of the Bible: both of these statements contradict the direct Biblical evidence surrounding Adam. So, how do we differentiate between the two? Is there even a way to do this? I think that this is where *systematic* considerations come into play. If one is to ""get rid"" of a historical Adam altogether, one must be prepared to remove a central tenet of the Christian system: it has significant impact on numerous other doctrines, including but not limited to hamartiology, Christology, soteriology, eschatology, etc. If one is to ""push back"" the date of the historical Adam, then one need revise much less of her system: in fact, it is difficult for me to pin down just what exactly would need to be revised about Christian doctrine more generally. So, I come out concluding that (2) is more probable than (1), even though both might face textual difficulties.

It is important to note that if one moves away from a strict grammatical-literal reading of the relevant texts, the Biblical evidence might not contradict the statements, or at least might be more plausibly construed as supporting the statements. For example, simply relaxing the completeness restriction on the Genesis 5 and 11 genealogies would allow for any amount of flexibility with regard to how we date Adam. Moving to an existential reading (e.g. Barth) gives us a very different picture of what the Bible is trying to communicate. So, the amount of concordance with ""Biblical evidence"" is itself inescapably tied to the systematic concerns of one's hermeneutics.

Consider another example, this time from science (assume here that we do not mean ""Creation science"" but science in a secular sense):

1. The universe is 6,000 years old.

2. Adam and Eve are the sole progenitors of all human beings.

As in the above case, I propose that (1) is less likely on this account than (2). Again, both of these propositions are in direct contradiction to our ""best"" scientific evidences. But note how much of the grand system of modern science one needs to overturn in order to get (1): geology, astronomy, paleontology, archaeology, etc. Now consider what one would need to revise in order to get (2): basically just population genetics, possibly some archaeological details, and introduce an exception to the evolutionary theory more generally. So, I come away thinking that (2) is more likely than (1), even though both face scientific difficulties, because of the *systematic* implications of one over the other.

In both cases one can think of this as an expression of epistemic humility: which statement would it be less surprising for new evidence to come out supporting? For example, if the work of [Ann Gauger](https://uniqueoriginresearch.org/) holds up to scientific scrutiny, then a major ""scientific"" problem with Adam and Eve as sole progenitors is resolved. On the other hand, I really can't think of a way in which the tide will turn in favor of ""Creation science"" in the YEC sense. Even within Creation science, however, there remain less-difficult and more-difficult problems to solve. One of my YEC friends admits that the speed-of-light problem is more tricky than many of the other ""problems"" with YEC.

**Technical Detail I: Measuring Evidential Support and Systematic Impact**

The question then becomes: how do we measure the impact of system versus evidence? When computing the probability that, e.g., the Biblical evidence comports with a model, a simple metric might be: the ratio of relevant Biblical passages which agree with the model. That gives you a nice number on [0,1] which can be used as a probability. Throw in a Dirichlet prior to prevent probabilities from ever dropping to 0 outright, and you're golden. But what about system?

W.V. Quine talked about knowledge as a web of interconnected beliefs. Within this web, there are beliefs that are more ""central"" in that they support and are supported by numerous other propositions in the web, but there are also beliefs that lie on the boundaries, which might be revised without doing great damage to the system as a whole:

&gt; Certain statements, though about physical objects and not sense experience, seem peculiarly germane to sense experience - and in a selective way: some statements to some experiences, others to others. Such statements, especially germane to particular experiences, I picture as near the periphery. But in this relation of ""germaneness"" I envisage nothing more than a loose association reflecting the relative likelihood, in practice, of our choosing one statement rather than another for revision in the event of recalcitrant experience. For example, we can imagine recalcitrant experiences to which we would surely be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are brick houses on Elm Street, together with related statements on the same topic. We can imagine other recalcitrant experiences to which we would be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are no centaurs, along with kindred statements. A recalcitrant experience can, I have already urged, bc accommodated by any of various alternative re-evaluations in various alternative quarters of the total system; but, in the cases which we are now imagining, our natural tendency to disturb the total system as little as possible would lead us to focus our revisions upon these specific statements concerning brick houses or centaurs. These statements are felt, therefore, to have a sharper empirical reference than highly theoretical statements of physics or logic or ontology. The latter statements may be thought of as relatively centrally located within the total network, meaning merely that little preferential connection with any particular sense data obtrudes itself. (*Two Dogmas of Empiricism*)

If we take (in the idealized sense) this web of beliefs to be an actual graph with edges connecting propositions which provide mutual support to each other, we can also take the ""centrality"" idea literally. There exist many [centrality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Centrality) and [node influence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Node_influence_metric) metrics defined on graphs which might be used to weight the impact of a particular proposition on a given system.

**Technical Detail II: Computing Weighted Likelihoods**

There are many conceivable ways of putting the above proposal into formal terms. Here we will suppose (taking the Biblical case, though there is an analogous case with respect to evidences from nature) that, for a given b representing a particular Biblical evidence that we are testing against a model M with Pr(b | M), there is also a weight W(b) corresponding to the systematic importance of the Biblical evidence. We want to compute the weighted likelihood of M given all Biblical evidence B, L*(M | B) - which stands in for our old Pr(B | M), which would correspond to the unweighted likelihood L(M | B). Here's one way to calculate the weighted likelihood:

&gt; log L*(M|B) = sum{ W(b) log Pr(b|M) } / sum{ W(b) }

Which ""conserves energy"" across all the individual likelihoods while also taking into account the weighted impact of each one. From there we choose the model M which maximizes the log-likelihood log L*(M|B).

**How Literally?**

In both the original proposal and this addendum, I have attempted to provide a very formal - and hence idealized - model for evaluating origins models. This should be accompanied with the caveat that it might not always be realistic for an individual to ""take stock"" of her epistemic situation by performing a comprehensive formal analysis like this. The point is that theoretically, such an epistemic inventory *could be done*, and if it is important enough can be done with any degree of comprehensiveness and specificity. It may be realistic for this kind of work to be done if it is a collective effort by a group of inquirers (or a dedicated and well-documented effort by one person) who make use of modern computational tools. This work has been largely inspired by my background in artificial intelligence and machine learning, where such model-fitting and evaluation given a dataset is routine.",0,1576877087,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/edgb63/weighing_evidence_or_modelfitting_revisited/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ7GBZm087Y

The universe seems to be finely tuned for life according to the video. 

Stanford's philosophy department has an expansive section of the may improbable mathetmatical conditions which allow for life here 

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fine-tuning/

In his video Myer uses the example that conditions must be just right to allow for carbon to form. 

There is a series of mathematical facts about the universe that exist for carbon (necessary for life) to form.  Specifically:

&gt;The decay lifetime of a 8Be nucleus is four orders of magnitude larger than the time for two 4He nuclei (alpha particles) to scatter.
&gt;An excited state of the 12C nucleus exists a little (0.3193 MeV) above the energy level of 8Be + 4He. This is necessary because the ground state of 12C is 7.3367 MeV below the energy of 8Be + 4He. Therefore, a 8Be nucleus and a 4He nucleus cannot reasonably fuse directly into a ground-state 12C nucleus. The excited Hoyle state of 12C is 7.656 MeV above the ground state of 12C. This allows 8Be and 4He to use the kinetic energy of their collision to fuse into the excited 12C, which can then transition to its stable ground state. According to one calculation, the energy level of this excited state must be between about 7.3 and 7.9 MeV to produce sufficient carbon for life to exist, and must be further ""fine-tuned"" to between 7.596 MeV and 7.716 MeV in order to produce the abundant level of 12C observed in nature.[16]
&gt;In the reaction 12C + 4He → 16O, there is an excited state of oxygen which, if it were slightly higher, would provide a resonance and speed up the reaction. In that case, insufficient carbon would exist in nature; almost all of it would have converted to oxygen

## Counterarguments and refustations 

###Multiverse 

The most popular argument against fine tuning is the theory of the multiverse.  Naturalists argue, that perhaps there are billions of other universes that don't have these coincidences  and we jut go lucky enough to be in the right one.  Other than being a gross violation of Okham's Razor, Myer points out that you would have to show a mechanism for the creation of these many universes, and it would be difficult to find one that's not also finely tuned. Multiverse doesn't allow us to 

##Weak Anthropic principle, 

This is the argument that no explanation is needed because if the laws were different we wouldn't exist to wonder about our improbable universe.  This seems unsatisfying because it doesn't address why the universe would be improbable in such a way as to allow for life.  It merely restate the fact that the improbable conditions must exist for us to exist 

##Quantum Cosmology 

Myer admits that there is work being done in quantum cosmology that may be able to answer why our universe is finely tuned and may have caused the big bang. Myers expresses his doubts with this possibility because he says that these equations have an informatin problem where the information has to be inserted by a physicist (an intelligent). 

I'm going to reserve judgment on this possibility, and merely say, whatever future discoveries remain to be made in Quantum Cosmology or the regarding the nature of the multiverse, what is clear is that at the current moment, based on our most current understanding of physics, the only coherent and rational position is that the universe had an intelligent creator.",6,1576802304,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ed2bfh/stephen_meyer_on_the_finely_tuned_universe/
Creation,ecjxgl,37o4,Biblical Inerrantist (Framework View),t2_nr6mc,self.Creation,,A model-fitting solution to the creation/evolution debate,"*The title is optimistic but my goals are much more humble. I've been reading Joshua Swamidass's new book and I've been thinking about how scientists who are also Christians can sort through their own beliefs about which models of cosmic/human history are most convincing, and also potentially make headway in conversations with other Christian scientists. And all this while hopefully leaving some sort of independence between the experimental/historical science and the hermeneutics of Scripture - though this model also helps us understand the potentially helpful and adverse effects of cross-pollination between the two.*

**Introduction**

Science faces anomalies. A good example of this is in the phenomenon we call ""dark matter."" Dark matter is really just a placeholder for a blind-spot in our current cosmology, and a large amount of scientific resources are currently being directed to making sense of it. Biblical hermeneutics also faces anomalies. Article 14 of the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy says, ""We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture. We deny that alleged errors and discrepancies that *have not yet been resolved* vitiate the truth claims of the Bible"" (emphasis mine). Part of an honest Biblical scholar's job is to seek out and resolve the alleged errors and discrepancies that remain in our modern understanding of the text. In fact, it is often by fitting together the anomalies that the science of Biblical hermeneutics moves forward. In my own tradition, the great Reformed Biblical theologians of the last century have done enormous work toward defending the ""unity and internal consistency of Scripture"" by producing better models of what's going on behind the text (so to speak). My goal here is to show how a person who is honestly convinced of the inerrancy of Scripture, and who is also honestly convinced of the methodologies of the natural and historical sciences, can pursue a model of origins which does justice to both and is not overburdened with either anomalies or ad-hoc hypotheses. The enterprise of origins research will likely be a work-in-progress until our Lord comes again, but it behooves us to take it seriously.

**The Independence Thesis**

The first piece of machinery in my model-fitting solution is a thesis of *independence* between the scientific and the Biblical data. It is common in evidential apologetics to use extra-Biblical scientific and historical evidence to ""prove"" that the Bible is correct. Often this happens in a piecewise fashion, for example in Dr. Swamidass's new book: ""Whether or not Adam and Eve were real, there is public and private evidence that Jesus rose from the dead"" (pg. 8). Yet this seems to be turning the Chicago Statement (which Dr. Swamidass affirms (pg. 13)) upside down! If you believe that the Bible is inerrant then you believe that Jesus rose from the dead *because* the Bible proclaims it to you, and likewise *if* the Bible claims that Adam and Eve were real, then you are likewise bound to take that truth seriously. A more subtle example is found in the work of Answers In Genesis, with one of their oft-promoted Ken Ham videos being titled ""Science Confirms the Bible."" At the end of the day, Christians do not live their lives in fear that new science will come out which seriously challenges the truths of Scripture. Why is that? Because their faith does not ultimately rest on science, but rests on something else (for example, the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit).

Turning instead to the traditional ""two books"" idea - that God has provided us with both the ""book of Scripture"" and the ""book of nature"" by which to know him - we have the groundwork for a more productive cooperation between science and Scripture (theology). I propose operationalizing the two books by assuming that they are *conditionally independent* given some model of origins: if N is the set of ""natural"" evidences delivered by our natural and historical sciences, B is the set of ""Biblical"" evidences delivered by our hermeneutics, and M is an origins model (a hypothetical account of *what really happened*), then by our conditional independence assumption:

Pr(B | N, M) = Pr(B | M)

That is, the probability that the Biblical evidence is what it is given the natural evidence and the origins model is the same as the probability that the Biblical evidence is what it is given the origins model. The same is true if you flip B and N. This is the same as saying that the Biblical evidence stands ""come what may"" in the scientific investigation, and likewise that the scientific investigation need not be steered by Biblical exegesis. What this gives us is justification for exploring Biblical hermeneutics without ""fear"" of science, and science without ""fear"" of Biblical hermeneutics. As we will see, it also gives us a way to evaluate an origins model in terms of both our scientific and hermeneutical evaluations without compromising our commitments to either of them.

**Likelihood Tests**

Before we get to that, it is important to clarify the status of the probability Pr(B | M), the probability of the Biblical data given the origins model. Specifically, we should note that it is *not* the same as Pr(M | B), the probability of the origins model given the Biblical data. Of course, Pr(M | B) is a more ""high octane"" quantity, because knowing it would give us good justification to either accept or reject a given origins model given our Biblical data. But Pr(B | M) is a much easier quantity to get ahold of. One other nice property of the quantity is that many different models M' can produce similar probabilities Pr(B | M'), and the sum of all those conditional probabilities can exceed 1. What that means is that two very different models can both yield very high probabilities (say, 0.997) and that's not only okay, it's *expected*.

At the risk of getting ahead of ourselves a bit, let's have an example. Most everyone across all flavors of creationism and secular evolutionism would agree that Pr(B | YEC), where YEC is the Young Earth Creation model, is very high. That is, *if in fact the Earth was created 6,000 years ago, etc., then it is very likely that the Bible would be written the way it is*. There is really nothing controversial about this, no matter what one's position is. So why isn't every Bible believing Christian a Young Earth Creationist? Well, take an Old Earth Creationist who is convinced that the Biblical account is very consistent with an old earth (with whatever specific hermeneutical approach makes him/her happy). The Old Earth Creationist then believes that Pr(B | OEC) is *also* very high, perhaps just as high as Pr(B | YEC)! In this case, there is nothing inconsistent with the Old Earth Creationist's epistemic state, but there needs to be something more that provides the deciding factor.

Enter the idea of likelihood comparison of origins models. By the conditional independence thesis, we can define the *likelihood* L(M) of a particular origins model given data from God's ""two books"" as:

L(M) = Pr(N, B | M) = Pr(N | M) * Pr(B | M)

Here again, L(M) is not a *proper* probability in that it delivers anything proportional to Pr(M | N, B), but the crucial factor here is that *L(M) can be directly compared with L(M') for any two origins models*. The upshot is that, given a zoo of potential origins models delivered by the modern creation/evolution debate, a Christian can evaluate (given his/her own scientific and hermeneutical convictions) the likelihood of every model, and (provisionally) accept the one that comes out on top! If two models seem to match the scientific data very closely, then the theological data will be the deciding factor. Likewise, if two models seem to match the theological data very closely, then the scientific data will be the deciding factor. In no place is the authority of Scripture compromised, and in no place is the practice of science in danger of being twisted because of hasty theological assumptions.

**Model-Fitting**

Now to put the proposal into practice, I will perform an inventory on my own epistemic convictions concerning popular origins models. In the modern discourse, three broadly-construed Christian theories about human origins have emerged within which virtually all the more-specific theories can be classified:

1. Young Earth Creationism: the universe was created around 6-10 thousand years ago, with all humans descended from a single specially-created ancestral couple from about that time.

2. Old Earth Creationism: the universe was created around 13 billion years ago (with precise dating falling into the realm of natural science rather than exegesis), with all humans descended from a single specially-created ancestral couple who were created in the much-more-distant past than 6,000 years (with precise dating again falling into the realm of natural science).

3. Evolutionary Creationism: the universe was created around 13 billion years ago, with all humans descended from an original population of homo sapiens which arose out of providentially-guided evolutionary processes. Adam plays the role of an ancient king with whom God first entered into a covenant relationship.

To these three theories, Dr. Swamidass adds a fourth:

4. Young Adam Creationism: the details of cosmic and human (or at least homo sapiens) history are the same as in the evolutionary case, but with Adam and Eve being late, specially-created, genealogical ancestors of all humans by the time of Jesus's birth whose descendants intermarried with homo sapiens outside the Garden.

I will not go into detail here about my appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and will instead let my likelihoods do the talking. Note in the table below that I do not even use proper probabilities at all - this is simply for convenience and to emphasize the point that what matters at the end of the day is not how high any given model's likelihood is, but rather how its likelihood *compares* to the likelihoods of other models. In this case, a probability of 5 indicates that I believe there are basically no inconsistencies between the data and the model, while a probability of 1 indicates that I believe the data can only be made consistent with the model given a large number of ad-hoc hypotheses.

| Model | Pr(N) | Pr(B) | L(M) |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| YEC | 1 | 5 | 5 |
| OEC | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| EC | 5 | 3 | 15 |
| YAC | 5 | 1 | 5 |

As you can see, when I appraise my own convictions, I find Old Earth Creationism most convincing, with Evolutionary Creationism less convincing but still more convincing than Young Earth Creationism. Dr. Swamidass's proposal, likewise, fails to get off the ground even past Young Earth Creationism - because it seems to me (right now, though I haven't finished the book yet) that he relies on too many ad-hoc hypotheses to fit his model to the Biblical data. That is, *it seems unlikely to me that the Biblical authors would have written what they did if they were trying to convey facts about Dr. Swamidass's genealogical Adam*.

It is, of course, every Christian's prerogative to compute their own likelihoods, but I believe this goes a good ways in progressing the conversation around origins. For example, you can see from my appraisal that I do not reject evolutionary creationism because I have scientific problems with it, but rather because I have hermeneutical problems with it. Likewise, I do not accept old earth creationism because I think it is ""rock solid"" scientifically, but because I believe that it is more likely what Scripture teaches and I am (at present) willing to take the epistemic hit and have a certain number of anomalies in my scientific theories because I believe that there is ""enough"" to gain theologically.

**Cross-Pollination and ""Inversion""**

As a final note, I wish to comment on some problems that arise on both ends of the Christian creation/evolution spectrum due to attempts at ""cross-pollination"" between the science and hermeneutics. On the one end you have the BioLogos folks, who will generally use science to guide their hermeneutics, and will twist the Biblical facts in whatever way necessary to align with the modern evolutionary synthesis. On the other end you have the ""creation science"" and even some ""intelligent design"" folks who are willing to twist the scientific facts in whatever way necessary to align with a certain hermeneutical approach to Scripture. In both of these cases you will likely see an ""inversion"" of the probabilities for either N or B.

While BioLogos people are more likely to discard Pr(B | M) entirely, this is more true in the case of many YECs and ID proponents who I fear are tempted to say that Pr(N | M) is very *low* for the evolutionary models. But this seems to me to be fallacious reasoning. Just because one believes that the Pr(Evolution) is low doesn't mean that one thinks that Pr(N | Evolution) is low. In fact, Pr(Evolution) could be close to 0 (as it is for many YECs), but even in that case I see no reason at all to object to the idea that Pr(N | Evolution) is very close to 1! This seems to be a corollary of the fact that Pr(B | YEC) is very high for most everyone. Because YEC is a model that is produced first and foremost by exegesis of Scripture, it is only natural that Pr(B | YEC) is high. Likewise, because evolution is a model that is produced first and foremost by scientific investigation, it is only natural that Pr(N | Evolution) is high. This doesn't mean that Pr(N | YEC) cannot *also* be high, if one accepts the tenets of creation science. Note in this case that what will happen is that Pr(N) will be relatively high for most models on the board, but Pr(B) will be high only for YEC. This, I believe, is the recipe for a more honest form of YEC. But I will concede that there are some people who have legitimate, independently-arrived-at problems with the evolutionary theory from the perspective of empirical science. Only in this case is such an inversion of Pr(N) in turn made legitimate, because the independence assumption is not violated.",32,1576708875,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ecjxgl/a_modelfitting_solution_to_the_creationevolution/

##Study Background   


&gt;The DDD study was carried out by researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, U.K., and it was co-led by Dr. Matthew Hurles and Jeremy McRae. 

&gt;The research involved the exome sequencing of 4,293 families that had at least one member with a severe but undiagnosed developmental disorder. 

&gt;[Exome sequencing](https://www.nisc.nih.gov/docs/FAQ_whole_exome.pdf) is a common and effective way of selectively sequencing the protein-coding regions of the DNA in order to discover genetic variations associated with disorders  


##Methodology 

&gt;In the sequencing for this study, the team focused on spontaneously arising mutations that occur when the DNA is passed on from parents to children. These mutations - also called [de novo](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/genetics-dictionary?cdrid=460142) or new mutations - are not present in either parent, but appear for the first time in one family member. This is as a result of a variant in the sperm or egg of the parent, or in the fertilized egg itself. 

&gt;The children in the DDD study were also clinically assessed. Researchers then combined the clinical data with previous analyses of another 3,287 people living with similar disorders.   


##Findings 

&gt;Overall, depending on the age of the parents, the team report that between 1 in 213 and 1 in 448 children are affected by new mutation-induced developmental disorders. Worldwide, this means that almost 400,000 newly born children are affected by spontaneous mutations.   


##Creation Implications   


So we know that between 1 in 213 and in 448 children are affected by new mutations that cause developmental disorders.  Can we use that number to calculate how many generations it would take for the human species to no longer be viable and suffer error catastrophe based on a detrimental mutation rate of 1 in 200",27,1576632790,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ec5l3w/genetic_entropy_large_scale_uk_study_finds_that/

Creation,ebnq8p,vivek_david_law,,t2_526vfq87,self.Creation,,Problems with dating,"Background about me,  I think I occupy a unique position in creationist circles because I'm a fairly devout Catholic.  Thus I not only belong to a church that officially encourages evolution, but YEC type views are openly discouraged by most Catholics.  

My issues with the current scientific view is not religious, I just think it's bad science - Darwinism did terrible at predicting the fossil record and the scientific basis for our understanding of the natural world is so poor as to be laughable.  Darwinism and natural history occupy the place that phlogiston or Aristotelian physics occupied in the Victorian era, no longer viable in terms of available evidence.  

So with that I wanted to go over dating methods because this is one of the huge problems with the mainstream scientific view that I don't think gets enough attention.  Popular notions of dating imagine radiometric dating as akin to looking at a thermometer. People seem to imagine we have access to star trek type scanners that we can just run over a fossil and instantly tell the date.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In many cases, the truth is we have no means of directly dating fossils or rocks.  In the limited cases where we can date, the methods we have are highly imperfect and subject to error. 

##Radio metric dating 

Radio metric dating is the most popularly known type of dating. We believe we know the half life of radioactive isotopes and so we guess how old a sample is by look at the rate of decay.

##Radio Carbon Dating 

Radio Carbon dating, which is often brought up in terms of dating fossils is actually irrelevant in dating fossils. Radio Carbon dating only works for stuff that is 50 000 years old or less. Radio carbon dating looks at the rate of decay of carbon 14 in formerly living things to guess the age. 

Radio Carbon dating is also made inaccurate by exposure to humidity and ocean water (as in flood - or just normal water that is abundant on this planet). It also assumes that Carbon 14 was constant in the atmosphere throughout earths history.  Which is wrong it wasn't. 

Carbon 14 is continually formed when nitrogen atoms of the upper atmosphere collide with neutrons produced by the interaction of high-energy cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Think about that, the earth isn't in stasis, it goes around the milky way every 250 million years - 125 million years ago our planet would have been on the other side of the galaxy, is the number and type of cosmic rays going to be constant or any way predictable throughout that journey? As are nitrogen levels.  

Scientists claim that we calibrate radio carbon dates to account for these variables.  The claim that we do this based on other known samples.  Most radio carbon is calibrated using dendrochronology (looking at tree rings)  ""Calibration"" in this context is basically an admission that carbon dating doesn't give the accurate date for known things and so we have to adjust the radio carbon dates. Dendrochronology is only goes back reliably to about 6 - 7 years with the oldest claims going back 12 000 years (but those are less reliable).  

So here's what happened - we have tree ring samples that go back 6 - 7 000 year (possibly 12 000 years) we tried to compare them to radio carbon dates - and found they didn't match at all.  So instead of admitting that radio carbon is not a good way to get dates, we claim to have calibrated and adjusted radio carbon based on the tree rings  - what happens when we don't have tree rings to ""calibrate"" - well we can only assume the dates are even more off. 

The next most popular method of dating is potassium argon dating which is used on crystals.  This method measures the decay of potassium 40 into argon. The problem with this method of dating is that argon is present in the atmosphere - which means that it is almost impossible to prevent the sample from being contaminated.  It also assumes - improbably that there was no contamination for the millions of years that the sample was in the ground and not exposed to heat and pressure - which is hard because if it's in a place that's forming crystals - it was probably exposed to heat and pressure.

The next popular method of radio-dating is uranium-lead dating - which only works on volcanic rock or rock that has been exposed to heat.  It measures the decay of uranium into lead.  It also assumes that none of the lead leaked out was lost - over the 70 million to 4 billion year range period that this technique is used for.  

Both Uranium and potassium dating assume that the daughter isotope (lead or argon) started off at 0 and the parent isotope decayed to form the entirety of the daughter.  This is wrong - there were probably trace ammounts of lead or argon already present or at least exposed during the long period under ground, and trace amounts is all you need to throw off the sample.  

Also, notice that radio carbon was inaccurate when compared to known samples - well in the case of Uranium and potassium based dating - we don't haven known samples between 70 to 4 billion years old, we have best guesses and so can't even verify or calibrate.  But if radio carbon was inaccurate based on unknown factors, why should potassium argon or uranium lead be accurate just because. 

A problem common to all radio metric dating is the assumption that the decay rates of isotopes was constant - for the last 50 000 to 4 billion years. Which we know is wrong because we know at the very least decay rates fluctuate with relation to the position of the sun (and probably other factors)


So in conclusion 
1. We don't have any reliable way to date samples older than 6-7 years old (possibly 12000 based on tree ring data)

2. We can't directly date dinosaurs and there are only very few things we can even date - it has to be the right isotopes 

3. even with stuff we can date, there's no way to check for or prevent contamination, 

4. even if we can prevent contamination, we know that radioactive decay isn't actually constant over long periods of time it is affected by various factors including the suns position and likely others we don't even understand yet 

As a side note, if we could date dinosaurs, through radiocarbon dating, that would greatly undercut the basis of current scientific view that they are a millions of years old.  Well it's happened.  The scientist that did it had to lie to get the samples because god forbid we do experiments that might undercut our world view.  Once the samples were dated, through radio carbon (Which would show the samples are much younger than millions of years - the instant response was contamination - even where the same precautions were used as in ordinary scientific research) see here

*""The rich fossil record of the family Equidae (Mammalia: Perissodactyla) over the past 55 MY has made it an icon for the patterns and processes of macroevolution. Despite this, many aspects of equid phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy remain unresolved. Recent genetic analyses of extinct equids have revealed unexpected evolutionary patterns and **a need for major revisions at the generic, subgeneric, and species levels**. To investigate this issue we examine 35 ancient equid specimens from four geographic regions (South America, Europe, Southwest Asia, and South Africa), of which 22 delivered 87–688 bp of reproducible aDNA mitochondrial sequence. **Phylogenetic analyses support a major revision of the recent evolutionary history of equids** and reveal two new species, a South American hippidion and a descendant of a basal lineage potentially related to Middle Pleistocene equids. Sequences from specimens assigned to the giant extinct Cape zebra, Equus capensis, formed a separate clade within the modern plain zebra species, a phenotypicically plastic group that also included the extinct quagga. In addition, we revise the currently recognized extinction times for two hemione-related equid groups. However, it is apparent that **the current dataset cannot solve all of the taxonomic and phylogenetic questions relevant to the evolution of Equus**. In light of these findings, we propose a rapid DNA barcoding approach to evaluate the taxonomic status of the many Late Pleistocene fossil Equidae species that have been described from purely morphological analyses.""*

I am ignoring many of the assumptions of time, macroevolution, &amp; other unsupported assertions in this study, &amp; will focus on the facts.

**many aspects of equid phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy remain unresolved. **
That should be obvious. the former definitions, based on 'looks like!' morphologies are debunked by the hard evidence of genetic lineage. The former lines of equus, popularized in textbooks, nature shows,  scifi movies,&amp; slideshows have been pretty much debunked by genetic science.

a need for major revisions at the generic, subgeneric, and species levels. **
Clearly. Simply relying on 'looks like' homologies for taxonomic classifications won't do it, anymore. We have hard data, now,  &amp; lines that can be followed in the mtDNA.

Our former beliefs about equus are not accurate. Genetic research has shot some holes in the commonly held beliefs about equus &amp; equidae.

What the study found is hard data linking the various equus clades  with  those currently alive. The old world asses &amp; horses are clearly related to the new world ones. Even though there has been some genetic drift, &amp; narrowing of the traits available to the particular clades, even to the point of near reproductive isolation, the descendancy is evident.

Most of us learned from school, or other Common Ancestry indoctrination centers, that equus started small, like a rodent, then 'Grew!' into the larger horse.  We had a 'Walk of Evolution!' graphic, like with man.

*The original linear model of gradual modification of fox-sized animals (Hyracothere horses) to the modern forms has been replaced by a more complex tree, showing periods of explosive diversification and branch extinctions*

The 'updated' knowledge about equus is not based on imagined sequences, of purely 'looks like!' descendancy, but has the genetic basis for a family or genus based classification. A circular hub &amp; expanding branches, are a more accurate reflection of the 'branching out' of equus (and other phylogenetic structures) even though the older notions are still promoted as 'settled science!' by many in the CA indoctrination camp. The earlier belief was a line of evolution, starting with smaller, simpler strains, then getting bigger &amp; more complex. But this is not indicated by the DNA. Many of the formerly held 'ancestors' of equus have been discovered to be not related at all. The imagined sequence of 'evolution!' is only that: Imagined. 

There is a central, Nuclear genetic type that all other equids come from. They then branch out, diversifying in regions, ecosystems, &amp; climate. But as far as the original ancestor of equidae, not much is known. We can follow the diverse line, but any speculation about the origin of the original equid is just speculation. Here are some key points about equidae:

All equids are from an original ancestor. They did not originate distinctly from different parent genotypes.

Equids should ONLY be classified as equids if they can be evidenced to be part of this genetic haplogroup... that is, if we can trace the mtDNA to indicate descendancy. Big dogs, or other 'looks like a horse!' morphological taxonomies should be discarded in favor of the harder science of actual descent.

Some equids have changed their chromosome numbers, but still can reproduce.. sort of. A donkey with 62 chromosomes can mate with a horse with 64, but produce a sterile mule. Reproductive isolation has occurred,  in some clades, but the descendancy is still evident. 

However, not all odd chromosome matings result in infertile offspring. So there is something else going on to cause reproductive isolation. 

Note in the wiki list below that a fox &amp; skunk have the same chromosome count as the horse, but that does not indicate descendancy. The donkey &amp; horse, though, even with different chromosome pairs, have clear evidence of descendancy. IOW, the number of chromosomes is NOT an indicator for evolution or descendancy. It is the MAKEUP of the chromosome that indicates it. The haplotypes that have the same kinds of genes, *structure,* &amp; functionality are the indicators, not the number of chromosomes.

As a reminder, genes, dna, &amp; chromosomes are not like lego blocks, randomly put together in different strands, to make different organisms. Each strand of DNA is unique to the clade it comes from, &amp; can only generate others in the same clade. They can branch out to form narrower subsets of the clade, but they are all descended from the same parent stock.

It is possible (and seems supported by the genetic evidence), that at some time the donkey with its 31 pairs of chromosomes branched off from the horse with its 32 pairs. Chromosomes CAN split &amp; join at the telomere level, but descendancy is still seen in the structure of the 'arm' of the chromosome, and more preciselyin the mtDNA.  Even though there has been some splitting or joining of a chromosome, the basic structure has not changed.. only the length of the telomere, as it has fused or split from the original. All the other genetic information, genes, &amp; structure are the same.. just the connections along the telomere have varied.

Here are some chromosome pair numbers from wiki:
Fennec fox Animals Vulpes zerda 64
Horse Animals Equus ferus caballus 64
Spotted skunk  Animals Spilogale x 64
Mule  Animals 63 semi-infertile
Donkey Animals Equus africanus asinus 62

In the study, they even got a few sequences from extinct clades. But they are all descended from the same parent haplotype, &amp; their relation is evident. 

Another interesting point of the study:
*""at the molecular level, aDNA studies on a wide range of large mammal taxa have revealed that the loss of genetic diversity over this time period has been much larger than previously recognized""*

How is it, that long ago, there was more diversity than now, if the assumption of common ancestry is that new genetic information is constantly being 'created'?  Why was there 'all this diversity!' early in the history of equus, but now we observe LOW LEVELS of diversity in each of the equus clades?  This is contrary and in conflict with the predictions of the common ancestry model, which posits increasing complexity and diversity, in all haplogroups. 

Equus, and the genetic lineage revealed through it, fits perfectly in the creation model,  but conflicts in almost every way with the common ancestry model.  Equus ancestors appear abruptly, with no evidence of descent from 'something else!', and branched out in its phylogenetic tree from EXISTING genetic information,  already present in the ancestral equid.  As each clade branched out, lower levels of diversity are observed, not increasing complexity. *Genetic entropy* is driving each clade into dead ends, as they isolate themselves in homogeneity. Some have even gone extinct, and the traits and genes that defined them are lost.  Entropy and DECREASED variability,  is what we observe, in equus (and other phylogenetic structures), not increasing complexity and macro evolution into 'new!' genetic structures.",4,1576503965,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ebfbp4/evidence_for_the_creator_horsing_around_with_equus/

Even mainstream science accepts that we see geological eras in the fossil record.  We see eras like the carboniferous or Jurassic which were long periods lasting 10s of millions of years of relative stability and little change followed by large changes that occured very quickly.  This is nothing like the gradual change through natural selection proposed by Darwinism.   The essence of Darwinism is gradualism which is is completely opposed to the long periods of stability with periods of upheaval and rapid change that we see in the fossil record.     


There is also the issue of what giant plant eating dinosaurs could have eaten to sustain themselves.  Modern science envisions giant sauropods existing during the  Triassic and Jurassic eras.  But the problem is hardwoods and angiosperms (modern flowering planets) were thought not to have evolved yet.  Forests of that time were thought to have been dominated by confers, cycads and ferns.  But it's questionable how large plant eating dinos could have survived on conifers and cycads.  Could primitive plants really sustain large sauropods?   Especially given that these are much less nutritious than modern plants.    


There's a reason that there are few animals today that subsist on conifers and ginkgos, these plants are much lower in nutrition and harder to digest than modern plants.  It's hard to imagine that these same plants were also the mainstay of walking land giants",15,1576475026,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ebaytb/problems_even_accepting_old_earth_view_geological/
Creation,eayx83,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,reproduction questions and thoughts,"I just watched a couple of CrashCourse [videos about human fertilization and reproduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsSbZ85yiQ) and (like everything else in biology) it's far far more complicated than I thought. The cycle of hormones required for ovulation, implantation and development of the fetus is very complicated and relies on hormones produced by pituitary gland, ovary,  placenta,  corpus luteum, blastocyst. There seem to be about 10 different hormones, all of which have to be at varying concentrations at varying times in order for everything to work right, for pregnancy and childbirth to be successful.

Mammals are the only creatures with a placenta or implantation and gestation in the uterus. Birds and reptiles have internal fertilization and their ""uterus"" is basically a shell gland that applies the shell to the egg.  I wonder how evolution explains all this ... no, actually I don't.  It's all just hypothetical small changes applied on top of each other, most of them beneficial and none of them harmful. Of course, we don't know what the sequence of small changes is nor do we have an evidence that they occurred, but hey, that's evolution.  They also throw in ""by-product"" when things get really hard to explain: "" menstruation probably developed as a **byproduct** of increased cellular changes in the endometrium"". Ha.

Evolutionists argue that saying complexity is a problem for evolution is simply a god-of-the-gaps argument. ""This is so complex that it could never have evolved"". They believe that in the future people will come up with theories how various complex structures could evolve. This leads me to two other questions: (1) what do evolutionists do when they come to something so complex that it can't have evolved in simple steps, something like the first cell or a flipped retina, and (2) how complex would something have to be for evolutionists to begin to doubt that the process of evolution could create it?  I really don't think that they are looking at this flip side of the ""god of the gaps"" argument. I don't think that they believe that there is any limit to the complexity of biological structures and organs that evolution can create. This seems to me to be a very unscientific approach, rather it's a rigid belief system that can never be questioned and it results in the insane belief that evolution can do anything, just give it enough time and harness the parallel processing power of large populations.",17,1576416411,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eayx83/reproduction_questions_and_thoughts/
Creation,eay3kw,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for the Creator: Delusion,"This is not so much evidence FOR a Creator,  but the philosophical implications of belief, and the subsequent conclusions, that go with any belief.  It is a response to the typical charge,  *Creationists are all deluded, unable to face life without God!'*

There are 2 basic, mutually exclusive possibilities, for the origin of life and the universe:

*Intelligent Design*

*Atheistic Naturalism*

or more colorfully, 

**Goddidit, or 
Nuthindidit**

All other Questions in life hinge on the *assumption* of one or the other of these base worldviews.

I have listed the Big Questions of life before, but to provide a more complete philosophical overview, I'll repeat them:

*Origins
Meaning
Morality
Destiny*

These are The Big Ones: How, Why, What, &amp; When.
They are questions of matter, purpose, law, &amp; time.

HOW did i (and everybody else) get here?

WHY are we here? Is there a purpose to our existence?

WHAT do we do? Are there rules for our existence?

WHEN we die, what happens? Is there a soul?

The conclusions drawn, from either assumption, are completely different:

IF.. the God made assumption is true, THEN:

How? - Goddidit
Why? - There may be a reason or purpose that God has made us.
What? - There may be rules, or standards of morality, for our behavior.
When? - We might have a soul, and face an eternal destiny.

IF.. we assume a godless universe, the answers are logically different.

How? - Nuthindidit. Natural processes, without intelligent intervention.
Why? - No purpose or meaning is possible. We are a random accident in a meaningless, purposeless universe
What? - No absolute morality is possible. Good, evil, virtue, and morality are human constructs made up to manipulate people 
When? - No soul, no existence beyond the physical.

These are the logical possibilities, and the conclusions, from either assumption.

*Why do so many people believe in a standard of morality, or a sense of significance and purpose, or a feeling of spirit/soul within them?*

2 possibilities:

*- Those things are real, inherent to our existence*

*- those things are delusions*

The dilemma we humans have, is figuring which assumption to believe. Is the universe purposeful, directed, with eternal significance and consequence? Or is it a random accident of nature, with no direction, significance, or consequence?  Is there anything sensory to enlighten us in this most serious of personal quest?

Delusion is common, in the human experience. How does one arrive at an objective, empirical conclusion, on this most basic question of humanity?

How would one distinguish from a genuine 'experience' of God, vs a sentimental feeling, or angst driven psychosis?

What if this 'feeling' of 'More'.. longing, remorse, and emptiness.. is just a chemical reaction in the brain, with no spiritual significance? What if a 'religious experience', is just a delusion, as many skeptics claim?

It seems that if you ignore these 'callings' from God, or at least the feelings of Something More, eventually they go away, and you become settled and convinced they are all contrived.. from fear, wishful thinking, or manipulation.

The problem i have with this conclusion, is the exclusion of themselves, by the skeptics, of the psychological motivations.

IF.. belief in God is a delusion.. wishful thinking to pretend significance and eternal purpose in a meaningless, insignificant universe, how do they exclude themselves? If there is such a major propensity in humanity to believe in a delusion, might the skeptic also be deluded, by pretending there is no God, no accountability, no sin, and no eternal consequence for their words, thoughts, and actions? What if constant denial and 'hardening the heart', toward spiritual matters only dulls or deadens the spiritual perceptors in every human? That possibility is equally valid.

If it an easy projection on the majority to assume, 'delusion!', for believing in God, i submit that the reverse is an equally valid assumption. The skeptic is merely responding from fear and wishful thinking, pretending there is no God, so as to avoid the responsibility and accountability he might have, toward his Creator.

If delusion is as widespread as it appears, then what else can you conclude, but widespread delusion, regarding the mysteries of life?",17,1576410559,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eay3kw/evidence_for_the_creator_delusion/

Creation,eal2qm,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,The Bully Pulpit of Atheistic Naturalism,"I posted this in another subreddit,  but thought the members here might enjoy considering the points therein.   I have edited and formatted it for better readability. 

There exists a Reality:

*The universe was made by a Creator: Intelligent Design. 

The universe is godless, and came about by natural processes.*

These are 2 opposing models, that we can plug the facts into, to see which fits better. I have reduced this simple dichotomy to bumper sticker slogans:

**Goddidit!

Nuthindidit!**

The search to discover this Reality is a combination of both science and philosophy/religion.

Science is an examination of facts that can be placed into either model. Philosophy is an extrapolation of Reason and Abstract concepts that science cannot address. Einstein summed this up nicely in his quote,

"".there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.""* ~Albert Einstein

**Belief**

There are beliefs, opinions, speculations, or surmises about this Reality, but there is not a unanimous opinion on it. It remains, objectively, a religio/philosophical belief. There are levels of dogmatism or certainty in each individual, but the simple fact is we do not have enough information in our empirical data base to declare one belief as 'Absolute Truth.' They remain, at their core, beliefs about the nature of the universe.

**The Narrative:**

*'Creation is religion! Atheism is science!'*

..this is the false narrative that is promoted in all progressive institutions. These institutions have constructed a Bully Pulpit, to relegate any consideration of a Creator to 'religion!', while any atheistic beliefs on origins are labeled, 'Science!' It is effectively assigning the concept of a Creator as myth, while promoting atheistic naturalism as 'Settled Science!'

**History**

For millennia, the consensus from people of science was that of a Creator. It was taught in schools, universities, and was the basis for the scientific revolution a few centuries back. 'To see what God hath wrought', was the motivation for understanding the world we are in, and a belief in a Creator was never a conflict, for the giants whose shoulders we stand on. The majority of all significant (and insignificant!) scientific discoveries were by creationists.

In the mid 1800s, the combined ideologies of Marx and Darwin gave rebirth to atheistic naturalism, which became the cornerstone for humanism and the progressive worldview.

Through the mid 20th century, the concept of a Creator was still taught in most schools and universities. But Progressivism gained control of the judicial system, and began to ban any concept of a Creator as 'religious instruction!', while atheistic naturalism was labelled 'Science!' These were not scientists, but lawyers and activist judges, promoting THEIR philosophical beliefs, and censoring the competition. It is, in essence, religious bigotry, and is using the power of govt to establish a religious opinion, about the nature of the universe. By the 21st century, any reference to a Creator was banned, and only the belief in atheistic naturalism was allowed to be taught.

**Indoctrination**

This religio/philosophical belief on origins is the Official State Belief, and is EXCLUSIVELY taught as 'settled science!' in all progressive run institutions. The media, academia, government, entertainment, and most religious denominations teach exclusively an atheistic naturalism model of origins, even if they allow some distant, obscure Deity for sentimental reasons. National parks, public television, children's shows, sitcoms, comedians, and every progressive institution is complicit with a uniform, constant, and unrelenting propaganda drum, with no questioning, examination of facts, or dissension allowed. Those who question the science or facts that support this model are quickly labeled 'science haters!', 'Deniers!', or other such scientific terms of endearment.

Open forums are trending away from open examination of this subject, in favor of the Narrative. I see examples of this trend to censorship constantly in the public discourse. It is a testament to the effectiveness of progressive Indoctrination. For example, i have posted this treatise in other forums and subreddits. Several closed the thread, or censured me for posting. Why? This is an observation and opinion, about the current climate.

Creation,eak331,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Human consensus,"Truth is not a democratic process. Truth is true, whether we believe it, know it, understand it, or not. But in the sphere of the human experience, a belief in a spiritual, metaphysical realm is a constant, across lines of time, region, culture, race, and religion. There may be different perceptions, as described by the old Hindu tale, 'The Blind Men and the Elephant,' but the reality of the Elephant is not in question.

For all of human history, there are too many instances of interaction with a spiritual dimension to dismiss. People from every time and region have testified to an encounter with 'something,' whether they defined it dogmatically or not.

I have no statistics, but i observe, that even in communist countries, where atheism was the mandated worldview, and theists subjected to re-education and persecution, belief in a Supreme Being was still prevalent. Even now, after DECADES of mandated belief in atheistic naturalism, people in communist countries are embracing a God, as the Source of all things.  They seem to 'feel it', in their innermost being. Every major culture has acknowledged some kind of Divine, Spiritual Entity, or dimension, with a soul that lives on after death, morality, and sometimes accountability for 'bad' actions.

The more successful cultures had clearly defined Deity(s), with moral standards, and acknowledged Him/Them in their daily lives. The only historical atheistic cultures i know of were the communist ones of the last century, and they were short lived. It seems that indoctrinating people to believe in random chance and godlessness isn't as effective as indoctrinating them into a Deity based worldview.

That will spell the end for the current progressive Indoctrination, too.. imo. But like other collectivist fantasies and utopias, previous failures won't deter them.. 'We'll get it right, this time!'  ;)

So, along with the consensus of humanity as 'evidence' of a Supreme Being, i submit the efficacy and success of societies that acknowledge the Creator as evidence FOR a Creator.",6,1576332323,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eak331/evidence_for_the_creator_human_consensus/

Creation,e9mdo4,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Mitochondrial DNA,"This article is about mitochondrial DNA, and the discovery some years back that it was passed down from mother to daughter, tracing actual descent. It leads to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA), in genetic lines, and provides hard science for timelines, descent, and relationships.

From wiki:
""*In human genetics, the Mitochondrial Eve (also mt-Eve, mt-MRCA) is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans, i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on **one woman.**""*

It is a problem for the theory of common descent, as it clearly shows the lines of descent in a particular genetic haplogroup.

For example, we can trace the descendancy in canids.. dogs, wolves, coyotes.. even though they have some differences morphologically, they show matrilineal evidence of descent, and share a common mother.. the Most Recent Common Ancestor that they ALL descended from.

This does not cross over to other speculated ancestors. Humans, for example, share a common MRCA, which shows we all descended from the same mother, and did not evolve seperately, in different geological regions, as was once proposed. Neanderthals were human. Pygmies, Mongols, Eskimos, Europeans, Africans.. every race, region and body type of human beings all share the MRCA.. showing descendancy and relationship with all other humans. Chimps, monkeys, apes, or any other speculated 'cousins', do not have this HUMAN MRCA indicator, but their own, showing *their* lines of descent.

So, while the dingo, dog, wolf and coyote can be traced to a MRCA, humans, apes, and monkeys cannot. Each genetic haplogroup has its own MRCA, and they do not intersect or overlap. There is no evidence of descent.

From wiki:
*Mitochondrial DNA is the small circular chromosome found inside mitochondria. These organelles found in cells have often been called the powerhouse of the cell. The mitochondria, and thus mitochondrial DNA, are passed almost exclusively from mother to offspring through the egg cell.
...
Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by electron microscopy as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria, and by Ellen Haslbrunner, Hans Tuppy and Gottfried Schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.*

**Time to most recent common ancestor, aka 'mitochondrial clock'.**

Source:
News this Week | Science

From the study:
""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate.
For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new clock, **she would be a mere 6000 years old.**
...
The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on **estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor**, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..*

..aka, circular reasoning.. you presume the descendancy of apes and humans, THEN calculate a 'rate!'. It is convenient if the data fits within (and is based upon) the preconceived assumptions.

""*The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were **“stunned”** to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled*..""

So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the status quo dogma.

Mitochondrial DNA carries a genetic indicator of matrilineal descent, and can trace that descendancy all the way back, to a Most Recent Common Ancestor.. the mt-MRCA. It is ONLY passed on by FEMALES.. mother to daughter. The males get it from their mother, but it stops there. Only the DAUGHTER can pass it on.

For this reason, the mt-MRCA has been called 'mitochondrial eve,' ..not because the crafters of the phrase believe in the Genesis account of human origins, but as a cultural reference in western civilization. Most people in western civilization catch the reference to a single 'Mother of all Humanity.' 

The significance of the discovery of the mt-MRCA is often ignored and overlooked:
1. All of humanity, alive and dead, that has testable dna samples, can be traced to this 'mitochondrial eve'. She is the only, single human ancestor we can identify, and all of us descended from her.
2. Neanderthal, Pygmies, Eskimos, Norwegians, Aborigines.. any and ALL human people groups, alive or dead (with traceable dna), are descended from this mitochondrial eve.
3. This matrilineal  descendancy is present in other organisms, and THEIR ancestral lineage can also be traced. Canids, felids, equids, etc, all  have clear lines of descent, from the original mt-MRCA, in their respective haplogroup/clade/phylogenetic type.
4. This mitochondrial 'marker' does NOT cross genetic boundaries, but is exclusive to the particular haplogroup/phylogenetic structure. Apes and chimps do not have the human mt-MRCA, nor do humans have any indication of sharing common ancestry with ANY other species/clade/phylogenetic type. Humans are descended from humans. Apes from apes, canids from canids, equids from equids.

The discovery of this matrilineal descendancy in the mtDNA has been a scientific boon. It has refuted many assumptions and beliefs, that are abundant in the theory of universal common ancestry, and are a problem for those who believe this theory.

I predict as more information is discovered, especially in genetics, the theory of common ancestry will join the flat earth, the 4 humours, and spontaneous generation, in the dustbin of debunked scientific theories. It has become a Religious Belief, complete with fanatical True Believers, who defend it with jihadist zeal, but they are unable to debate the science behind their beliefs.

Evidence for The Creator: 

1. Humans (and other genetic clades/haplogroups), appear suddenly, about 6k yrs ago, or so. 
2. Humanity (and other living things) have diversified to the current levels, and some diversity has been lost.
3. There is NO EVIDENCE  of common ancestry,  or any convergence in our dna. Similarity does not equal descent. 
4. Loss of diversity, and DEVOLUTION, is expected in the creation model,  and debunks the common ancestry model.",26,1576150003,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e9mdo4/evidence_for_the_creator_mitochondrial_dna/
Creation,e93h82,eversoap,,t2_4a7ricb4,self.Creation,,Proof of God through consciousness,"Proof of God through consciousness.

First, I will describe two different categories of properties. One an emergent property and the other an activated property. An emergent property is defined as an illusion. It is a something that is only the sum of its parts and nothing more. For example, a shadow does not really exist. We may call something a shadow, but in reality, it is just the absence of light. The properties of a shadow emerge from the properties of the light surrounding it. Every aspect of a shadow can be explained by the physical properties of light. An example of an activated property is fire. One can create fire by rubbing sticks together. However, fire is more than simply just the action of rubbing sticks together. One may be able to predict when the fire will start, what it will look like, when it will burn out, etcetera, based on nothing more than the position and velocity of two sticks. However, no matter how much about fire can be predicted from physical knowledge about two sticks, fire is not simply two sticks rubbing against each other. The stick rubbing activates the creation of fire. 

I will try to clarify a little about these two properties. One may say that all properties are in fact emergent properties that tie back to physical and chemical laws. After all, the fire example is only considered an activated property because fire is a chemical reaction. In this example only the physical variables were referenced. It is true that fire is more than the physical movement of sticks, but when the chemical components of wood and oxygen are introduced then it appears that fire is in fact an emergent property of the sticks rubbing together. This is true and the fire analogy was only for example. When activated properties are mentioned later, they will be mean something that cannot be explained by both physical and chemical laws. Just like fire cannot be explained by only physical laws. 

Next, I will lay out two possibilities for explanations of consciousness, sentience, qualia, etcetera that do not rely on God. First, consciousness is an emergent property that can be explained through physical and chemical properties. And second, consciousness cannot be explained merely by physical and chemical laws, but an unknown force or element could apply consciousness to humans via in a natural and unbiased way that would not imply the existence of God. For each of these propositions I will supply a common thought experiment to counteract them.

First for the proposition that consciousness is an emergent property, I will use the thought experiment called Mary’s room. Imagine there is a genius scientist named Mary that has spent her entire life locked in a room where everything is black and white and there are no mirrors. While inside of this room Mary studies everything there is to no about color. She knows about the refraction of light and which types of materials reflect which types of frequencies. She knows which frequencies correspond to which colors, she knows how the light enters the eye, and how the information is transmitted into the brain. She knows how the information is processed inside of the brain and how the body responds to it. There is nothing about the physical and chemical properties associated with color that Mary does not know. Eventually Mary is released from her room and sees color for the first time. The question is does she learn anything new. Most people would say yes, she does, she learns what the color red, blue, green, etcetera look like. Mary knows all physical and chemical properties of color, yet when she experiences it herself, she learns something new. Thus color can not be explained purely by physical and chemical properties.

One may say that Mary learns something new only because she experiences it through her own eyes. However, it is important to note that this thought experiment does not work for other concepts that are not primary qualia, like say, a car. There is a clear explanatory gap that exists for the primary sensory experiences of humans that does not apply to other objects and concepts. This heavily implies that unlike a computer, or a backpack, human consciousness cannot be explained by physical and chemical properties alone.

Next, for the proposition that consciousness cannot be explained merely by physical and chemical laws, but an unknown force or element could apply consciousness to humans via in a natural and unbiased way that would not imply the existence of God. I will use the thought experiment known as the Chinese room. There is a man who does not speak Chinese inside a room. A Chinese woman outside of the room sends notes written in Chinese through the bottom space underneath the door. The man takes the notes and looks through a massive book. The book references every single possible combination of Chinese characters that could be written on the note as well as every single possible combination of previous conversations. It then lists exactly what write on a note. He then slips the note back underneath the door to continue the conversation with the Chinese women. This room complex that contains the man and the book can accurately carry on a conversation on the level of a human, so should it have conscious thought? The answer to this is no. 

Even though the room can process information, and respond to the external world, it does not contain subjective experience. Consciousness cannot be a separate element that is added to beings that process information because information is not a real thing outside of the human experience in the first place. There is no difference between a rock and a computer. Both are just substances interacting with themselves or not reacting at all. The universe cannot search the world for computation to add consciousness too because computation is not a tangible thing. 

The only way for consciousness to exist is for God to directly give it to human beings.",8,1576046135,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e93h82/proof_of_god_through_consciousness/

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zOxFFiVY1A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zOxFFiVY1A)

The idea is that negative/harmful mutations accumulate over time in the genome of a species.   Our genes accumulate negative mutations and we pass some of those negative mutations to our children who pass it on to their children. The result is that we (and other species) are not evolving we are degrading.  Over time this should cause all species on the planet to devolve and die out. 

As a biblical creationist, I find the idea appealing:  Because it suggests that marrying brothers and sisters like Adam and Eve's children did was plausible back then because there were less errors in the genes.  It also explains the long lifespans of the early world the bible talks about.   


I also looked around and haven't found a legitimate counter-argument for the concept of genetic entropy by proponents of evolution.  But that may just be because this idea doesn't seem very well known or widespread.   


Has anyone run into this concept before?  Can anyone with a background in this field comment on the validity of genetic entropy youtube based lectures.

Creation,e8qwl1,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Canidae,"Since the evolution debate is going to the dogs, and, since many people are dogmatic about it, and, since it is a dog eat dog world, it is only fitting to look at canidae..  ;)

What does man's best friend have to say about creation vs common ancestry?

The observable, repeatable, historical, and scientific evidence within canidae offers compelling evidence for a Creator, and the model of ID  (Intelligent Design), and conflicts with the belief and model of Common Ancestry (CA).  These same arguments and observations are there with felidae, equidae, and other haplotypes with genetic evidence of descent.  Micro evolution variability is clearly evident, within the canid haplogroup, but the leap to Macro evolution, or the belief in common ancestry,  is unwarranted, and is an extrapolation unjustified by the facts.

I read the following study several years ago, and found a wealth of information about canidae.. many old beliefs or assumptions have been corrected by hard genetic evidence. It has interesting facts about canids, &amp; their genetic base.

http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/8/990.full

This is a study by evolutionists, with the assumptions of evolution dispersed throughout. They even quote Darwin! Here is a summary of some of the points, with quotes from the study in italics:

1. The ancestor of wolves, coyotes, dogs, and other canidae is unknown, appears suddenly, and contained all the genetic information for each haplotype. *the origin of the huge morphological diversity that led Darwin to his speculation remains largely unknown*.
2. Most of the variety of dogs are recent developments, less than 200 yrs old. *Recent studies show that the origin of most dog breeds may derive from very recent selective breeding practices and are probably &lt;200 yr old.*
3. Selection acts on EXISTING variability. It is not created on the fly, &amp; is assumed to take tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of years to produce an evolutionary trait such as seen in canidae. *selection acts upon existing variability*
4. ALL of this variability EXISTED in the ancestral wolf/parent, and conflicts with the time frame in the CA model. *It is remarkable that the potential for such large diversification existed in the ancestral wolf population*. This would be expected in the ID model. 
5. The recent time for the variety of dog breeds is incongruent with the assumption of 'millions' or even thousands of years of evolution, to generate such variety. *Furthermore, the time since domestication seems insufficient to generate substantial additional genetic diversity.*

The child branches within canidae show REDUCING variability, as the diverse genetic information became localized in the various haplogroups.

The mtDNA provides clear evidence of the descendancy within canidae. The time frame is incompatible with the CA model, but fits perfectly in the ID model.

From the link:
*""Phylogenetic tree of wolf (W), dog (D), and coyote (C) mtDNA sequences. The tree was constructed using a Bayesian approach. The same topology was obtained with a neighbor-joining approach. Support is indicated at the nodes as percent bootstrap support for 1000 neighbor-joining replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Four clades of dog sequences (I to IV) are indicated as in Vilà et al. (1997). Internal dog branches are marked in orange, and internal wolf branches are marked in light blue. The branch leading to wolf haplotype W1 was basal to the rest of the tree and it was also considered internal. Internal branches that could not be conclusively associated to dogs or to wolves are indicated in discontinuous green.""*

As you can see, the mtDNA shows the ancestral line. The canid ancestor preceded the wolf, the dog, &amp; the coyote, as well as other canidae not listed. All this does is PROVE descendancy, and shows the variability to be INHERENT in the genes. It was not created on the fly, or mutated over millions of years.

Canidae shows diversity and adaptability. There is no evidence they shared ancestry with felids, equids, or any other haplotype. We can follow the MICRO variations within canidae, but there is NOTHING to suggest they were once of a different genetic structure. Canids have always been canids, and always produce canids, though with reduced variability, as we reach the ends of the branches in their haplotree.

Evidence for creation:

1. The ancestral canid (erroneously called wolf, in this study) contained all the variability for canidae we see today.  There is no evidence of traits being 'created' from hypothetical mutation processes.
2. The ancestral canid appears abruptly, full of variety, with no evidence of descent from any other phylogenetic structure.  The ID model would expect this, while the CA model can only speculate about hypothetical 'ancestors!' of canidae, with no evidence.  A belief is proffered with only assertion and assumption.
3. Canidae mtDNA shows descendancy, clearly following the branching out of the canid line, to the current tips of the branches.  Lower levels of diversity are observed, as the tips of the phylogenetic tree is reached.  This observation is compatible with the ID model,  but conflicts with the CA model of constant injecting of new traits.
4. Dating methods are contrived, circularly, to fit the assumptions of CA. There are no credible or sourced facts for the assumptions and assertions of the massive dates asserted in most studies.  Terms like, 'assumed', 'putative', 'from evolutionary theory', and other circular dating methods are used to bluff an appearance of 'settled science!', for the dates projected, but in fact have no empirical basis.

Creation,e8hcng,azusfan,Cosmic Watcher,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Evidence for The Creator: Universal Morality,"IF.. there is a Creator/God, one might expect a Standard.. an innate moral sense.. that transcends time, race, religious beliefs, culture, and region. 

 'Goddidit!', is at least a plausible explanation for the morality we observe in the human animal.

IF.. there is no God, and morality is only a human construct, we would not expect to see a common thread of absolute morality in the human experience. Morality would be arbitrary and local, mandated by the powerful, with only whimsy, expediency, or local pressures to drive them.

*Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place*. ~Frederic Bastiat

The 'need', for human Law is a reflection, imo, of the REALITY of a universal moral code. We recognize, collectively, a moral awareness, define it as 'conscience', and label those who violate it as criminals or sociopaths.

Because human beings do NOT always observe this inner code, we use the force of a collective enforcement agency (Law) to compel compliance, or suffer punishment. We believe everyone knows  better, and knows that antisocial behavior is a violation of conscience, and thus can enforce law as being 'self evident.'  Most 'Law' is merely morality, codified. Some are logistical, for expediency (e.g., traffic laws), but the Important Ones relate to Conscience.

Most of the core laws are directly related to what the Enlightenment philosophers called 'Natural Law'.. a universal, God given set of rights that no one can infringe upon, without violation.

**Life, Liberty, Property**

These are the  3 basic rights, from the Enlightenment. This covers laws of theft, murder, assault, fraud, extortion, and many others. These are the universal, core Standards, that we see in every era, region and culture of human society.

The Declaration of Independence reflected those Enlightenment values, with this simple statement:

*We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government*..

So, the purpose of Government, from the American perspective, is to secure the basic rights of the citizens.. to enact LAWS, that preserve, inviolate, our Natural Rights.

All of this is based on the ASSUMPTION of a God Ordered universe. ..A Creator Who created all men equal, and ENDOWED them with unalienable rights. Make the assumption of a godless universe, and there is no equality, nor inalienable rights. All is based on relativity, expediency, and the whims of those in power.

It would be a massive delusion, to believe in Natural Law, and Absolute morality, (and many other things), in a godless universe.

""Human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine. . . . Far from being rivals or enemies, religion and law are twin sisters, friends, and mutual assistants. Indeed, these two sciences run into each other."" ~James Wilson, Signer of the Constitution, Supreme Court Justice",39,1575931317,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e8hcng/evidence_for_the_creator_universal_morality/

This is not a religious analysis, appealing to texts, religious beliefs or dogma.   This is an examination of reason and scientific evidence of the facts, that imply or suggest a model of creation.

If there is not a Creator, then ALL believers in that are deluded. They are either blind fools, who deny and ignore Reality, or they are willful deceivers, knowingly promoting a lie for some agenda.

But... if the Objective Reality is that there IS a Creator/God, then it is the unbelievers in this reality who are either deluded fools, or deliberate deceivers.

There IS.. an *Objective Reality*, about the nature of the universe. It is either designed and Created by Intelligent Design, or it is a random accident of godless naturalism.

*Believing* in one or the other of these possibilities has no bearing on the ultimate reality. If one believes there is a Creator/God, and there isn't, they are a deluded fool. If one believes there is NOT a Creator/God, and there is, then he is the deluded fool. *There is only ONE, Ultimate, Objective Reality.* Discovering this Truth has been the life pursuit of many humans for thousands of years.

IF.. knowledge is knowable,
THEN.. some might know this truth, while others are ignorant or deceived.

That condition can only be determined if the Ultimate Truth is revealed. Until then, we give opinions and arguments for those opinions. But neither the arguments nor the opinions have any influence on Objective Reality.

Truth is true, whether we know it, believe it, or not.

Neither believing in something nor denying it has any effect on Objective, Absolute Truth.

The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is. ~Winston Churchill

**Human angst**

There is no naturalistic explanation for this. It does not aid in our survival, or improve the species in any way. It is common throughout the human experience, traversing time, race, religion, and culture. It is a gnawing 'something' in man that hints and implies a spiritual connection.

“There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing but only by God the Creator."" ~Blaise Pascal c. 1670

There are 2 possibilities, concerning angst, as there are with everything in this world:

1. Goddidit
2. Nuthindidit

Is it a Real Thing, embedded by God, or it is a human delusion?  A construct for manipulation? 

If Angst, as experienced and defined by philosophers and most humans over the millennia, is REAL, then it has to have a source. Either it was placed there by a Power with ability to do so, or it happened naturally.

I see this angst as the motivation for the pursuit of 'more'. There is a dissatisfaction with life.. our existence.. that we mask with 'more'.

1. Stuff
2. Sex
3. Recognition
4. Validation
5. Money
6. Power
7. Influence
8. Significance

The recurring theme among human gurus, psychologists, self help conferences, and religious institutions is, 'enjoy life &amp; have fun!'  We have to constantly remind ourselves to do that, and not be nagged by the inner desire for more. Yet no matter how we try.. or how we reassure our psyches of the wise and balanced path we have chosen, an undercurrent of desire.. a hole in our souls.. belies our bluff of contentment.

We are not satisfied with meeting our basic needs, but want more.

**We come into the world laden with the weight of an infinite necessity.**

How many of us were raised with this little evolutionary progression chart? The neanderthal was in that sequence. But for years now, the proponents of evolution have been changing their minds. They won't change the cute little evolutionary drawing, since that is canonized into the Religion of Evolution, but they now realize the neanderthals were just humans.. But with no fanfare.. no  corrections..  no revisions..  just sheepishly admitting that the facts do not support their fantasy.

""*..for a long time paleoanthropologists have viewed Neanderthals as too dull and too clumsy to use efficient tools, never mind organize a hunt and divvy up the game. Fact is, this site, along with others across Europe and in Asia, is helping overturn the familiar conception of Neanderthals as dumb brutes. Recent studies suggest they were imaginative enough to carve artful objects and perhaps clever enough to invent a language.

Neanderthals, traditionally designated Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, were not only “human” but also, it turns out, more “modern” than scientists previously allowed. “In the minds of the European anthropologists who first studied them, **Neanderthals were the embodiment of primitive humans, subhumans if you will,**” says Fred H. Smith, a physical anthropologist at LoyolaUniversity in Chicago who has been studying Neanderthal DNA. “They were believed to be scavengers who made primitive tools and were incapable of language or symbolic thought.”Now, he says, researchers believe that Neanderthals “were highly intelligent, able to adapt to a wide variety of ecologicalzones, and capable of developing highly functional tools to help them do so. They were quite accomplished.” *

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/rethinking-neanderthals-83341003/

""*Neanderthals were human. They buried their dead, used tools, had a complex social structure, employed language, and played musical instruments. Neanderthal anatomy differences are extremely minor and can be for the most part explained as a result of a genetically isolated people that lived a rigorous life in a harsh, cold climate.""*

https://www.icr.org/article/neanderthals-are-still-human/

""*This was a problem for those in the evolution field.
“We were suspicious of the result,” Reich says. “We found signals of mixture and **then worked very hard to make them go away.**”
He tried for a year, to no avail. Finally, Reich and his colleagues had no choice but to conclude that Neanderthals had mated with humans. They estimated that the DNA of living Asians and Europeans was (on average) 2.5 percent Neanderthal.""*
source:
https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/interbreeding-with-neanderthals#.Ujg_esash8E

Since drawing about 60% of neanderthal dna, a lot has been discovered about them. They interbred with homo sapiens. Currently,  ~2 Billion people have neanderthal genes in them.. mostly European &amp; Asian. What does this tell us? They were from the same species/haplogroup. Unique phylogenetic  structures, aka, species, cannot interbreed. They were merely a 'tribe' of humans that had unique physical features.. like many tribes today. Their genetic 'line' can be traced. They did not evolve separately, nor were they a distinct hominid species. They just 'looked different' than whatever 'normal', or 'evolved!' homo sapiens looked like.  Is this not just a racist meme from caucasian Europeans? 

So, if the 'experts' were mistaken about Neanderthal, &amp; they were merely humans like pygmies or aborigines, why do they continue to try to prove evolution with debunked 'facts!'? Why do they start at the conclusion, looking for data to prop up their flimsy arguments?

In many of 'science' forums, sites, nature programs, &amp; other evolutionary indoctrination centers, Neanderthal is STILL pitched as an 'ancestor!' of modern human beings.

Almost every time i 'debate' common ancestry, neanderthals are thrust at me as 'proof of evolution!' So the facts have not caught up with the beliefs, or perhaps the beliefs have not caught up with the facts. Much of what is still taught as 'evidence' for the ToE is refuted, yet it still hangs on like it means something. The desperation is great for SOMETHING to base this belief upon. We have no evidence that man has 'evolved' from a common ancestor, or that species have evolved from simple organisms to the complex varieties we see today.

Creation,e6vpia,stcordova,Molecular Bio Physics Research Assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Why is evolutionary theory so believable and captivating? My answer in video and in text,"I was a Christian evolutionist before I became a Christian Creationist.  The idea of life evolving from simple to complex, from good to even better and better had a certain religious appeal to it.  Of course, that was a naive and romanticized view of evolution. When reality hit me in the face I began to see evolutionary theory for what it was -- a theory that didn't agree with facts.

I give a simplistic answer as to why evolutionary theory is so believable and captivating in this podcast:

https://youtu.be/Zc9Vd8RKMas

A more complete answer follows:

The fundamental reason evolutionary theory is believable is the progression of forms from simple to complex in the present day.  On can take a human and find creatures most similar to them (like chimps) and most dis-similar to them like bacteria, and then put the best fitting ""intermediates"" in between.  Isolated genes/proteins also have this progression too as is nicely illustrated by this tree of the cytochrome-c proteins grouped by similarity across species:


https://cdn.britannica.com/s:700x500/03/403-050-F1B9349F/Phylogeny-differences-cytochrome-c-protein-sequence-organisms.jpg

I see patterns like the cytochrome-c pattern when I'm looking at genes/proteins in my gene and protein browsers.  And contrary to the impression you might get from some creationist literature there are a good number of human proteins that are 100% identical to chimp proteins.  And the progression of forms from very different to very similar is real, and superficially one would think (albeit mistakenly) this is proof for the existence of physical transitionals in the past.  I use the term ""physical transitional"" vs. the more correct notion of ""conceptual transitional.""

If one looked ONLY at genes/proteins across species that can be organized in trees like this, but then ignored and dismissed the serious problem of genes and proteins that can be fit into nice tries, one could delude oneself into thinking evolution is an unassailable fact.

But for example, 


&gt;When I ask a evolutionary biologist , ""can you build a tree from which all proteins/genes descend from a common ancestor?"" 

&gt;They respond, ""no.""

&gt;To which I then say, ""so there is no universal ancestor for all genes, the major protein families follow an orchard model not a universal tree."" [btw the orchard model is analogous to created kinds]

&gt;To which they say, ""correct.""

&gt;To which I say,  ""Thank you very much. You just admitted isolated trees are trees in an orchard, not necessarily part of some universal tree.  In fact the universal tree doesn't exist as a matter of principle.  In fact, major protein families look like created kinds which don't have a common ancestor as a matter of principle. ""

Also when I throw diagrams like the following, evolutionists punt, because they know they have a problem, and I not going to let them off the hook in a protracted debate:

https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/16/18/4543/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1

There are even more problems with universal common ancestry that could fill a magnum opus, but I only showed a few of the many problems.

So why did God create the appearance of evolutionary progression and nested-hierarchies?  Here is an answer, it is not necessarily THE answer, but I suspect it has a good chance of being THE answer. 

And the answer is this progression of creatures from dis-similar to very similar helps us understand ourselves.  It's great that we can learn about human biology by studying bacteria, yeast, fruit flies, nematodes, squid, mice, chimpanzees, etc.  They are what are known as Model Organisms:

https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-are-model-organisms

I mean, isn't it better that we can dissect a pig instead of a human?

The gift of God creating creatures like us also hit home when I had to do a report once on nerve channels and I realized the experimental data for my report was achieved by studying the remains of aborted fetuses on sale on the net for $500 a piece.  I was crushed to learn of this.  Isn't it so much better that an animal is sacrificed than an innocent human fetus?  When God tested Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, God provided an animal as a substitute.  Here in the present day we have the gift of animal substitutes and yet instead we sacrifice human fetuses.  Sad!

This theme of substitution is throughout biology where we can learn that we are fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14) without having to kill ourselves and abort innocent humans babies in the process.  God provides a progression of creatures so that we can live and learn of the miracle of life, especially of our life!

That said,  there are also some really cool ways that patterns of similarity and diversity provide an almost magical of way of unlocking biological secrets, and so magical that only God could have created those nested-hierarchical patterns.  However, the details of how we learned of this is only for the ultra-nerds among us:

First problem is having amino acids, the Urey Miller scenarios failed to get some amino acids and besides, it's likely the Earth didn't have an amonia atmosphere as required by Miller.  So, chance is zero in that scenario.

RNA world?  Even evolutionary Koonin estimates we need an infinite number of universes (of which ours is but one) to start life with the RNA world.  If a person wishes to bet his soul on the multiverse he cannot see rather than the Christian God which he cannot see, that is the person's free choice -- but personally I don't like betting my soul on multi-universes.

Amino acid monomers have a hard time spontaneously assembliing into polymers in water because of spontaneous hydrolysis.  So if amino acids are floating around in Darwin's warm little pond, forget about protein-based life forming spontaneously.  Chances are pretty much zero.  Doubt me?  Buy some amino acids from a chemical company, mix in water vigorously and see if life forms...

Now the part about sequencing.  Here's is a crude estimate of how tough it is to form one class of proteins called transmembrane proteins.  Cells are dead without them!!!!  Transmembrane proteins do many things, but one of their tasks is to ensure that only the right things go in and out of the cell.  


I remember debating an evolutionist and he suggested that stuff can just ""leak"" in and out of the cell naturally, and it would still live.  I was tempted to tell him to get some re-education in basic cell biology.

But anyway.  Consider a simple transmembrane protein with about  200 amino acids.  See this 3-minute video to see how the transmembrane protein weaves in and out of the cell membrane:

https://youtu.be/2aguTUg1sJk

See the segments known as transmembrane domains getting stitched through the membrane.  Suppose we have a protein with 7 such domains.  They require what are known as hydrophobic amino acids.  The probability of a random amino acid being hydrophobic is about 50% if all 20 canonical amino acids are equally represented in the pre-biotic soup.  

Each transmembrane segment has 22-25 amino acids.  For the segment to be 100% hydrophobic, the odds of this happening by chance is (1/2)^22 = 1 chance in 4 million, but to have 7 of such segments in one protein the odds are (1/2)^22^7 = 1 chance in 10^46.  Now the odds might not be quite that bad if we assume that the transmembrane segment is slightly less than 100% hydrophobic.  We'd have to use the biniomial distribution to solve such a scenario, but it's doable with a computer.

But one can see from the video, an isolated transmembrane protein won't be much good if there aren't other proteins and machines. For that matter, it's rather absurd to think a cell can live with only 1 transmembrane protein, so the odds of a functioning cell quickly become astronomical if we assume even a few transmembrane proteins.

Finally the calculation doesn't even involve whether we're accouting for the sequence of hydrophobic amino acids themselves.  This will make the problem even MORE remote.

Just for fun here is a 3-minute video of a transmembrane protein called a Potassium Channel:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKNrxTaIlSQ

Ask yourself, how hard would it be for mere mortals to engineers something like this?  Not easy! Then why would we think random chance can build it if even intelligent beings would be challenged to do this!

I stumbled on this quite by accident.  I passed it on to Dr. Sanford and it definitely caught his eye. And he used to be a horticulture biologist.

&gt;A recent paper in nature indicates Grapes have lost 15% of their genes on homologous chromosomes.  I don't know if this is bad, but that percentage seems high to me, and I don't know if that number is increasing with each generation:
https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/news/a-toast-to-the-genetic-diversity-of-grapes-323794

&gt;The team devoted three years of study to what are known as structural variants, or chromosome changes, in the genomes of the Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to determine their genetic similarity. Each of the fruits has about 37,000 genes.

&gt;""Each of us inherits one copy of their gene from their mother and one from their father,"" said Professor Gaut. ""One would assume that the grapes inherit two copies of every gene, too, with one coming from each of their two parents. However, we found there was just one copy, not two, for 15 percent of the genes in Chardonnay, and it was also true of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. Together, that means that grape varieties differ in the presence or absence of thousands of genes.""


The source paper in Nature is recent:

Creation,e63lyr,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,Fallacies of Evolution,"I misposted this in the evolution subreddit, and was roundly chastised for doing so.  I thought it was more appropriate there, than here, as it is not a 'pro creation' thread, but a criticism of common ancestry. But i have edited it, and offer it here for the entertainment of the viewers. 

Here is a list of fallacies for the Theory of Evolution (ToE) as it is commonly taught in schools.

**False Equivalence** 
We can observe simple variability within an organism. Colored moths adapt to changing tree bark. Rabbits adapt to their surroundings. This is an observable, repeatable science, also known as 'micro evolution'. The fallacy is in making an equivalence between minor changes in physical traits, to extrapolating large changes in the genetic structure. That is NOT observed, &amp; cannot be tested. It is a false equivalence, to equate minor changes in micro evolution with the major ones in macro evolution.

**Argument of Authority**
'All really smart people believe in the ToE.' This is not a scientific proof, but an argument of authority, as if truth were a democratic process. Real science must be demonstrated, via the scientific method, not merely declared by elites.

**Bandwagon**
'Everybody believes this!' This is an attempt to prove something by asserting it is common knowledge. It is obviously not true, anyway, as many people do not believe in the ToE, in spite of decades of indoctrination from the educational system, public television, &amp; other institutions intent on promoting this ideology.

**The infinite monkey theorem**
'Given enough time, anything is possible.' is the appeal here. If you have infinite monkeys, typing on infinite typewriters (lets update this to computers!), eventually you would get the works of Shakespeare, etc. This is an appeal to measure the ToE with probability, rather than observable science. We still cannot observe or repeat the basic claims of the ToE, so the belief that anything is possible, given enough time is merely that: A belief.

**Ad Hominem**
This is a favorite on the forums. If you cannot answer someone's arguments, you can still demean them &amp; call them names. It is an attempt to discredit the person, rather than deal with the science or the arguments.

**Argument by Assertion**
 Instead of presenting evidence, assertions are repeated over &amp; over, as if that will make up for the impotence of the arguments.

**Argument from Ignorance**
This is claiming that evolution is true, because it has not been proven false. But the burden of proof is on the claimant, not the skeptic, to prove their claims. ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof"" ~Marcello Truzzi

**Circular Reasoning**
This is the argument that evolution is true, because we see all the variety of living things that have evolved. It is using the assumption of evolution to prove itself. Taxonomic classifications are often used in this manner.  The phylogenetic tree is an example.

**Equivocation**
This is similar to the false equivalence. It is using the term 'evolution' when talking about variability within an organism (micro), &amp; changing the context to macro evolution. It is comparing horizontal diversity in an organism to vertical diversity in the DNA. But one is obviously visible &amp; repeatable, while the other is not.

**Correlation proves Causation**
This attempts to use similarity of appearance (looks like!) as proof of descendancy. But morphological similarity can often display wide divergence in the DNA, with no evidence there was every a convergence.

Common  ancestry has not been demonstrated by scientific methodology, only asserted &amp; claimed. It is, in fact, a belief.. a religious belief in the origins of living things. It is an essential element for a naturalistic view of the universe, &amp; for that reason, it is defended (and promoted) with jihadist zeal. But it is too full of logical &amp; scientific flaws to be called 'science'. It is a philosophical construct, with very shaky foundations. There are too many flaws in the theory of universal common ancestry, regarding dating methods, conjectures about the fossil record, &amp; other conflicts with factual data.

Why are logical fallacies the primary 'arguments' given for the theory of universal common descent, if it is so plainly obvious and 'settled science!', as the True Believers claim?",33,1575484709,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e63lyr/fallacies_of_evolution/

Creation,e5fi5p,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.Creation,,The Central Flaw of Universal Common Ancestry,"

The Theory of universal  common ancestry is widely considered to be a fact, or 'settle science' by many people who are products of the state educational system. Most of our institutions present it as proven fact, such as TV nature shows, national parks, classrooms, movies, &amp; other presumptions of settled science. But it is not. It is merely a theory, &amp; does not really qualify as that.

Evolution has a central flaw. It is contrary to observed reality. The Theory of Evolution is basically a logical problem. It is a False Equivalence. They argue that since living things change within their genetic parameters, that they also change outside of their genetic parameters. Since moths can be different colors, perhaps they can also become a different creature entirely. This concept is repeated over &amp; over ad nauseum, until the concept seems not only plausible, but accepted as proven fact.

The argument for evolution is based on the presumption of INCREMENTAL, cumulative changes, that add up to big ones. But it ignores the HUGE problem of genetic parameters.. the limits upon the changes that can be made.

For example, you can incrementally travel from New York to LA in daily, small steps. Each step you take is cumulative.. it adds up to the goal of the destination. If you just took a few steps a day, it might take years for you to reach your destination. The ToE makes the false equivalence that since organisms can be observed taking 'small steps' in this way, they assume that the big changes are just added up small changes. But the genetic parameters are ignored. If you correlate many small steps in traveling between cities to interstellar travel, your arguments will fail, as the very restrictive limitation of gravity &amp; distance is ignored. You cannot take many small steps to reach the moon.. Gravity will return you to the earth every time, UNLESS there is a mechanism to overcome gravity. DNA allows the horizontal movement, varying traits &amp; 'selecting' those naturally, or by human design. But it does not allow vertical movement. DNA is like gravity. It will return you to the same organism EVERY TIME. That is observable, repeatable science.

The science of breeding or natural selection conflicts with the ToE. You do not observe increasing traits being available for organisms, but DECREASING. That is how you 'breed' a certain trait into an animal, by narrowing the options that the offspring have. You do not add traits constantly, as is suggested by the ToE, but you reduce them, at times to the detriment of the organism, which can go extinct if it cannot adapt with the needed variability. A parent organism might have 50 possibilities of hair, skin, eye, or other cosmetic traits. By 'selecting' certain ones, either by breeding or by natural selection, you REDUCE the available options. THAT is observed reality, but the ToE claims just the opposite, that organisms are constantly making new genes to ADD variability. This is a flawed view with a basis in 19th century science, not what we know about in modern genetics. The high walls of genetics is the gravity that prevents vertical changes. It will allow the variability that remains within the dna, which contains millions of bits of information &amp; possibilities. But there is NO EVIDENCE that any organism creates new genetic material or can turn scales in to feathers, or fins into feet. Those leaps are in light years, genetically speaking. It is impossible. It could not have happened, &amp; we do not see it happening, now. All we observe is the simple, horizontal variability WITHIN the genetic parameters of the life form. Simply asserting that minor back &amp; forth movement within the horizontal limits of variability does not prove the ability to incrementally build up to major changes in the genetic structure.",39,1575370521,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e5fi5p/the_central_flaw_of_universal_common_ancestry/

Video by Jay Seegert part 1 and part 2 (2 hours),"There are some outrageous things happening in public schools and universities.   I was mostly lucky as I didn't hear too many insults toward Christians and creationists in the course of my 5 science degrees, but times have changed.

I've studied a little evolutionary biology, and never had confrontation with the professor.  I had physics teacher of astrophysics that loved Richard Dawkins, he made a little fun of YECs, but I never confronted him.  It turned out I another student of his were YECs and we did well in his class.

I had to do homeworks and answer exam questions under the Old Universe, evolutionary framework.  I never felt it was profession of faith to give the answers the professors were expecting.  

For example, in a totally NON-religious question about entropy I answered the way the professor expected (entropy is a measure of disorder) when in fact it is a measure of uncertainty or spreading out of entropy and the formal definition:

&gt;  S = log W,  
&gt;delta-S = Inexact Integral ( dQ/T)

Likewise, even in some biology classes I knew the prof was a bit wrong, but tried to go along with what they taught.  I'd only point out their mistake if I was carrying a 100% exam grade since that might earn me the requisite respect to challenge the professor...

Mercifully I didn't suffer what Jay Seegert went through.  Jay gives his testimony and thoughts on the issue of dealing with anti-Christian professors.

Jay relates the harassment his 14-year-old daughter was subjected to by an anti-Christian high school biology teacher.

His advice:
&gt;be respectful, get a good grade, be a good testimony, don't feel like you have debate the teacher.

However Jay relates at all the humilation Chrisitans are subjected to in the classroom.

I found the accounts shocking.  

However, I will say this, if the professors ever asked me in front of the class ""Do you believe in Creation, in Jesus, in a Young Universe?""  I'd say ""yes"" because that's different than reciting the answers on exams about what the professor believes.

Paul's recent article was promised as an answer four months ago but didn't answer it, which was disappointing.

I'm not trying to start a debate here. I just want to hear an answer to the question. It shouldn't be such a complicated question either.

**It's addressed specifically to those creationists who believe that we have never observed a biological change which increased information** (which is, if I'm not mistaken, the official stance of organisations such as CMI and AIG).

If this is true, it should be possible to give me an example of hypothetical biological change that we have NOT observed, but that would definitely entail new information if we did.

(If there *is* no answer to my question, the claim is completely meaningless. It would amount to saying that any observed biological change is *by definition* a loss of information, which is not an informative hypothesis.)

The answer to this question should NOT:

- involve obvious straw men of the evolutionary position (e.g. ""the evolution of a completely new organ from scratch"")

- involve things that couldn't possibly be observed in a human timescale (e.g. ""the evolution of feathers from scales"")

- involve non-biological analogies, like computer code or word processing

**I'm looking for a** ***specific*** **hypothetical biological event,** like (for instance) ""the evolution of a gene with a new function"" (although you'll probably not want to use that one, because it has been observed), **which you, as a creationist, think** ***hasn't*** **been observed but which you'd accept as in increase in information if it were.**

Creation,e2jtgv,stcordova,Molecular Bio Physics Research Assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Examples of where gene duplication fails as a matter of principle,"Evolutionists love to cite gene duplications as a source of new information.  I've argued vociferously that ID proponents don't serve themselves well by framing the ID argument in terms of information (software) vs. chemistry (hardware).

Gene duplications don't explain very well the origins of the Topoisomerase paralogs (duplicates) in humans.  Topoisomerase 2-alpha and 2-beta are an example. If one of the duplicates (paralogs) is missing, sickness and death results.  Evolutionists don't have a good explanation why these specialized complementary topoisomerases should evolve to exist from an ancestral form -- except via the usual handwaving.  They never think how life critical paralogs (such as the Topoisomerases paralogs) could evolve without having to admit it must evolve free of strong selection.  If one paralog is so strongly selected for that it is life critical, do evolutionists realize that without the paralog the creature is already dead?  End of story.  No evolution.  The gene duplication story is worthless.  Sure yeasts don't have these paralogs, but then how did humans evolve them such that they are life critical.


In comparable is the evolution microtubule paralogs by gene duplication.  Without at a bare minimum the alpha,beta, and gamma paralogs, microtubule polarity (as in street signs for a one-way highway), the microtubule is functionless and hence the creature is dead.  Gene duplication is pointless, since the creature would already be dead.  End of story.  No evolution.

Do evolutionists examine these issues?  Well, they claim to solve microtubule evolution by simulataneous gene fusions for no good reason.  Do they work out the a priori probabilities of such events? Nope, they suggests it's natural, but when in fact it would require miracles almost indistinguishable from miracles of special creation. ""Co-evolution""  or ""parallel evolution"" are the new buzzwords.  But they are euphemisms for events that would have to be miraculous as a matter of principle -- except they refuse to say so.

Rob Carter and I share an institutional affiliation in the papers we author, so he is a co-worker and colleague.  

I also consider Paul Price a good friend.

I'm not saying the article is wrong or unhelpful, however, I've been a dissenting voice for about 10 years now saying that defending Intelligent Design by framing it in terms of information will not be as effective as arguing ID in terms of Improbability of Integration. 

James Tour's famous talk on the origin of life is an iconic example of how one would argue for ID in the origin of life without even mentioning ID or even framing the problem in terms of information science.  Tour instead argued (implictly) for the improbability of integration of parts and systems.  It was clear and understandable and avoided esoteric arguments about information. Tours approach to the problem of abiogenesis can be extended to the problem of common descent, but it takes work.

I studied Shannon's theorems in grad school Electrical Engineering courses, and though helpful in understanding some concepts in biology, I think Improbability of Integration is the better route to prosecute the case for creation.",2,1574874398,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/e2j0pf/improbability_of_integration_is_a_better_way_to/

Or maybe it's a design feature to make sure that the cell transporting the oxygen doesn't use any of it at all, so 100% gets to its destination.  
5. No nucleus and no mitochondria mean that there is more room to pack hemoglobin in. The RBC is a specialized cell with fewer organelles, similar to the cells in the crystalline lens of the eye. It needs to get rid of organelles to perform it's duty more efficiently.
6. ""When red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow. [...] Red blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls.""
7. ""When their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, red blood cells release S-nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels, thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen."" 
8. ""Red blood cells also play a part in the body's immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing it""

&gt;""If an unskilled person enters the workshop of an artificer he sees in it many appliances of which he does not understand the use, and which, if he is a foolish fellow, he considers unnecessary. Moreover, should he carelessly fall into the fire, or wound himself with a sharp-edged tool, he is under the impression that many of the things there are hurtful; whereas the craftsman, knowing their use, laughs at his folly. And thus some people presume to find fault with many things in this world, through not seeing the reasons for their existence. For though not required for the furnishing of our house, these things are necessary for the perfection of the universe.""

***

Some personal thoughts/discussion points:

Note that Augustine, and even Aquinas following after him, seemed to interpret the divine works of Genesis 1 as being all instantaneous, at least partially because of certain errors pertaining to physical science – namely, for examples: that stars are incorruptible substances (having beginning, but no natural end) whose movements required supernatural explanation; and that certain creatures were generated via putrefaction, rather than reproduction.  Needless to say, these errors influenced their interpretation of scripture, rather than having arisen because of their understanding of scripture.

Nevertheless, Augustine and Aquinas were, without doubt, intelligent thinkers who were doing their best to understand the Scriptures, with respect to its inherent authority.  The quote provided above is an apt analogy for the folly of many design critics, and not only with respect to the intelligent design of nature.

A design is an “intentional being”.  That means that a design, considered in itself, is something that exists in a mind, rather than as an entity existing in the real world.  Now, we might consider a blueprint, or an instruction manual as a kind of “design” that exists as an entity in the real world, but these objects are really representations of a design, and, in fact, they arise from the intentional object as much as the product itself (say, a house or a machine).  DNA also falls into this category of ""design objects"", which, you might say, stand midway between the mind of the designer, and the final product of his design.

Now, a design is something that exists in the mind of the designer, but our access is only through the products of design, those entitative things that exist in the real world.  It is by the products that we must make inferences to both the design and the designer.  Thus, the mode by which human beings come by knowledge is vulnerable to incomplete or otherwise imperfect perception thereof.  Hence arises the foolish design critic.

Now, one aspect of a design is purpose (also referred to as teleology or final cause).  Purpose is not something that can be measured or verified (unless one has access to the mind of the designer), since we know that there are many cases in which things can fail to exhibit those active powers which produce the ends ordained by their designers.  It is sometimes by defect that a thing may be found failing to produce its ordained ends, as when a remote control runs out of battery power; but it is sometimes by design, as when a thing is made to produce its ordained ends only in certain situations, as when a remote control sits idly, or outside the range of its effective power.

Furthermore, a design may fail to be properly conceived by a human observer in the case that the product of the design has been produced, not by the designer directly, but through some defective instrumental agent.  In our own case, the biological bodies which we have available for observation have been produced by biological reproduction.  That process, by itself, and by design, is apt for the continuation of species; though not (**by itself**) without defects.  It is also by design that such a process should require maintenance-help from God.  

In like manner, any instrumentally used machine may, of itself, be apt for the production of, say, ball bearings, chair legs, or other items, and yet will require periodic maintenance in order to ensure that it will continue making its ordained products without defects.  And, as every naturalist misses, **every created thing is, of logical necessity, in need of divine help in accomplishing its ordained ends**.  Theologians like Augustine and Aquinas had all such help in mind when they spoke of God's mercy and grace.  Even existence itself, which every created thing ultimately receives from God, is given by God in an act of mercy.  So, a world that is separated from the help of God is expected to yield increasing defectiveness.  Thus, another error which a design critic might make is in attributing error to the design, rather than to the defective execution of the design.",25,1573502456,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/duxz0z/augustine_on_the_errors_of_design_criticism/

This is part of why science needed a Christian world view as one of the preconditions for its discovery/invention. Not only does a Christian world view see nature as orderly, following laws, very well designed, predictable -- all of this being based on the nature of God the creator, but Christianity also brings a logical approach to things (as I just realized).  Without these two things, there is no way that science can develop.  I don't know any other worldview or religion that has these things. Atheism certainly doesn't. The universe just happens to be the way that it is - and based on that assumption, there would be no reason to believe that it has orderly and repeatable laws, until Christian scientists came along and discovered them!

&gt;we’ll see that Darwinian processes nicely account for changes at the species and genus levels of biological classification, but not for changes at the level of family or higher.

Most of what Behe writes in the book seems to depend on this methodological principle, yet I'm not sure I understand the logic of it and I'm hoping someone here can help me. My difficulty is as follows (pardon the length of this).

-----

Behe believes in common descent. Basically, he differs from the mainstream only in that he believes that the mechanism for some evolutionary changes was intelligent design, rather than random mutation followed by selection. So far, so good.

Now it is incumbent on anyone making that argument (as the denizens of r/debateevolution will delight in telling you) to draw a clear line between what evolution can do and what intelligent design needs to be invoked for. By making the claim I quoted above Behe is drawing such a line: for him it's genus level but not beyond.

But obviously, if you accept common descent, higher taxonomic levels are the result of divergence in the past. So the different phyla, for instance, will once, in the deep past, have started as different species, then different genera, and so further down the line. If he is consistent Behe should accept this.

So what is Behe saying by the paragraph I quoted? Is it the case that:

1) His rule only applies to *modern* genera?

2) His rule applies to all genus-degree divergence in the past: so that basically, whenever evolution tries to diverge further than the genus level, it needs ID to kick-start the process?

----

Both are incredibly problematic, and he doesn't seem to consider the implications.

If its 1), then this is equivalent to saying that intelligent design was active until about two million years ago and then stopped, which is bizarre (and unwarranted).

If it's 2), then the evidence he produces isn't evidence. There's no more reason to regard the failure of the Galapagos finches to diverge beyond the genus level as evidence for evolution not working than for intelligent design not working. By making such an argument he's tacitly assuming 1).

If I'm misinterpreting Behe I'm eager to learn how. It seems to me this undermines his whole case.",61,1572589646,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/dq0hto/genus_level_but_not_beyond_what_exactly_does_behe/

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically:  


&gt;Nature’s predictability is clearly essential for a working nature. What we can’t know and yet need to is precisely how many and what sort of miracles it takes to ruin a reasonable trust in nature’s predictability. But even this doesn’t tell us all the miracles that e.g. God might do, let alone what He actually did. Some miracles may have happened that didn’t leave easily discernible evidence behind (e.g. we have no physical evidence of Jesus turning water into wine). Or even if they did, perhaps some miracles were so large in scope that we might mistake them for natural events (e.g. events like Creation and Noah’s Flood). This is no better than methodological naturalism; it arbitrarily assumes what e.g. God did.  
&gt;  
&gt;*We can’t know precisely what God did when and where unless He tells us. But if He told us, it would no longer be* *prehistory.*  
&gt;  
&gt;We can’t know precisely what God did when and where unless He tells us. But if He told us, it would no longer be *pre*history. So there’s no reason to trust in deep time history if miracles are allowed in prehistory. In fact, allowing miracles means there’s no way to say *anything* certain about specific events in prehistory (see [CMI’s views on the Intelligent Design Movement](https://creation.com/cmis-views-on-the-intelligent-design-movement)). This is hardly a solid basis for a historical framework.

&amp;#x200B;

Inherently, every single deep-time dating method assumes both naturalism and uniformitarianism. Neither of these assumptions are necessary or even appropriate from within a Biblical worldview. Thus, as Christians, the only way we would be justified in believing in Deep Time would be if God told us in the Scriptures that it was true (and he did not).

Creation,dnw5ku,NeatIdea,,t2_7j0wgu,self.Creation,,Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve,"Dawkins recognises the recurrent laryngeal nerve as being astonishing:

“It is a branch of one of the cranial nerves, those nerves that lead directly from the brain rather than from the spinal cord. One of the cranial nerves, the vagus (the name means ‘wandering’ and is apt), has various branches, two of which go to the heart, and two on each side to the larynx (voice box in mammals). On each side of the neck, one of the branches of the laryngeal nerve goes straight to the larynx, following a direct route such as a designer might have chosen. The other one goes to the larynx via an astonishing detour. It dives right down into the chest, loops around one of the main arteries leaving the heart (a different artery on the left and right sides, but the principle is the same), and then heads back up the neck to its destination.

“If you think of it as the product of design, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a disgrace. Helmholz would have had even more cause to send it back than the eye. But, like the eye, it makes perfect sense the moment you forget design and think history instead.” (p. 356)

Thinking historically, there was a wise designer who once said,

Matthew 12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for **out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh**.

Luke 6:45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: **for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.**

The Creator told us about this connection and made us thus.

In fact there are dozens bible verses that speak of the connection between the heart and mouth or word, or singing.

Psalm 138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.

Deuteronomy 30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.

Job 22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.

Psalm 104:5 suggests that the earth is fixed in place, and Psalm 104:2 indicates God himself is covered in light. So God could have been providing light on the earth even before he made the Sun. So rotation of the earth in this light would give us the evening and the morning of the first day. Except Genesis 1:2b ""And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."" indicates God was moving not the earth supporting the idea the earth is fixed while maintaining the understanding of evenings and mornings of the days before the sun was created.

The [Tychonic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system) which used the mathematics of the heliocentric Ptolemaic System, but insisted the earth was fixed.

In 1838 it was discovered that stars had a parallax which caused a rejection of the Tychonic system.

Perhaps the stars about the eccentric of the sun's orbit around the earth.

Light is a wave so we expect it to have an aether. However when the speed of the earth through the aether was measured, it was discovered to be zero. This evidence could be used to support the idea of a fixed earth.

However, this led to the development of special relativity, which is supported by the biblical references to light having a way rather than a path, because in the frame of a light ray, the journey time is instantaneous.

&gt;Job 38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,

Another observation that seems consistent with a rotating earth is that the equator bulges.

However, when Einstein developed general relativity, one principle he relied on was [Mach's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%27s_principle), which wikipedia states is based on the question:

""You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?""

This seems pretty similar to the question why if the earth is fixed and the stars rotate about it, does it bulge?

There are some solutions to Einstein's field equations that have a rotating uniiverse such as [Gödel metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_metric).

As it stands our physics is inconsistent, and our cosmological models even more so. When Christ returns, he will be glorified in showing these models are just hinting at the truth, and these descriptions are made consistent when we understand his word to be true.",3,1571834812,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/dlysw2/god_gives_light/

The 2019 Nobel prize research by Kaelin, Semenza, and Ratcliffe again shows the importance of Intelligent Design in biology/biochemistry/medicine.

First of all note, that anyone who does research in biology or medicine assumes that things are there for a logical purpose. ""The work was made possible, Kaelin added, because the scientists were trying at first to just understand the biology"" [ref1]

_(Please correct and add on to anyting I have here below)_

Their research studies how cells react to hypoxia. We'll see that both types of hypoxia are targetted by the same mechanism: (i)  the hypoxia that comes from holding your breath, (ii) a more long-term hypoxia, such as when you move to a higher altitude, or hypoxia in your tissues due to obesity or diabetes, or hypoxia in cancer tumours due to their rapid growth. 

Here's what happens:

1. there is a gene to make a protein HIF. HIF is actually a family of protien complexes: so there is more than one gene. HIF-1alpha is on chromosome 14 and HIF-1beta is on chromosome 1 (ref2, 3). Both subunits have to be created for HIF to work.
2.  the proteasome, a massive complex, chops up and destroys HIF (as it does with other unneeded or damaged proteins). This works by hydroxides bonding to HIF-1a, and then ubiquitins bonds to it and marks the protein for degradation.

So the cell is producing HIF and then destroying it continually. Why? What is the advantage to doing this (presumably for millions of years before step 3 occurs)?

3. If there is a deficit in oxygen in the cell, then HIF is not degraded and destroyed. (This happens because, due to a deficiency in oxygen, hyroxides cannot bond to HIF-1a).
4. So now we have a protien that the cell can use to sense when there is a lack of oxygen.  What does it do with this?

""Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are proteins that rapidly accumulate when hypoxia occurs and mediate transcriptional control of a number of targets."" (ref 4).

5. HIF is used to activate other genes that do important stuff: it activates genes that regulate glucose metabolism (ie. cellular respiration - that require O2), as well as angiogenesis (the formation of blood vessels), erythropoietin (the hormone that affects the formation of red blood cells) ... ""under hypoxic conditions, HIFα hydroxylation is blocked and become stable to activate large number of downstream genes associated with angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis"" (ref 4)  HIF-1a has been called ""a master regulator for the expression of genes involved in the response to hypoxia in most mammalian cells"" (ref 5)

6. How does this activation occur? Well ""This complex binds to an enhancer domain of the hypoxia responsive element (HRE) located either at the 5′ or 3′ region of target genes"" (ref 5). In otherwords, all of the target genes have a domain that is repsonsive to HIF-1a.
7. Note that some of the effects of these genes take a long time - days? - to have any effect. Angiogenesis does not happen instantly. And even the mechanism of generating new blood vessels is not understood. (How does an arteriole or capillary extend into a hypoxic area and then make sure that it is attached to a venule instead of dead-ending or connecting to another arteriole?)

7. There are immediate cellular effects too: ""HIF-1α stimulates glycolysis and actively represses mitochondrial function and oxygen consumption"". (ref 5). This means that HIF-1a not only tries to mitigate long term hypoxia by increasing red blood cell production and growing more blood vessels, but it also cuts back on oxygen consumption by switching cellular respiration from the more efficient oxygen based Krebs-cycle, to the anerobic glycolysis process.


I think that this is ample evidence of intelligent design. The number of things that all have to be working at the same time for HIF to have any effect is really quite large. HIF is useless if there is no HRE domain on genes. It is also useless if both subunits on different genes are not being produced. If it is not carefully designed to have a strong reaction to oxygen, then there is no point having it around either. Get someone, eg an engineer who knows some biochemistry, who doesn't know anything about how HIF works and ask them how they would design a cellular system that detects oxygen deficiency and then triggers specific functions to help the cell and surrounding tissues survive hypoxia. They'll come up with something that is basically the same as this system. It's not some sort of clever accident (as most of evolution claims to be), it's a very intelligent design that requires a lot of working parts, some of which don't have any effect for days or longer (I was unable to find a time line for angiogenesis, though this article (ref 6) desribes the temporal organization of it).

Creation,dg07xf,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,Another good example of what creation scientists are up against...,"I'm sure that many of you are familiar with [this conversation between Bob Enyart and Jack Horner.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rts6wGjJpXE&amp;t=399s)  In it, Enyart offers to pay for C14 testing of Mary Schweitzer's dino tissue, and Horner flatly refuses.  

I can understand why Horner would refuse.  Merely running that test, whatever the result, would absolutely ruin his career and reputation, because *merely entertaining the possibility* that dinosaurs are not millions of years old is heresy.  

But Reddit is anonymous, and there is nothing at stake in saying you would C14 test the dino bones.  I mean, you don't actually have to test them after you agree to.

So yesterday, I posted this question to debateevolution: [Would you be in favor of systematically carbon-dating ALL of the soft tissue found in fossils that are thought to be millions of years old?](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfl5z0/would_you_be_in_favor_of_systematically/)

The overwhelmingly unified and fervent answer was ""No!""

This genuinely surprised me.  

One form of radiometric dating is often used to compare with another, and this case should be no different, particularly when the science of biochemistry justifies believing that this material could be within the range of C14 testing.    

The objections fell into two categories.  

**The first** amounts to arguing in a circle.  The discussion went something like this:

ME: I wonder if the methods of radiometric dating which put these animals millions of years in the past are correct.  Let's use C14 to check them.  

OTHER: That would be pointless.  Those fossils are too old for C14 to be useful.

ME: How do you know they are too old?

OTHER:  Because those methods of radiometric dating which put these animals millions of years in the past are not incorrect.

Formally, I suppose you could arrange the argument like this:

Either these methods are correct or they are incorrect.

They are not incorrect.

Therefore, they are correct.

The form is fine, but when you don't really accept the possibility that they are incorrect, you are simply saying this: *These methods are correct because they are not incorrect,* which is question begging.  

**The second objection** could be paraphrased thus:

*The world's most sophisticated labs are incapable of accurately dating proteins, etc. from partially fossilized bone*

or

*The scientists who run these labs cannot recognize when the result is out of the test's dependable range.*

Again, I found this to be a genuinely surprising response.  If they are right about this form of radiometric dating, why should I trust *any* radiometric dating?  

I expect the retort would be ""You can only trust the methods that yield millions/billions of years.""

Baffling.

The question should be easy to answer.  **Of course we should use C14 to test this material.**  

The fact that it was impossible to get anyone to admit this *even anonymously* is a good illustration of the uphill battle creation scientists face.

Assuming a more recent and most severe bottleneck of 1,000 humans existing even 50,000 years ago, the only way we get to only a \~7 billion population today is with an average growth rate of 0.0315% per year. The growth rate is even smaller with a less severe or earlier bottleneck. Either way, this is a minuscule growth rate.

&gt; The question, then, is: are the New Testament references to Adam merely to the literary Adam, the figure in the story, much as I might refer to Hamlet in Shakespeare’s play, or are they to the historical Adam? I argue that although some passages might be interpreted to be about no more than the literary Adam, when it comes to Romans 5.12-21, Paul is asserting the reality of the historical Adam, for he is talking about causal effects of Adam outside the story. A figure in a story, like Hamlet, cannot have real world effects outside the story; but Adam’s sin, however we interpret it, is said to have real world effects upon human history and us today. So Paul’s teaching confirms what I argued from Genesis, that there was a historical Adam, however cloaked in mythological language he may have been.  Now what remains to be explored is whether and how this conclusion can be reconciled with the findings of modern palaeoanthropology and genetics, a daunting task!",84,1568824764,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/d60f5z/william_lane_craig_now_believes_the_bible_teaches/

Creation,cxcpds,Under_the_shadow,YEC,t2_bra1v,self.Creation,,Climate change and Creation.,"As christians we know the source of all the decay and death in the world is linked to sin. Sin is creation separated from Creator. As our world groans, from the virus humanity has become, we feel the effects on nature   in ever increasing disasters. We mine and farm for resources with increasing voracity and terraform environments to increase yield and gains. Without the need to venture into politics and strictly talking from a biblical perspective we can see that we are truly living in the last days. 

I will address this matter from a YEC point of view, and even if we disagree on timescales we can still come to similar conclusions.

This world has been destroyed once before. Noah and his family were the only ones to survive. Noah's world was flooded and buried in a rapid manner. It is from this rapid destruction and burial that the conditions for Fossil fuels came to be. Organic matter decaying without oxygen is the primordial soup for petroleum. It is ironic that our civilization has advanced leaps and bounds, when we learned to harness the power stored in oil. It is also ironic that it is this carbon, which was stored and forgotten in the depths of the earth that is once again out and about. Just like in the days of Noah.... Our society is powered by the remnants of an ancient society that God once deemed too corrupt to allow to exist, and to which God brought swift Judgement. 

It is ironic that we now have a NOAA once again PREACHING about looming the destruction of the world. 
It is ironic that now science wants to save the world, and the Christian world is deaf to it's preaching.

But can the world be saved by solar, wind, nuclear, and carbon taxes? Can humanity pull together and save itself?  Can all the nation's of the world come together and sacrifice comfort, progress and sovereignty? Can technology rescue us from our addiction to oil? Will we run out of time?

We live in a fractured world, even our own nation is divided in a million ways. I would even say our own families are divided. Compromise is nowhere in sight.

The problems of the world, the greed of corporations, the senseless murders, the indifference of the wealthy, the deficit of Justice, the explotation of others, the pestilence with increasing resilience, the willful extinction of animals and on and on. All these have one source. That is Sin.  

We are living in the last days both biblically and scientifically. The system cannot continue to sustain this level attrition, there is no free energy outside of God. 

Interesting enough, yeast which represents sin, in the Bible, functions in similar way. Yeast works thru the dough, and as it consumes nutrients and releases CO2 making the dough rise and giving bread those airpockets. The reaction ends when yeast suffocates itself with its own byproducts. 

This world is beautiful and even with death and decay that loom at every corner, we can marvel in the creating power of God. This world was designed for perpetual motion and perpetual homeostasis. Yet once sin entered the world, we were severed from the source of perpetuity and immortality, which is God. The laws of physics now took control of our world and carried us to entropy.

As christians we are called to be stewards of creation, and set examples on how to love our neighbors and respect all life. But we must also never forget, we are not called to save the world we are called to leave it. Only God can save our world. 

So, the question becomes one of conviction and faith, do you believe humans can save themselves or can you believe God will do it?

Only Christ can delay with the source, only he can fix the sin problem. We must do everything in our power to care for the Earth but we cannot compromise our faith in Christ, for only he can truly fix the world. 

It is ironic that the world is now walking up to the realization that there can truly be a end to all things.",12,1567143661,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cxcpds/climate_change_and_creation/

Creation,ctzvlt,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,"Darwin Devolves: Summary of the Argument against Evolution, Part 3 (Conclusion)","Behe’s Devolution Argument rests on the claim that it is much easier to break or degrade a piece of genetic code by randomly messing with it than it is to construct a new section of code by the same mindless process.
 
Nobody should disagree with this premise.
 
From this it follows that hundreds to thousands of degrading mutations will be available for selection before the first constructive mutation can submit his application.  And since this constructive mutation will be completely random, it's another roll of the dice to determine whether or not it will be useful at that moment. If not, there will be hundreds to thousands more degrading mutations available for possible selection before the next constructive one randomly appears.

And so on.

I thought of the following analogy to help illustrate the force of the argument. (It is not in Behe’s book; it just occurred to me in the course of thinking through his argument.)
 
Imagine a chain of knife factories spread out in several cities across the world.  The passing of one week represents a generation.

Functioning machines in these factories randomly break at a rate of one per week.  Some breaks are less consequential than others.  Maybe an electric pencil sharpener dies in one while a light bulb blows in another.  In a few, however, the knife-sharpening machine goes out.  This is potentially life threatening for the factory, and indeed several close as a result.  But in one town, a need for blunt knives arises, and so that factory is able to continue to thrive, although the niche market for that factory has gotten smaller and more specialized.

Each factory gets one random brand new machine per year. This year's is a bubble gum dispenser. I will be generous and allow that that is useful; maybe it improves morale. Next year's is a wind-up toy. After that, a beard trimmer.  I'll let you decide whether or not those will be useful.

If you think they are useful, they will then enter the lottery to be broken with all of the other machines in the factory, at a rate of one per week.

At the very least, I believe the analogy works in two ways:
 
1)	It illustrates how the ephemeral differences which distinguish one genus or species from another can arise through evolution. 
 
2) 	It illustrates how unreasonable it is to believe that evolution can build creatures that differ from one another at the level of family or higher.  Evolutionists point to the bubble gum dispenser and ask, “Now then, what is to stop the knife factory from transforming into a Six-Flags?”  Hopefully, those that read Behe’s book will see the clear answer to that question: Natural selection, acting on mutations which are randomly available, randomly useful, and almost always degrade function, cannot do that.  
 
Oh, [I forgot about mIC.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cbi2sz/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/)  Sorry.  That means that the brand new machine cannot be a bubble gum dispenser.  It cannot even be a mouse trap.  It has to be a hook-and-eye latch.

Feel free to critique the analogy. I’m sure it can be tightened up.",16,1566491592,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ctzvlt/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/

A more logical example would be how relativists who assert that there is no truth must borrow from absolutists/objectivists in order to even make the claim. 

While it is admittedly somewhat of a reduction to absurdity given our global population, I’m genuinely surprised (and hopefully not in a glaringly naive way) that the inutility of homosexuality isn’t at the very least more widely discussed.

[AiGs total assets number about 56 million circa 2017](http://990finder.foundationcenter.org/990results.aspx?990_type=&amp;fn=Answers+in+genesis&amp;st=&amp;zp=&amp;ei=&amp;fy=&amp;action=Search). All in all, that probably makes Ken Ham and any business associates of his well off men and women. 

The institute for Creation Research is a similar deal with net assets of about [24](http://990finder.foundationcenter.org/990results.aspx?990_type=&amp;fn=Institute+for+creation+research&amp;st=&amp;zp=&amp;ei=&amp;fy=&amp;action=Search) to [27](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7485#income-statement) million, and a net revenue of probably a bit under 6 million. 


So, not huge, but certainly respectable. 



As far as I know, there isnt an Evolution focused (or primarily evolution focused) organisation/business thats worth that much, or rakes in that much money. 




Secondly the religious/theological component of Creationism ID. From what I understand, many adherents to creationism believe that creationism is a ""my way or the highway"" interpretation. If its disproven, the whe belief system falls apart. 

On the other hand, most scientists are either theistic/religious evolutionists (and big bang ists, speed of light ists etc) or ""believe in a higher power""-ists. Do you think their interpretation of sprituality (or for the materialist scientists lack thereof) is a reliant on evolutions (and other anti ID theories) validity? 

Especially since if its false, many of the tests and outcomes of their study will not be correct if they adhere to evolutionary (and other anti ID) principles?

Creation,cbi2sz,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,"Darwin Devolves: Summary of the Argument against Evolution, Part 2B","In *Darwin Devolves,* Michael Behe concerns himself with three factors: natural selection, random mutation, and irreducible complexity. [I have already made a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c25yix/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/) about how he uses natural selection and random mutation to argue against the possibility that evolution can account for complex systems.  [I have also made a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c7z39j/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/) about Behe’s original use of irreducible complexity (IC).  
 
This post is about Behe’s more recent twist on IC.
 
He calls it mini-irreducible complexity (mIC).  
 
The original IC argument is essentially this: *Since some structures are “composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function,” of the structure, and since “the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning,” such structures cannot have evolved gradually because the stages along the way to the IC structure would have done nothing useful for selection to keep and add to.*


Mini-irreducible complexity (mIC) is IC on a very small scale.  So, if IC is a mousetrap, then mIC is the hook-and-eye latch. for your screen door.
 
The *smallest scale* of mIC involves a feature that requires, for instance, the interaction of only two amino acids.  Both mutations must have occurred before positive selection can happen.  
 
So what are the odds that this smallest of mIC systems could evolve?
 
According to a paper published by Behe and David Snoke, this happens **once every billion generations.** 
 
He came by the number using a simple computer model of protein evolution.  (This same model had been used earlier by such prominent geneticists as M. Kimura and T. Ohata.).  First, Behe and Snoke used the model to calculate the number of generations required for a *single mutation* in a particular amino acid in a particular protein.  This happens once every 10,000 generations.  
 
So that’s 10,000 generations for a particular amino acid in a particular protein versus a *billion generations*  for an mIC of just *two mutations.*   That is a massive difference.  Obviously, for even the simplest mIC structure, the difficulty of evolving is exponentially greater.   
 
However, mathematical geneticist, Michael Lynch, was eager to disprove the result.  He ran a simulation of his own, which Behe describes below:

*“In a computer one can always manipulate the expected time to a mutation by assuming the hypothetical population size of a theoretical species to be larger or smaller, the target region of a gene to be greater or smaller, or the helpfulness of the new feature to be stronger or weaker. Lynch’s paper emphasized optimistic cases of all those variables. But none of the factors alter the bottom line that two required changes are enormously more difficult to obtain by random mutation than one.”*

 Lynch’s model concluded that 100 million generations were needed for a two mutation mIC .  This is obviously a shorter time than Behe’s model; nevertheless, the results confirmed those of Behe and Snoke: for even the simplest mIC structure, the difficulty of evolving increases exponentially, even under ideal conditions. 

As Behe writes, 

*“When a very intelligent critic, dedicated to proving something wrong comes up with at least the same qualitative behavior, you can bank on it being correct.” *
 
He goes on: 

*“If just two simple molecular changes are needed for a feature to evolve, there’s a quantum leap in difficulty for Darwin’s mechanism.   The more required changes, the exponentially worse it becomes.  That’s an insurmountable problem for undirected evolution...because damaging a gene only requires a single hit, and it is the ratio of times that is crucial.  Since single mutations will appear so much faster, that means the kind of damaging yet beneficial mutations revealed by modern research will spread in a comparative lightning flash, ages before the completion of any mIC features.”*",24,1562772279,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cbi2sz/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/

**I'm writing a rebuttal to the article above.**   

&amp;#x200B;

*""From a biblical perspective, extraterrestrial life does not seem reasonable.""*     

I disagree with this statement completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

*""It is the earth that was designed for life (Isaiah 45:18), not the heavens.""*     

This verse does not say other places in the heavens aren't also formed for life. It just states that the Earth was definitely formed for life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*""but where does the Bible discuss the creation of life on the “lights in the expanse of the heavens?”""*

The Bible doesn't talk about this in depth because Genesis is the creation story of Earth in particular and not the rest of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

This entire article completely ignores the existence of angels. Angels are not human beings, they are ET. Where did angels live before the Earth and human beings were created? There's nothing in the Bible that makes me think angels were created AFTER humans beings were created. Everything in the Bible suggests angels existed before humans. 

*Hewbrews 2:7 You made them a little lower than the angels.*      

To me, that implies that angels were in existence first, if you're going to compare the creation of humans to them in a verse like that.

&amp;#x200B;

More Bible verse proof:  
When were angels created: [https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don\_stewart/don\_stewart\_6.cfm](https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_6.cfm)

[https://billygraham.org/answer/when-were-the-angels-created-3/](https://billygraham.org/answer/when-were-the-angels-created-3/)

&amp;#x200B;

I take Genesis statement of ""in the beginning..."" to mean that as the true starting point of everything in the universe, but when it starts talking about Earth's creation in particular that is a separate event further down in the timeline of history. Or maybe ""heaven"" in that sentence just means the stars and galaxies we can see nearby from the Earth, but not EVERYTHING in existence.  Because Genesis is really just an account of the Earth's creation and maybe the stuff visible from Earth. He created the Earth and the nearby stuff in 7 days, he just didn't create the entirety of everything in 7 days, otherwise its impossible to have the angels singing as they witness the creation of the Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

So at the very least, we have angels who are ET, and we likely have other unfallen worlds that are also ET, who existed before the Earth. I don't know if they too are created in God's image or not. The Bible seems to suggest we are more special than angels or other beings because we are created in God's image. And of course there's lots of theories about what makes us humans ""God's image"" in contrast to angels. My personal theory is strongly rooted in our ability to reproduce, since that's something angels cannot do.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bible mentions ""sons of god"" and ""the heavens and all of their hosts"" many times in various verses. That could just mean angels, but it also could mean other unfallen worlds. We just don't know for sure. But that's why I don't agree with statements such as *""there's no such thing as aliens.""* We have proof from Holy Scripture that God created other intelligent beings besides humans, aka angels. Angels are intelligent and have free will. Lucifer and his fallen angels couldn't have rebelled against God and be condemned to the Lake of Fire if they didn't have freedom to choose obedience or rebellion.

&amp;#x200B;

*""One might suppose that alien beings have never sinned, in which case they would not need to be redeemed, but then another problem emerges: they suffer the effects of sin, despite having never sinned. Adam’s sin has affected all of creation—not just mankind.""*

Indeed they do. We know the Good angels still weep over the tragedy of humans and they rejoice when someone repents. It isn't hard to imagine the other unfallen heavenly hosts are also watching us and also weep and sing as things play out here on Earth.   

[https://www.beliefnet.com/inspiration/angels/7-bible-verses-about-angels-rejoicing.aspx](https://www.beliefnet.com/inspiration/angels/7-bible-verses-about-angels-rejoicing.aspx)

If angels didn't experience emotions such as joy and sorrow, it would be awfully hard for them to empathize with and comfort Jesus before his execution. It would be hard for them to want to help and protect human beings if they didn't empathize with the human condition.    

We all know God has the ability to be grieved over sinners and have righteous anger towards evil. So there's no reason good angels can't experience these emotions too.     

So all unfallen beings get to watch the contagion (sin) on Earth and gets to weep over it, but that doesn't mean the contagion spreads to sinless beings, otherwise good angels would suddenly become bad angels just for being here with us on the Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

*""Extraterrestrial life is an evolutionary concept; it does not comport with the biblical teachings of the uniqueness of the earth and the distinct spiritual position of human beings.""*        

I agree the way ET is portrayed in movies is based on evolution, but that doesn't mean that ET isn't found in the Bible as created beings that existed before humans, such as angels.

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion:**

**A.** ET exists. aka Angels and probably other unfallen worlds mentioned as the ""sons of god"" and ""heaven and their hosts"" in the Bible.     

**B.** Genesis is about the unique creation of the Earth (and maybe the nearby area) while the already existing angels watch and sing out in joy at the creation of a new world.     

**C.** It doesn't matter much that angels and other ET exist since they aren't going to be visiting us in little flying saucers or speaking to us directly since we have a contagion (sin) loose on this planet. We human beings are in ""quarantine"" since we have the contagion. The only people allowed into the war zone are the ""hospital staff"", aka Jesus and his good angels, since they're the only ones qualified to try to help us sick humans out against the sick (bad) angels and our own wickedness.",51,1562456105,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ca08ya/proof_of_aliens_in_the_bible/

This was brought to my attention in another thread:

https://www.icr.org/article/genesis-chinese-pictographs/

The claim of Mr Johnson:

&gt; Ancient Chinese pictographs are silent witnesses, like fingerprints, of historical events reported in Genesis. In particular, the details of these word-symbols are clues that point to how the earliest Chinese must have known basic facts of Genesis 1–11 at the very time their pictographs were invented

So, why are the modern characters, introduced in the past century, the basis of this proof of Genesis? The history of written Chinese is well documented and predates the modern ""simplified"" script by millennia. 

Each character can be deconstructed, into its radicals, with each part having a meaning. The examples:

""造 create""
辶 + 告 
walk+talk (tell/solicit/denounce/file a law suit)

&gt; “to create” in ancient Chinese is composed of the components “to speak/talk” and “walking”—consistent with the Genesis account of God using His mouth to create and Adam being created fully mature and thus able to walk, as follows

In brackets are the alternative meaning of a particular character. You can see the most useful meanings were picked. 

""告""
Broken down further:

* + 土 + 口
*Living + soil (earth/homemade/unrefined) + mouth/entrance/edge of a knife - dictionary translation. The first radical (which was defined to mean living by the author), as far as I know, does not exist and he redefines 口 to mean man, so according to him these characters together mean: living dust man.

""園 园 garden""
The first character is traditional, the second is simplified (like all the others in the article). I guess they went with the traditional character as it was easier to assign a particular meaning to it?

土+口+ 囗 + 亻+ *
sand+mouth+entrance+person - is a dictionary translation to this string

* 人 (person) is what they meant this character should be, but that is not the radical in the example. Again 口 is redefined to mean breath, so they make this string read as ""dust+breath+enclosure+person+person""

&gt; why else would the early Chinese combine the ideas of “two persons” who received the “breath” of life after the first one of those two persons (Adam) was made from the “dust” of the earth?  

""船 boat""
舟 + 八 + 口
boat+eight+mouth

&gt; These Chinese characters recall that there were exactly eight survivors of the worldwide Flood

Except it's not 八 (eight), its 几 (how many, how much?)

""洪 flood""
氵+ 共
water + total
廾 + 一 + 八
hands joined + one + eight -  is my translation to this string. But the author says it means 'together+earth+eight"". Also, it's not 廾 (together), it's 卄 (twenty/twentieth).

In this post, I will address his argument using irreducible complexity.  (I have already [made a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c25yix/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/) about how he uses natural selection and random mutation to argue against the probability that the evolution can account for complex systems.)


Darwin himself provided a means of falsifying his hypothesis:

“If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.”

*-Origin of Species*

It should be noted, first, that the phrase “could not possibly” sets an impossible and unscientific standard.  Evolution, as absurdly improbable as it is, is not logically impossible, like, say, a circular square.  Should we believe every claim that is not *absolutely impossible?*  Obviously not.  We should believe what is most justifiable over what is less.  


Here is Michael Behe’s **definition of Irreducible Complexity** (IC): “A single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.” 

His argument is that it is unreasonable to believe that such a system could come together piece by piece, gradually, by the mechanism of evolution.  He maintains that it had to emerge whole before it would have been useful (and, therefore, positively selected by nature).

Behe has presented the bacterial flagellum as one example of irreducible complexity, and it has become the poster child for the idea.  His argument is entirely reasonable.   The burden of proof is on those who say such systems can emerge gradually by a mindless process.  

How would one do that?  

**The plausible way to falsify Behe's idea,** would be to explain how each of the gradual steps occurred, demonstrating *empirically* how each stage could have functioned as a precursor to the next.  This could be done by simply knocking out the genes for the flagellum in a bacterium.

This has not even been attempted.

Of course there have been objections.  They usually run like this: “Behe seems unaware of exaptation, (i.e., the co-opting of structures that do one thing to do something new).”  Of course, Behe is aware of this basic concept.  But one must do more than cite exaptation.  One must demonstrate plausibly how it could have happened in each stage.
 
Perhaps the most famous opposition has been **Ken Miller’s,** presented during the Dover trial.  (Here is [a very enlightening documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ToSEAj2V0s&amp;t=1513s) about the trial.  See from around 17:00-35:00.)  

Miller points out that removing several of the proteins making up the flagellum leaves something called a type III secretion system.  He cites this as a precursor of the flagellum and declares the idea falsified.

But **his argument fails on at least two levels.**

1) There are good reasons to believe that the type III secretion system is a devolved version of the flagellum, not a precursor, and thus not evidence of a functional earlier stage in the evolution of the flagellum.  See [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4uJ6y5Y29g&amp;t=1119s) at around 16:00 for Stephen Meyer’s summary of this argument.  It was an argument made by *evolutionary biologists* even at the time of the Dover trial.  See again the video I linked above.)

2)  Even if one believes that it is a precursor, it would be only one stage in the evolution of the flagellum.  What might the earlier stages have been?  What about the subsequent ones?
 
These questions have not been answered.

In fact, the *actual experiments* that have been done have confirmed that the flagellum is, in fact, irreducibly complex in as much as they have knocked out the genes in the steps immediately preceding the flagellum and found that they do nothing on their own.  (Again, see the Meyer presentation above.)

“Alright,” you may be thinking, “so it cannot have happened gradually, and obviously it could not have happened, by chance, all at once, but maybe it happened, by chance, in chunks of mutations.”

Creation,c6xrsw,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Some points about Abiogenesis,"## Some points about Abiogenesis 

First of all, most evolutionists claim that abiogenesis is distinct from evolution. This is interesting. In one sense this is true, since strictly speaking there can be no evolution, no natural selection, before the first living thing exists. So evolution only starts once abiogenesis is complete. (Actually there can be no evolution before there is life AND variation. Since if there is no variation then there is nothing to select.)  However, evolution assumes abiogenesis because if life did not arise by chance, then it arose from some intelligent agent, some plan and design. This would require either aliens or God. A few people are okay with this, e.g. some Old Earth Creationists, some evolutionists. They just say that however life started, and we don't know, it most certainly evolved from there using standard Darwinian processes. It is also becoming more common to hear the term ""chemical evolution"" when discussing abiogenesis, but this seems like an oxymoron.

On the one hand, it is disingenuous to argue that abiogenesis is distinct from evolution since most would agree that evolution requires/includes abiogenesis as part of the theory of the how life came to be the way it is. Also, allowing a divinity to intervene at one point in history and create life sets a bad precedent. What if he also intervened later - e.g. at the Cambrian explosion? That would really mess up evolutionary theory.  

On the other hand, it is really good that people consider them separate things. This is because those who study abiogenesis are more able to admit that there are problems and unresolved issues. We don't see this from the evolution advocates. I suspect than any evolutionist who starts discussing problems with evolution would face such a backlash that it's simply not done. It's nice that abiogenesis research is not like that. For example, it's really easy to find all sorts of articles detailing the unsolved and possibly intractable problems with the RNA world theory (the currently most favoured one). They are quite open about this and happy to discuss problems and criticisms (unlike people in /r/debateEvolution). They are also pursuing other avenues of investigation besides the dominant RNA-world theory (e.g. ANA, PNA, GNA, and TNA worlds).

## Arguments against abiogenesis

The two main arguments against abiogenesis that I know of are: 

1. the biochemical argument. This is best explained by Dr. James Tour in the [Pascal Lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQXgJ-dXM4)  If you don't want to watch the whole thing 1.5 hours, there is a kind of summary in the ""Dream Team"" section that goes from at 1:03:00 to about 1:07:00.
2. the functional argument. This is explained by Dr. Paul Nelson and summarized in [my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c4i3xh/dear_creationists_please_explain_how_abiogenesis/erx5ng6/) 

As far as I can tell, neither of these two arguments have been clearly refuted.

There is a further argument that is related, though perhaps not directly part of abiogenesis. 

I'll call it the argument from complexity. Have a look at the [Roche Biochemical Pathways map](http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1). There are two pages here and this incredibly complex map of cellular metabolism is still incredibly simplified from the actual complexity of a living cell. Note that a whole organism like a human being is far far more complex than the complexity of a single cell.  Now try and look for any sort of flowchart or schematic diagram of any industrial process, or complex technology. I couldn't find anything that is anywhere near this complex. Perhaps something like the Space Shuttle would be [(engine image)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c3/1a/83/c31a837f32a237a7f62e9b003970eb49.jpg). Now the point here is that we never ever see anything this complex arising in nature anywhere. It never happens, and yet we are asked to believe without evidence that it happened with life.

_This third argument is the one that will probably be attacked most easily. Perhaps someone could rephrase it to make it more watertight, but even so, you get the idea. It is inconceivable and against every recorded observation in the history of science to assume that this sort of complexity just arises by itself. This argument will probably be attacked as ""an argument from ignorance"". This is how most critiques of evolution are dealt with. Take it or leave it as you will, but I hope that at least a few people think about it._

Most YECs seem to believe that there were far fewer kinds of animals on the ark than there are species today, because diversification within kinds has occurred since the flood. [For example.](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/ )

However, if lions, cheetahs and domestic cats, for instance, are all one kind, why do we observe all of them in the historical record as far as it goes? All of these animals are referenced by the Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians (conventionally third millennium BCE). Surely we'd expect to see less diversity within kinds as we go further back? 

(Particularly given that the conventional evolutionary time line postulates a time depth of 15 million years between lions and domestic cats.)

Same with sheep and goats, for instance. You can go as far back as you like, the historical record consistently seems to make the distinction. Likewise, mules (horse-donkey hybrids) are mentioned far back into antiquity, along with sources specifically describing them as sterile. This surely implies substantial micro-evolution had already occurred.

Do YECs believe there to be any cases where the historical record does blur the distinction within kinds? If not, is this a problem for the YEC model? And if not, how do YECs explain it?",13,1561677589,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c6ckq9/why_dont_we_observe_postflood_microevolution/

Why the differences?,"_Here's  [lovely graphic!](https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html) that summarizes the simple differences. What follows is a more detailed look at the differences between DNA and RNA that I researched 6 years ago. I hope that you find it interesting and that you can see evidence of very clever design in these molecules._

#DNA vs. RNA. Why the differences?

##DNA uses deoxyribose in its backbone. RNA uses ribose.  Why?

* When ribose is in the sugar-phosphate chain, the molecule is more flexible. Because RNA is single stranded and more flexible than DNA, RNA can bend and bond with itself. This in vital in tRNA as well as rRNA (ribosomal RNA) where it is the shape of the molecule that is important, not the sequence of bases as in mRNA.
* Ribose has an extra  OH group which prevents RNA from being wound into stable double helixes.  (ref1)
* It is important that DNA is double stranded because it is much more stable than a single stranded molecule would be and the double stranded-ness allows for error correction and repair.
* It is important that RNA is single stranded so that it can be read by ribosomes. RNA doesn’t have to be extremely stable. It is destroyed after a while and new RNA is made from DNA when needed.



## RNA uses Uracil as the partner to Adenine, while DNA uses Thymine to pair with Adenine. Why?

* Thymine takes more energy to synthesize. It is not used in RNA because there is no need for it, while there is a need for it in DNA.
* Uracil prefers to bond with Adenine, but it “can base-pair with almost any other base, including itself, depending on how it situates itself in the helix.” (ref2)   Thymine will only pair with adenine – making DNA duplication more efficient and less prone to errors (than RNA duplication)
* Thymine is simply methylated uracil. The methyl group makes the DNA unrecognizable to enzymes which break down DNA and RNA. The methyl group is also hydrophobic which forces thymine more to the centre of the double helix, protecting the base pairs from the outside environment.
* Cytosine can deaminate to form uracil. If Uracil were used in DNA, then one couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be there or if it was a mutation from cytosine. Since uracil is never in DNA, anytime it occurs, it is a mistake. If a C changes to a U in RNA, it is not such a problem, because the protein made simply won’t work and it will be destroyed. RNA has a much shorter lifetime than DNA, the error won’t be around for a long period.

* If cytosine deamination does occur in DNA and the DNA is transcribed, Uracil will code for the complementary base Adenine, just as T does. Note that all 3 of the stop codons  will be unaffected by cytosine deamination. (ref3)  [Image](https://imgur.com/RBHUl3K)

Michael Denton in his: 'Evolution: Still a Theory in Crisis' discusses a problem with this belief on pages 242 and 243:

'One aspect of the transition is certainly hard to account for in adaptive terms: the final stages in the reduction of the hind limbs from tiny but almost complete hind limbs to mere vestigial remnants in most modern whales.^1 These final stages of their elimination, when the reduced limbs were entirely encased in the immensity of the whale's body, are obviously problematical. As Gould comments:

'What conceivable pressure of natural selection could account for gradual stages in the disappearance of a *functionless organ* - for loss of function should remove a structure from the domain of selection entirely, and knowledge about an eventually adaptive state could not be invoked to guide an explanation for intermediary states along such a functionless path.'^2

The reduction of the whale hind limbs troubled the great Darwinist August Weismann, who debated the issue with Herbert Spencer in the 1980s. As Spencer points out in his correspondence, a Greenland Right Whale, weighing 44,800 pounds, has a femur which weighs only three and a half ounces, and a Razorback (Finback) weighing 56,000 pounds, has a femur of one ounce, ""so that these vanishing remnants of hind limbs weighed but 1/896,000 part of the animal"".^3 Weismann was forced to concede the point:

'To use Herbert Spencer's striking illustration, **how could the balance between life and death, in the case of a colossus like the Greenland whale, be turned one way or another by the difference of a few inches in the length of the hind-leg**...Further reduction to their modern state of great degeneration and absolute concealment within the flesh of the animal cannot be referred even to negative selection.'^4 (Emphasis mine)

Creation,c2yc2s,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,Genetic Entropy and Devolution: A Brief Comparison and Contrast,"It is easy to confuse the two, but John Sanford's idea of genetic entropy and Michael Behe's idea of devolution are distinct and complimentary arguments against evolution.

Both are similar in that they point out the inability of a mindless process like evolution to create anything approaching a complex  living system.  

And both are similar in that they demonstrate how evolution is a dead end.

But here is how they differ.  Sanford (genetic entropy) does not believe there are very many truly neutral mutations; he thinks the vast majority are damaging.  However, he believes that most of the damage is so slight (from any given mutation) that it is invisible to selection until a large amount has accumulated.  Once it reaches a critical level, the species collapses from a variety of causes, all arising from the degraded genome. 

So Sanford focus on the damaging mutations that selection *misses.*  By contrast, Behe (devolution) focuses on the damaging mutations that *are* actually selected for their immediate survival value.  The effect of this process, over time, will be to lose genetic variety, locking each species more and more tightly into its respective niche (and thus making it less and less adaptable to changing circumstances).  I just did a [more detailed explanation here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c25yix/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/)

Behe actually believes in neutral mutations, but devolution only concerns itself with the functional part of the genome, so his idea holds whether or not there are such things.

By contrast, genetic entropy depends on the idea that there are not very many truly neutral mutations.  In other words, it depends on the idea that most of the genome is functional and that randomly scrambling the genome by mutation is bad.  Given the fact that ENCODE has found that 80% of the genome has demonstrable function, I think his theory is on solid ground as well.",55,1561048980,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c2yc2s/genetic_entropy_and_devolution_a_brief_comparison/

Creation,c25yix,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,"Darwin Devolves: Summary of the Argument against Evolution, Part One","
In *Darwin Devolves,* Michael Behe concerns himself with three factors: natural selection, random mutation, and irreducible complexity.  In this post, I will address his argument using natural selection and random mutation.

Natural selection acting on random mutation can give rise, relatively quickly, to a fair amount of phenotypical variation in a population, the sort and degree that could be classified as speciation.  But evolution soon hits a wall, ironically, because of these same two factors.  The reason is this.
  
There are thousands of ways for random mutations in the functional part of the genome to break or damage a gene, but only a very few to “improve it constructively.” 
 
Breaking or damaging a gene can be beneficial to survival.

And improving a gene constructively can be beneficial to survival.

However, “the rate of appearance of a beneficial mutation that breaks or degrades a gene is expected to be **hundreds to thousands of times faster** than a beneficial mutation that has to change a specific nucleotide in a gene [i.e., one that improves it constructively].""  (Emphasis mine) 

Thus, “damaging mutations will almost always occur first and so have the first opportunity, well before constructive mutations, to be positively selected if they are helpful.”  If such damaging mutations become fixed in a population, they are highly unlikely to be reversed.

This squandering of genetic inheritance for short-term survival gains *can only result, overall, in a downward net trend in genotypic variety,* and a *downward* trend means **evolution cannot account for the complex machinery of life.**  Even if you allow for the simple and rare constructive increase of function (and Behe does) that little gain is swamped by massive losses due to the beneficial destruction of function that are positively selected.  And the little gain itself also becomes a potential target for future destruction.  

Paradoxically, this loss of function can account for relatively rapid speciation and noticeable variation in phenotypes.  For instance, the useful whiteness of a polar bear is due to a damaged gene, as are the blunter, shorter beaks of Galapagos finches.  Degradative changes are also largely responsible for the differences in dog breeds.

This leads Behe to conclude that evolution can account very nicely for differences at the level of genus and species, but no more.  Differences at the level of family and beyond require intentional engineering, not the mindless scrambling and deletion of genetic information we see in Darwin’s mechanisms.  We need net *increase* of function, not a net *loss.*  (As a side note, although Behe obviously believes in intelligent design, he also believes in common descent; however, those who do not believe in common descent usually identify the biblical “kind” as a rough designation of what we call “family” in biological taxonomy.)
  
This also explains why classifying life at the level of genus and species is so notoriously difficult.  He even cites George Barlow as saying that some biologists are proposing that we do away with the binomial nomenclature of genus and species.  Behe concludes,
*“Species and genus classifications seem ephemeral likely because they are based on accidental attributes-on the caprice of random mutation and natural selection-which can arise through any number of serendipitous paths.  Classifications at the level of family and beyond, on the other hand, are much more well-grounded, because they very likely are based…consciously or unconsciously-on the apprehension of a purposeful arrangement of parts, that is, on the aspects of the intentional design of the organism.”*",22,1560882821,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c25yix/darwin_devolves_summary_of_the_argument_against/

Creation,byg01z,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,Darwin Devolves: Introduction,"I'm reading *Darwin Devolves* by Michael Behe, and I thought it would be useful and fun for me to share some of my favorite parts as I go along.  I don't intend to do a proper summary of each part, just to highlight what I thought was most interesting or insightful.

The first part is essentially a brief history of ID, beginning in antiquity.  He notes very rightly, that

""all particular positions on the topic can be considered to
be elaborations on either of just two general mutually exclusive views: 

(1) contemporary nature, including people, is an accident;

(2) contemporary nature, especially people, is largely intended—the product of a preexisting reasoning mind."" 

For me the most interesting part follows this.  It is a short bio.  He head us this part by recounting a time when he ""opened an academic journal called *Biology &amp; Philosophy* and spotted this sentence: **“To see the point quite palpably, note that Stalin, or Osama bin Laden, or Michael Behe, or your favorite villain is also . . .”** The man who included me in that rogues gallery was Alexander Rosenberg, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University.""  Behe's reasons for bringing this up are two-fold: 

One, it is a typical example of the sort of socially sanctioned bullying that he and all proponents of ID are subjected to. 

Two: It is the segue to the story of his journey to ID.  What I found most interesting was that, being raised a Catholic, he completely embraced naturalistic abiogenesis and evolution.  Only after reading *Evolution: A Theory in Crisis* by Michael Denton did he realize, 

""I had never heard any of my teachers critique Darwin's theory in all of my science studies.""

He goes on to say,

""At that point I concluded that I had been led to believe in Darwin’s theory not because of strong evidence for it. Rather, it was for sociological reasons—that simply was the way educated people were expected to think these days. My professors hadn’t been intentionally misleading—that was the framework in which they thought about life too. But from then on I resolved to decide for myself what the evidence showed.  *When one starts to treat Darwinism as a hypothesis about the biochemical level of life rather than as an assumption, it takes about ten minutes to
conclude it’s radically inadequate. It takes perhaps another ten minutes to realize that the molecular foundation of life was designed...""*

Creation,bw2ia1,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,"Summary of findings about evolutionists and their view on ""bad design""","A week ago I posted some questions on /r/debateEvolution to try and understand what’s going on with the idea of “bad design”.  It turns out that there is a wide spectrum of opinion among evolutionists.

_*Evolutionists is a short form for people, many of whom are atheists, who believe that evolution explains how life came to be the way we see it now, the origin of species and all that. It’s not meant to be pejorative._


[The questions are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bt840r/confusion_about_evolution_and_bad_design/), abbreviated below: 

1. Does evolution automatically include the idea that nature is badly designed? Is the idea that nature is badly designed an intrinsic part of evolutionary theory? 
2. If you say that something in nature is badly designed, then one would expect that you could also detect the opposite. As someone who believes in evolution, is it possible to see things that are well designed as well as things that are badly designed? If not, why not?
3. Is everything in nature badly designed?
4. If not, can you give some examples of things in nature that we well designed?
5. If someone answers the above question and states some features of nature that are well designed, does this then mean that they are a creationist or does this mean that evolution is false? Do other evolution advocates see them as a traitor to evolution if they say that something is well designed?
6. Biomimetics is the field of engineering where we copy designs from nature to improve our products. If nature only has bad designs why would we be copying them? How do we improve our products by adding bad design to them?


## First of all, some universals:

We should all note that creationists have really poisoned the well on this one. A very common response is to have a knee-jerk reaction against the word “design”. Examples: 

*  Creationists don't usually debate in good faith and love to sneak in terminology in other descriptions
* Saying something is ""designed"" you are sneaking in a ""designer"" because design naturally requires a designer the same way a painting requires a painter, and that's why people are arguing with you.
* The term “design” is best avoided because it’s misleading; it suggests the existence of a designer that we don’t postulate.

Obviously, evolution does not believe in a designer. Hopefully we are all aware of that basic fact. However, I think that there is still reason enough to use word “design” and that, hopefully, we’ve progressed past the juvenile stage of “Hey, you said ‘design’, you must believe in God. Gotcha.”  If an ID-proponent wants to use this sort of argument, from ‘design’ to ‘designer’ then they should be up-front about what they are doing and how they are arguing.

Another universal: all the groups seemed to agree that if one of their colleagues used the word “design” when referring to nature, then that doesn’t automatically mean that they have abandoned evolution. This is a good and sensible response – even from the group who would not be caught dead using the d-word themselves.

## Here are the different groups, different viewpoints, that I’ve seen in the responses.

**Group 1.** There are a lot of evolutionists for whom the word “design” is a red flag and they absolutely will not use it because (for some people) it necessarily implies a designer. Thus, discussing whether a fingernail is well-designed or not is like asking if a fingernail is kyenwwmgo or quenglanckly.  

Dialogue? Any discussion about it is useless. But this is not a problem if someone in this group clearly states their position so no one is wasting time debating things that don’t exist.  Note that the person discussing with them has to be able to actually listen as well, in order to understand that this is the position of the evolutionist.

Logical contradictions: (i) none at all. Unless (ii) they are part of the group that argues that things are badly designed. Group 1 cannot say that anything is badly designed because they don’t believe in design and won’t use that word.

**Group 1b.** This group might be the same as the first. This group doesn’t believe in design, or in ever using the word design, but does not clearly state their position and actually tries to argue about design.  This ends up with a very confusing discussion with neither side able to understand the other. This seems to be the group that claims to not understand my questions (though they are straightforward), and when I reply to things, say that I obviously didn’t understand anyone’s responses. It’s very frustrating and reminds me of when a Hindu devotee was trying to explain Hinduism to me. I understood all of the words, but the sentences and the ideas made no sense to me. 

Dialogue? It’s a total waste of time discussion design with this group as no one will get anywhere.

Logical contradictions: If you don’t believe that ‘design’ can be used in a sentence referring to nature, then don’t argue about design. If you have some non-standard redefinition of ‘design’ so that you can use it when referring to nature, then you better make sure that whoever you are talking with understands this and can follow what you’re saying. It’s better to chose a word that reflects what you mean rather than redefining existing words.

**Group 2.** There are evolutionists who are able to discuss design in nature. This group is able to make the mental translation from “bad design” to “if this were a product of design, then it was done badly.” I’m not sure what the translation of “good design” would be.

**Group 2a** Their take is that there is no design in nature. No good designs, no bad designs.  (I’m not really sure if this should be group 2a or is just another facet of group 1.)

Dialogue? There doesn’t seem to be any point discussing design with them.

Logical contradictions: trying to talk about bad design when there are no designs in nature.

** Group 2b**. There are a LOT of evolutionists who talk quite vehemently about bad designs.  They seem to be able to use “design” in discussion and in making their points. However, they believe that everything is badly designed. There are no good designs in nature. Evolution automatically implies bad design. 

Dialogue? Since this seems to be a philosophical belief, it won’t be changed by any discussion or argument. Talking with these people is totally useless because they won’t acknowledge any points that don’t agree with their foundational a priori belief. You can’t change someone’s inherent belief by arguing with them.

Logical contradictions: (i) not being able to define bad design clearly (e.g. a bat flies but doesn’t have feathers, ergo, it’s a bad design. We only have one opposable thumb on our hand, two would be better, ergo, bad design). (ii) How can something be defined as bad if there is no good to compare it to? (iii) Biomimetics (question 6).


**Group 2c.** There is a group of evolutionists who can talk about design and also who do not believe that evolution automatically implies bad design. Yay! They will say that some things in nature are well designed and some are badly designed. They are able to look at design from an impersonal, detached viewpoint. They don’t feel the need to automatically start discussing the characteristics of the purported designer or bring metaphysics and religion into the discussion. Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed that they’ve given many actual examples of good design in nature, DNA and tardigrades are two that I’ve heard in these discussions.

Dialogue?  Great. This is the group that I would want to discuss design with.

Creation,bvph6d,Rayalot72,Evolutionist/Philosophy nerd,t2_ofntq,self.Creation,,"""Historical Science"" Doesn't Seem to Reach Skepticism of those Encompassed Conclusions","Much of this rhetoric seems to originate from Ken Ham, but it doesn't seem to be very rigorous, nor does granting the distinction seem to give us any reason to reject what falls under historical science.  

I will primarily base everything here on what I remember from what Ken Ham has said, and what I could pick out from this article on AIG: https://answersingenesis.org/what-is-science/two-kinds-of-science/

So, it would seem that the argument is that the methodology used between ""observational science"" and ""historical science"" differs.  Scientists working on something that falls into one category are doing something fundamentally different to what scientists working on something in the other category are doing.  This brings us to...

**Problem 1:** Why would the fact that these two categories operate using different methods mean that we should reject one of those categories?  

Certainly, we use different methods for different tasks all of the time, so it would seem we'd need additional reason to think that there's a problem with one of our methods rather than the categories themselves.  Ham, however, fails to explain what this is.  He seems to reject everything that isn't direct experience arbitrarily.  The only other thing he'll allow for is historical reference, since it's related to direct experiences, but then we're left with the second problem of how Ham decides that a historical record of any kind is reliable.  

It's fairly obvious that some historical records are, in actuality, unreliable, biased, or even deceptive.   How do we decide how any particular document relates to truth?  It seems as if Ham would be forced to start providing other methods of evaluation, which is equivalent to handing out the means to his own destruction, since these methods might easily be used to defend what he categorizes as historical science.  This is similar to another difficulty Ham faces...

**Problem 2:** Are there actually fundamental differences between how observational and historical science are carried out, or are many of the basic methods in use identical?  

Some of the main categories of inference:

All of these inevitably interact with some forms of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic).

[Deductive Inference:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning)

&gt;Deductive reasoning, also deductive logic, logical deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.  Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.

[Inductive Inference:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)

&gt;Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conclusion; this is in contrast to deductive reasoning. While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be probable, based upon the evidence given.

This interacts quite a bit with formal systems like [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics).

[Abductive Inference:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning)

&gt;Abductive reasoning (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation for the observations. This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it. Abductive conclusions are thus qualified as having a remnant of uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as ""best available"" or ""most likely"". One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all uses of the terms abduction and inference to the best explanation are exactly equivalent.

It would seem that all of these are used fairly often by scientists in both observational and historical science.  

Observational Deduction:

OP1. If the unknown substance U is gold, then it will conduct electricity, be malleable, and melt at about 1337.5 K.  

OP2. U conducts electricity, is malleable, and melts at about 1337.5 K. 

OC1. U is gold.  

Historical Deduction:

HP1. If carbon dating sample S gives us an age that is within carbon dating's range (suppose this is under 50,000 years) and S is not contaminated, then S is that age.  

HP2. S is not contaminated. 

HP3. Carbon dating S gives an age of approximately 25,000 years. 

HC1. S is approximately of the age 25,000. 

Observational Induction:

Every time we do something to matter, and we measure its mass, before and after acting on it, the total mass of the measured system remains the same.  This gives us reason to think that there is something about the universe that conserves mass.  

Historical Induction: 

Whenever we look at fossils, there are certain characteristics unique to those which formed from organisms that had feathers.  This gives us reason to think that dinosaur and ancient bird-like fossils which share these characteristics also formed from organisms that had feathers.  

Observational Abduction: 

Our understanding of how gravity works indicates that certain galactic bodies are behaving oddly for their know mass, so it would seem a good explanation is for there to be more mass present than we are able to detect.  

Historical Abduction: 

When volcanoes erupt, they leave certain types of deposits due to ash, lava, and other volcanic phenomenon.  It would then seem reasonable to say that, when we see other cases of these deposits in geology, they are due to volcanic activity.",0,1559422700,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bvph6d/historical_science_doesnt_seem_to_reach/

Creation,bsarjr,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,James Tour ... some problems in his video,"Someone posted this video on this subreddit or one of the other creation/evolution debate ones: https://youtu.be/zU7Lww-sBPg?t=2679

It's entitled ""James Tour: The Mystery of the Origin of Life"".

I watched it and he is dynamic and bang on. I think that the one that he did for the Pascal lectures at UWaterloo was a bit better though. 

I had problems with two of his accusations about other scientists:

1. At 44:39 he starts attacking Jack Szostak, and yes, step 5 is a ludicrous leap in logic. But just wait ... at 45:19 he shows a diagram that is completely wrong. He says that Szostak, ""a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and one of the recipients of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine"" is **totally lying** in this diagram. NO! This is not the full story. Look up the original publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05098-w  **Now look at the diagram. It is done by a Matthew Twombly.** Who is this guy and who allowed him to put total crap diagrams into Nature? Does anyone know, how would we even find out? Tour is really crossing the line saying that Szostak is lying when the diagram could have been added by the publisher AFTER his paper was accepted.   I do not know the nitty gritty of scientific publishing. Can anyone shed light on this? The problem still remains, that Nature is putting totally wrong diagrams in their publications, but it might not be Szostak's fault.

2. At 49:12 he shows a slide of a quote from https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2202 . But, from what I can tell, Tour is reading the quote incorrectly. He reads the slide and omits the first word ""That"". 
 What exactly is the full quote? Is it the whole screen or just part of it. We have to look up the journal because it is so unclear.

Here it is: _""We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry.""_

So Tour probably is correct, but he is inaccurate and misleading. The authors (Sutherland is only one of many and not the first) say clearl that they show that the PRECUSORS CAN BE DERIVED.  They go on to claim and THUS (ie. supposition, not proven) ... COULD HAVE ...  Tour needs to be accurate in his quote. They did not say exactly what he has on his screen because he is just showing a fragment.

""cellular subsystems"" occurs once in the article, ""subsystems"" occurs nine other times, and ""precursors"" occurs 32 times. The article is about precursors, NOT cellular subsystems and the title even says that ""Common origins of RNA, protein and lipid precursors in a cyanosulfidic protometabolism""  I think that Tour's criticism of this paper is unsupported.

-----------------
I just thought that maybe this would be worth noting. I hope that someone calls him on this so that he can improve his presentations in the future.",11,1558660042,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bsarjr/james_tour_some_problems_in_his_video/

Creation,brq9pk,Cepitore,,t2_wqzeg5,self.Creation,,Babies Don’t Seem a Product of Evolution,"I’ve heard it argued that it’s beneficial for human babies to remain helpless for so many years because the resulting adult is so much more adept at survival as a result that the overall survival of the human is higher. This sounds reasonable at first, but becomes hard for me to believe when considering certain traits babies have that appear to be 100% maladaptive.

Babies are incredibly fragile. I would expect that with how helpless they are, that they would have at least naturally become more resilient to injuries sustained from either falling down, or having things fall on themselves. Babies are incredibly prone to hitting their heads, yet have very poorly protected brains.

Babies have zero understanding of toxic substances, and also have much trouble swallowing solid objects, and yet they put any and everything they can into their mouth. They have no instinctual caution when it comes to poison, illness, or choking. There are over 12,000 ER visits in the US each year for child choking related injuries. Imagine how it would have been in ancient times where nothing was childproof and babies were putting much less sanitary things in their mouths.

Babies cry... a lot. There is virtually no benefits to crying from a survival perspective, and many potential dangers, more so especially if considering ancient times.",27,1558539489,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/brq9pk/babies_dont_seem_a_product_of_evolution/

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago I excitedly subscribed to /r/Creation after discovering the subreddit's existence as a long time lurker and fan of comments made by  /u/JoeCoder (now /u/JohnBerea) and others (e.g. /u/StCordova) on Reddit which they had posted elsewhere. My hope was that by subscribing to /r/Creation I would be all the more ready with an answer for the hope that is in me in accordance with 1 Peter 3:15. I supposed that if I were able to prove the existence of the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible to the lost souls I engaged in heated debate with online, those people would have no choice but to repent and be saved.

&amp;#x200B;

The findings of Creation research I read here were great talking points in conversations I'd have with the lost souls I encountered online. It would be some time before I understood that proof, or even probability, couldn't produce faith and repentance. Particularly in light of Romans 10:17.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Romans 10:9-17 (KJV)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**9** That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**10** For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  
&gt;  
&gt;**11** For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  
&gt;  
&gt;**12** For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  
&gt;  
&gt;**13** For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**14** How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  
&gt;  
&gt;**15** And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  
&gt;  
&gt;**16** But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  
&gt;  
&gt;**17** So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I supposed, it might help.

&amp;#x200B;

I continued reading quality posts submitted to /r/Creation with great interest. Then I read an [article](http://libcfl.com/articles/13.htm) written by Curtis A. Pugh, which though I had no knowledge of the church which published it, nor affiliation with that church or the author of the article, I found to be true after searching the Holy Scriptures cited therein.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;13 Things a Lost Person Cannot Do  
&gt;  
&gt;by Curtis A. Pugh  
&gt;  
&gt;*That the lost sinner must cast himself wholly on the mercy and grace of God must be obvious to those who read and believe the Scriptures. But the Bible knows nothing of such foolish man-made ideas as ""praying the sinner's prayer"", or ""making a decision for Christ"", or ""inviting Jesus into your heart"" or ""going forward to receive Christ."" No New Testament preacher ever used such terms or tactics! To tell spiritually dead sinners that there is something they can do to bring about their salvation is damnable heresy for by its false hope sinners are taught to trust in what they have done rather in Christ who has done all.*   
&gt;  
&gt;**Consider these thirteen spiritual things an unsaved person cannot do:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**1. HE CANNOT THINK AS GOD DOES**:   
&gt;  
&gt;*""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth,* ***so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts***\*.""\* (Isaiah 55:8-9)  
&gt;  
&gt;**2. HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND GOD:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*"". . . thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself . . .*"" (Psalm 50:21)   
&gt;  
&gt;*""Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as heaven;* ***what canst thou do?*** *Deeper than hell;* ***what canst thou know?****""* (Job 11:7-8)  
&gt;  
&gt;**3. HE CANNOT SEE SPIRITUAL THINGS:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again* ***he cannot see*** *the kingdom of God.""* (John 3:3)  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. HE CANNOT KNOW HIS OWN HEART:**   
&gt;  
&gt;*""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:* ***who can know it?****""*(Jeremiah 17:9)  
&gt;  
&gt;**5. HE CANNOT PROPERLY DIRECT HIS OWN PATHS:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself:* ***it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps***\*.""\* (Jeremiah 10:23)   
&gt;  
&gt;*""There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.""* (Proverbs 14:12)  
&gt;  
&gt;**6. HE CANNOT FREE HIMSELF FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written,* ***Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them***\*.""\* (Galatians 3:10)  
&gt;  
&gt;**7. HE CANNOT RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Even the Spirit of truth;* ***whom the world cannot receive***\*, because it seeth him not . . .""\* (John 14:17)  
&gt;  
&gt;**8. HE CANNOT HEAR (receive &amp; understand) GOD'S WORDS:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""He that is of God heareth God's words;* ***ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God***\*.""\* (John 8:47)  
&gt;  
&gt;*""But the natural* (unsaved) *man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:* ***neither can he know them*** *because they are spiritually discerned.""* (1Corinthians 2:14)  
&gt;  
&gt;**9. HE CANNOT BIRTH HIMSELF INTO THE FAMILY OF GOD:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh* ***nor of the will of man****but of God.""* (John 1:13)  
&gt;  
&gt;*""For he saith to Moses,* ***I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion***\*. So then\* ***it is not of him that willeth***\*, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.""\* (Romans 9:15-16)  
&gt;  
&gt;**10. HE CANNOT PRODUCE REPENTANCE AND FAITH IN CHRIST:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that (faith) not of yourselves:* ***it is the gift of God: Not of works***\*, lest any man should boast.""\* (Ephesians 2:8-9)  
&gt;  
&gt;*"". . . for all men have not faith.""* (2 Thessalonians 3:2)  
&gt;  
&gt;*""For unto you* ***it is given*** *. . . to believe on him . . .""* (Philippians 1:29)  
&gt;  
&gt;*"". . . if God peradventure* ***will give them repentance*** *. . .""* (2 Timothy 2:25)  
&gt;  
&gt;*"". . . to them that have* ***obtained*** *like precious faith with us . . .""* (2 Peter 1:1)  
&gt;  
&gt;**11. HE CANNOT COME TO CHRIST:**  
&gt;  
&gt;***""No man can come to me***, *except the Father which hath sent me draw him . . . Therefore said I unto you, that* ***no man can come unto me***\*, except it were given unto him of my Father.""\* (John 6:44, 65)  
&gt;  
&gt;**12. HE CANNOT BELIEVE ON CHRIST:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""But ye believe not,* ***because ye are not of my sheep*** *as I said unto you.""* (John 10:26)  
&gt;  
&gt;**13. HE CANNOT PLEASE GOD:**  
&gt;  
&gt;*""For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. . . .* ***So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God***\*. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.""\*(Romans 8:5, 8, 9)  
&gt;  
&gt;**SO THEN, MANKIND IS SHUT UP TO THE FACT OF HIS OWN TOTAL INABILITY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT HIS LOST CONDITION.**

&amp;#x200B;

It would be a long time until  I understood that it wouldn't help. Surely,  though it might not help, it couldn't hurt. Truly, even those with eyes to see may only see now through a mirror dimly (1 Corinthians 13:12). I am no exception!

&amp;#x200B;

While scientific proof for the existence of God undoubtedly exists, the lost already have this proof of a Creator in creation and are without excuse. As it is written:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Romans 1:20 (KJV)**  
&gt;  
&gt;For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

&amp;#x200B;

Using the idol of Scientism, one of the countless false gods of this world, will do nothing to accomplish something the Word of God can't. It can't save someone who be not a son of peace (Luke 10), it can't produce faith and repentance in a lost person, nor in the present day [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system) of biology research and gender identity can it coerce a lost person to concede their point of view or merit acknowledgement.

&amp;#x200B;

I see many folks who do not realize in their labor and zeal they have fashioned a golden calf in their pursuit of Creation Research. Many people devote more of their time to these pursuits than they devote to fulfilling the Great Commandment. They hope to have better success preaching scientific research than the gospel of Jesus Christ as they labor in the Great Commission. Yet it is written that without Him we can do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

What shall we say then? Shall we rebuke the Lord? Peter made that mistake before (Matthew 16:22) and I suspect many of us have, too. For myself, I've decided that while the subject of Creation Research is of some peripheral interest to me presently, it is better to worship the Creator rather than creation (to include its research of itself). As for my evangelism efforts online, however, creation research won't be included even as an honorable mention. God's Word gives us a better way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **1 Corinthians 2:2 (KJV)**   
&gt;  
&gt;For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you fellow sojourners reading this post, I would encourage you to judge righteous judgement and examine yourselves. Search the Scriptures and see if these things I've written are so.

Spore was a video game about evolution.  Interestingly, you would design your character as it evolved on a planet populated by creatures designed by other players.  Video games that attempt to emulate living ecosystems are be (possibly poor) examples of created worlds.  

Does this provide any incite into determining design versus evolved organisms? (I intend for this to be a more speculative discussion than a hard one)

Many spore creatures look similar because of the toolkit used to create them, without knowing they were made by players, similar creatures could be assumed to be evolved from common ancestors. Some creatures I made were created from the same base design, and would very similar.  

This game would be an example of multiple designers using the same toolkit with a goal in mind.  Players come up with solutions for making effective creatures, potentially coming to the same conclusions.  This would lead to designs that are analogous with convergent evolution.

Creation,bgtb66,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Complexity and engineering make life unlikely,"Here's an interesting quote from studies on complexity in engineering and society:

&gt; The emphasis on simplicity comes from the work of Charles Perrow, a sociologist at Yale University whose 1984 book, Normal Accidents: Living With High-Risk Technologies, tells it all in the very title. Perrow argues that system failure is a normal outcome in any system that is very complex and whose components are “tightly bound”—meaning that the behavior of one component immediately controls the behavior of another. Though such failures may seem to stem from one or another faulty part or practice, they must be seen as inherent in the system itself. They are “normal” failures.

&gt; Nowhere is this problem more acutely felt than in systems designed to augment or improve safety. Every increment, every increase in complexity, ultimately leads to decreasing rates of return and, finally, to negative returns. Trying to patch and then repatch such a system in an attempt to make it safer can end up making it less safe.

(source: https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer)

When you apply this idea to something like the cell, which is incredibly complex and tightly integrated, well, one cannot conceive of how something so complex and stable can have arisen by chance (unless you perform some sort of intellectual lobotomy that is). Cells not only grow, reproduce, respond to the environment, have multiple ways of cellular respiration depending on the food supply, they can also heal themselves, and then in multicellular organisms the complexity becomes insane as they take on different complementary and vital roles and exchange chemical messengers with cells in another distant part of the body.  This fantastically complex system is far beyond our abilities to create, and something this complex should be failing repeatedly (based on what we know about complexity). Yet it doesn't. It is very stable and self regulating and healing. Amazing!",29,1556104389,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bgtb66/complexity_and_engineering_make_life_unlikely/
Creation,bgqagn,Sclooper,,t2_zerr1,self.Creation,,Possible ways to test for a created universe that has not been widely discussed,"Hello r/creation , as a disclaimer I myself am not a strong proponent of creation (I am an evolutionary biologist, please be nice), but I believe there are some fascinating discussions to have on the topic.   

 There are many disparate schools of thought concerning creation.  One of those that does not often see discussion here are the predictions made by a simulated universe hypothesis.  A simulated universe is equivalent in meaning to a created universe, albeit with fewer connotations.  Predictions made by such hypotheses can be tested to provide evidence in support of or against these claims. .

For instance some of these physical predictions are outlined in  [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/i2014-14148-0](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epja/i2014-14148-0)  which suggests that (sorry if I word this wrong, I am no physicist, so my understanding/explanation may be a little off) finding anisotropy in cosmic rays would provide some support for a simulated universe.  Testing simulation is an active field of research in physics, information science and philosophy.

Do you have any thoughts or ideas on this? Can we think of what we would expect from a created universe independent of doctrine? What about with doctrine? 

Interesting to note that a created universe is a different idea than the creation of life, which in the case of a created universe could be incidental or intentional depending on the nature of that creation. Additionally, in a non-simulated universe, creation of life still remains a possibility.  I'm going off topic so I'll save this for a later discussion.",67,1556079884,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bgqagn/possible_ways_to_test_for_a_created_universe_that/

Creation,bg3k7w,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Eyelashes - a mystery for evolution?,"We, and many mammals, have eyelashes at the ends of both eyelids. The length of the eyelash is appropriate for the size of the eyeball. We actually have 3-5 rows of eyelashes.

Now, how could they evolve? Well, one assumes that due to the random nature of evolution, it's likely that many things are slowly evolving at the same time. So while random mutations are making eyelashes appear in random places on the body, the animal is also developing more critical things like an immune system, thicker fur for insulation, adaptive colouring for the various seasons, warm-bloodedness, etc. All of these things are going to have a huge survival advantage whereas eyelashes don't. So, the eyelashes appearing on the forehead - that's not a do-or-die thing. If you can't outrun your predators then your genes don't make it to the next generation. So that's what determines whether your genome gets passed on to future generations. 

Is some creature at a huge evolutionary disadvantage because it has no eyelashes? No. Will this be the tipping point that causes it to be less fit than it's relatives which have eyelashes? No. What about the length? How did that come about? [They all are an optimal length.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/your-eyelashes-should-be-this-long-science-says/)

Would an animal which has a mutation so that it's eyelashes are a bit too short get killed or die more easily, before it can mate? Absolutely not.

Eyelashes are a clearcut example of intelligent design. They are in exactly the right place and are exactly the right length and curve exactly the right way. If eyelashes had to develop randomly due to evolution, there is no way that this could happen since having eyelashes or not is not a life or death matter.",38,1555947708,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bg3k7w/eyelashes_a_mystery_for_evolution/

Creation,bbddp5,aldostenar,,t2_i1iza24,self.Creation,,Researchers witness the emergence of a new gene in the lab,"Hi guys,  


I just found this article and it is quite interesting.  
Indeed, it validates something creationist have been claiming for years but that evolutionists usually reject. The authors (which are evolutionists) agree on the fact that it has never been proved that a gene duplication followed by mutations could give birth to a ""new"" gene.  
"" According to this theory, the 'extra' gene copy could then evolve  freely. In this way, it could acquire a new function, while the original  gene ensured that the original function was retained. No direct  observation supporting this theory has been reported so far. ""  
So it is nice to see that a classic antievolutionist argument is now validated by an impartial authority.   


Of course, this study doesn't prove anything. Here, the goal is to show that : ""If enough mutations occur in a gene copy, it can develop a completely new function""  
But unfortunatly, all we see here is that a sugar transporter is now able to transport a new kind of sugar ( maltotriose ). So it is not what we could call a ""completely new function"". It's just a recombination of preexisting fonctional modules but no new coding information, no original biochimic activity, no substantial transformation is witnessed here. And by the way, it would be interesting to understand why the initial transporter wasn't able du transport maltotriose... Maybe an active site was hidden by the 3D conformatin of the protein...   


It is also interesting to notice that, as usual, the evolutionists are surprised by the great speed of this adaptation :  
 "" ""For us, the real surprise was how quickly the hybrid gene came into being,"" says Gorter de Vries.""   
Of course, this was expected by creationist who think that organisms are designed to adapt, but it was unpredicted by evolutionist who think that adaptation is ""random"" and guided by ""luck"" and ""try and fall"".   
And finally, it is not the first time that this adapation appears... So luck and randomness have nothing to do with all that !  


So in the end, I found this study very interesting.   


Cheers from France (and sorry for my poor english)

The problem with the current design seems to be limited to choking.

The benefits:

* being able to breathe through nose and/or mouth. This is hugely important (a) for when we sprint (fight or flight -- need more oxygen fast) and (b) if you get a cold, then you don't die of suffocation. The nose needs to be the primary method for breathing as it filters and moistens the air properly, but when we need to, we have a pretty good alternative system.
* being able to smell food as you eat it. Sometimes when I eat something and I want to be really sure of the flavour/scent, I exhale a bit while chewing - then I can more easily tell if the meat is bad or something. I think that this is a pretty important feature too.
* being able to use a snorkel (if we get water in our mouth, we can easily spit it out. i don't see how this would work well if we had a nose-only snorkel :)

Creation,b90qex,crystalized17,YEC SDA Vegan,t2_wjkep,self.Creation,,How would a sinless world work?,"Just curious about everyone's thoughts on this issue.

If the world was ""perfect"" as it came from God's hand, what was the purpose of humans, other than to ""maintain"" and ""enjoy"" this perfection? It's not like we can ""improve"" on God's design ideas.  


**Examples:**

Adam and Eve were likely able to live easily on a raw vegan diet. Cooking would be totally unnessary. You could do it for ""fun"", but it's ultimately pointless and sometimes even detrimental to the nutrition of the food. How do you discern what you're doing to the food is helpful, hurtful, or pointless? You ask the angels/god for cooking advice? XD

&amp;#x200B;

Sports - figure skating. There's nothing natural about skating on a blade or doing a lot of things we do in sports. So are we really ""improving"" our bodies when trying to force it to do unnatural things? There's a lot of injuries that result from the constant trying. But maybe in a ""perfect"" world, we would simply have ""perfect"" judgement for how far we can push ourselves each day?

&amp;#x200B;

I can easily envision a world where everyone is on the same page morally. But I cannot understand how a world that has no struggle or pain involved would work. If there are no ways to ""improve"" or ""challenge"" yourself because everything is already perfect, then what's the point? And how do you avoid making mistakes or having errors in judgement when you're learning? The very nature of learning or improving something means you're bound to make mistakes. How is making a ""mistake"" *(and therefore learning)* even possible in a ""perfect"" world and in a ""perfect"" human being?

&amp;#x200B;

***Revelation 21:4***

***There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.""***

&amp;#x200B;

Are they just talking about emotional pain? That doesn't seem right since it mentions no more death too. People can definitely die trying to push too far in sports. They're ultimately doing something ""healthy"", but make a fatal mistake and end up getting killed or terribly injured.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it makes sense you would always be growing/improving throughout eternity, even if it's somehow done in a ""painless"" manner. Because to sit around and never change or grow for eternity sounds really boring for intelligent creatures.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you struggle for something, but it just doesn't hurt? AKA I'm working on my front splits, and I just can't go down any further today, even though there's no pain associated with it? That seems even more nuts though. Pain is a warning system that you're about to make a serious error in judgement.

Though it would be super nice to have splits not hurt while I'm pushing further, I don't know how else you would be warned about staying where you are for the day.

And the satisfaction that comes from succeeding in these kinds of struggles (body and mind), is worth all of the previous pain.",49,1554311520,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/b90qex/how_would_a_sinless_world_work/

&gt; A world that is procedurally generated is a world that is bland, repetitive, meaningless, boring. Purpose, meaning, interest, and even true beauty come by the mind and careful crafting of a designer. What is true of the virtual world of No Man’s Sky is equally true of the very real world that we inhabit. If there is evidence of purpose, meaning, and interest in this world—and there is in its every part—it stands as evidence, handiwork, of a designer.

Bottom line: Randomness isn't really that random. Of the myriad of options available, most of them look the same. When you generate a video game world with simple rules and a random number generator, you tend to get the same results over and over again. If you want a colorful world with lots of diversity, you need someone to step in and force diversity into the world.

Thus, the diversity of life we see on planet earth, the myriad of ways that creatures survive and thrive on our fallen planet, are a sign of the Creator and Designer, not a random number generator and simple physics.",41,1552679647,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/b1je35/10000_bowls_of_oatmeal/

I'd like to know if I'm missing some.  These are not the sort of things that we don't know simply because we don't have enough knowledge and some researcher could find the answer next year (e.g. what does some particular gene do, or how does it interact with some other gene). No, these are more fundamental problems where there is a logical error,  ... how to describe it ... where the explanations are missing because of logical impossibilities. (maybe someone can explain this better)

1: Origin of life. Note that the RNA world is not an adequate explanation. It fails in so many areas. And the origin of life is something that can't be solved with more study. There is a huge gap between living and non living things and there is no theoretical explanation that can bridge this. A cell needs a boundary, transportation mechanisms across the boundary, metabolism, information storage (templates to manufacture new molecules), reproduction into daughter organisms. All of these things need to come into being at once (except for the cell boundary. One could have a bubble or phosopholipid bilayer, but that's not alive.

2: Origin of viruses. There was an excellent post about this recently.

3: Origin of new body plans, the Cambrian Explosion. Any significant change in developmental regulatory gene networks is fatal to the embyro. Any change later on is minor - eg. long haired vs shorthaired cat.

3b: Origin of tetrapods from fish. The structure of fish fins is nothing like a tetrapod limb. (See [this](https://inference-review.com/article/evolution-a-theory-in-crisis-revisited-part-two) for Tiktaalik limb)

4: Splicosomes. These are complicated intricate molecular machines made up of many parts. This is one of the many examples  of irreducible complexity that evolution can't explain. What's the point of the splicosome if there are no introns to remove? But if the introns came first, with no splicosome, then it would be fatal to the cell. We have to have introns (with all of the signalling information as to where they start and end) and splicosomes appearing simultaneously. 

5: Origin of new genes (?). I think that the only way that genes can occur in evolution is by gene duplication (since random changes are harmful).

6: Origin of new organs like the eye. This might be solved by more research (doubtful), but right now the situation seems to be this: (i) line up all types of eyes from simplest to most complex, (ii) state that the simple ones evolved into complex ones. QED. (iii) Provide no details for which genes change, which new proteins need to arise and in which order this needs to happen. The amount of knowledge that is missing here is staggering.

6b: How the different plumbing of the various reptilian hearts could have evolved without killing the reptiles.

Creation,b025g3,jgardner,,t2_9jd6,self.Creation,,"""Darwin Devolves"" Chapter 1: The Pretense of Knowledge","*This is part of a weekly series discussing ""Darwin Devolves"" by Michael J. Behe. Feel free to get your own copy to read along with us.*

As an introduction to this series of posts, I'd like to lay some ground-suggestions.

1. Please get a copy of the book, read it along with us, and comment appropriately.
2. Share your thoughts, but try to avoid debate. Ask questions to engage someone else's understanding rather than trying to shut them down.
3. Try to pull out quotes or ideas from the book and give them more exposure.

I'm going to offer my own summary below, but feel free to contradict or add your own.

(If you would like to write a summary for a chapter, let me know so we can coordinate.)

---

Chapter 1 covers the question, ""How do we know what we know about evolution?"" It also lays the groundwork for the rest of the book.

He begins talking about Polar Bears, how they are different from Brown Bears by their genes getting damages. He then goes on to connect molecular biology with evolution.

I think it's important that he's not here to debate the fossil record or whatever else people think they know about what happened --- just accept that as a fact and let's talk about the real meat. Which is that Darwin wasn't totally wrong in all his ideas, but one of the central ideas just doesn't match what we observe in the molecules of life. There's no way Darwin could have known these things -- he lived in a time when people thought cells were simple, filled with protoplasm, and he supposed that ""gemmules"" carried the necessary information to the gonads.

Because of recent discoveries, everything that has been said about the mechanism of life and evolution was spoken in ignorance. Not because people weren't smart, but there was no way they could know. It was like talking about the planets and stars before we had telescopes. 

The first step on this journey is epistemology. How do we know what we claim to know?

Economics suffers from ""Physics Envy"". The problem isn't that there aren't enough smart economists, it's that economics is not as simple as physics and relies on things that cannot be accounted for or predicted.

Jerry Coyne once said, ""In science's pecking order, evolutionary biology lurks somewhere near the bottom, far closer to phrenology than to physics."" The author is charitable and compares it with economics, except we cannot yet understand all that is happening in molecular biology so we are still in the dark about much. Unlike economics, though, biology is far more complicated.

It's important, as the author points out, to distinguish the ""what"" from ""how"". We can read the fossil record and see ""what"" happened, but we cannot see ""how"" it happened, and we are no better at understanding the how than economists are at understanding economic systems.

Two sections to gloss over:

* ""Of course!"" Here he points out that you can remove the word ""evolved"" or statements about evolution and you get the same content. ""Evolution"" has become a meaningless word with no substance. IE ""Humans have evolved a sense of self"" vs. ""Humans have a sense of self"". This he calls ""Red Flag #1""
* ""The United Front"": Questioning any tenet of evolution is seen as an assault on evolution itself. Entertaining any doubt about the theory is giving a victory to the ""enemy"". Red Flag #2

Then comes ""Red Flag #3"": The Principle of Comparative Difficulty. This principle simply states that things are harder than other things are harder than other things. So if you get the other thing wrong, you are not likely to get the harder thing right. If you can't make the 5' high jump, you aren't going to make the 20' high jump.

He points out the research on nutrition, and how wrong we have been about fats and and salt, and mentions the 1973 movie ""Sleeper"". If it is so hard to get nutrition right how can we possibly get evolution -- which is so much more complex than nutrition -- right? With nutrition we can run studies and interviews and look at the active chemical processes. With evolution, this is much more difficult.

The sections ""The Hard Limits of Knowledge"" and ""Level of Explanation"" put into words thought that I had had for some time. There was a time when it looked like we would be able to understand everything about physics, but it turns out that some systems are chaotic and unpredictable and never can be tamed. Although we can tell people what happened, and we may even be able to explain the exact sequence of events that lead to it, we may not be able to make predictions.

The Levels of Explanation table on p. 33 is something I want to pin up on my wall at work. As a software developer, so many co-workers think that they live in the ""Regular Direct"" world but the reality is software grows in complexity until we start reasoning about the ""Regular Indirect"" and even ""Manageably Irregular."" There are even problems which I place under ""Hopelessly Irregular.""

The discussion about spandrels and intelligence is very germane to my field, and to our discussion of evolution. ""Spandrel"" comes from a 1979 paper written by Gould and Lewontin arguing that some features that have evolved were not adaptation but merely filled in the gaps between other adaptations. These are things that are not intentional but arise from intentional action -- traffic jams, stock market shifts, etc...

Finally there is the ""Intelligent Causes"", things that happened because someone somewhere wanted it to happen.

The last section seems like an introduction to the next chapters, so I don't think it's worth discussing yet.

Creation,azejeg,HmanTheChicken,Young Earth Creationist,t2_dak76sj,self.Creation,,"Gregory of Nyssa on ""To Every Beast I have Given Every Plant""","I found this quote preparing for a Bible Study, and I thought it would be worth posting here:

&gt;&gt;""We note, however, many wild beasts do not eat fruit. What fruit does the panther eat? What fruit makes the lion strong? But nevertheless these creatures, when submitting to the laws of nature, ate fruits. And likewise, when the man changed his way of life and voided the limits set upon him, the Lord, after the flood, knowing humans were wasteful, allowed them to eat all foods: ""Eat every food as if it were edible plants."" Since humans were allowed this concession, the other animals also received the liberty to eat. So the lion is now a meat-eater, and the vulture looks for carrion. 

&gt;&gt;But vultures were not yet circling above the earth to find carrion when the animals originated; nothing created nor imagined had yet died in order to be food for the vultures. Nature had not yet been divided; everything was completely fresh. Hunters did not capture prey, since people did not yet practice this. The beasts did not tear apart prey, since they were not meat eaters yet... 

&gt;&gt;So was the first creation, and to this creation will be restored after this age. Humans will return to their original creation, rejecting hostility, a life encumbered with care, the slavery of the world to daily worries. Once they have renounced all this, they will return to the utopian life which is not enslaved to the passions of the flesh, which is freedom, the closeness to God, a partaker of the life of the angels."" 

(From Gregory of Nyssa, *On the Origin of Man*)

It sums up pretty well why I'm a Young Earth Creationist, and why it's even worth caring about the issue. It's not just a hermeneutical question - is Genesis 1 literal? It's more about whether God is faithful, loving, just, and what our eventual reward will be like after the end of the world. If the world before the Fall was as messed up as it is now, why think the new heavens and the new earth will be any different?

Creation,ay2871,NesterGoesBowling,God's Word is my jam,t2_6c8rcqr,self.Creation,,[Review] The Fool and the Heretic,"After seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aoia3l/biblegateway_interviews_darrel_falk_biologos_and/) regarding an interview with Creationist Todd Wood and Christian Evolutionist Darrel Falk, I was intrigued about [their new book](https://www.amazon.com/Fool-Heretic-Scientists-Christian-Evolution/dp/0310595436/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=fool+and+heretic&amp;qid=1551887548&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-fkmrnull). So I bought it and read it.

I was half expecting (hoping?) for some really good arguments for Creation and for Evolution, comparing and contrasting the two - but this book, as it turns out, is not about convincing anyone one way or the other; rather, it is about something (possibly) more important: how to understand the mindset of Christians who disagree with you. [The Colossians Forum](https://colossianforum.org) is an organization that investigates how Christians ought to act in the face of conflict. In other words, can Christians who disagree on very important topics (such as origins) have unity in Christ? What does that look like?

Todd and Darrel have demonstrated that yes, Christians can be friends and maintain unity in Christ even when we disagree on important issues, putting the famous phrase [*in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_necessariis_unitas,_in_dubiis_libertas,_in_omnibus_caritas) into practice. Along those lines, the other day I listened to a podcast with Dr. James White and Dr. Michael Brown, who have a very deep and fundamental disagreement on Limited Atonement, yet they are friends and have together debated atheists, Muslims, etc., presenting the essential truths of the gospel brilliantly, and that was really cool to see another example of this kind of unity in Christ.

The book really is about ""taking a walk in the other man's shoes"" and is intended for Christians who (a) can't fathom how anyone can believe Common Descent, or (b) can't fathom how anyone can believe Young Earth (or Age) Creationism. And what I found most interesting is that both of these men love Jesus Christ and became great friends, all while believing that the other is damaging the church with their beliefs about origins, because they believe the other is wrong about how to best reach the proverbial ""Aunt Myrtle"" who isn't a scientist yet is a Christian being confronted with with current evolutionary theory (Modern Synthesis). Todd believes Aunt Myrtle must maintain the highest view of Scripture, and understand that much of what we think we know - some of our current scientific explanations to date - are wrong, whereas Darrel believes Aunt Myrtle must know that there is a way to believe the truth of the Bible and also believe that our current scientific theories are true. Todd believes that compromising the highest view of Scripture is never worth the cost, and Darrel believes that rejecting current scientific theories is not an option.

I (and I'm sure many here) identify with Todd, and it was refreshing to hear this thoughts on these issues - Todd gets treated the same way many of us do (with derision), even though, by Darrel's own admission, Todd knows more about evolutionary theory than he does. I've learned a lot from the book, though the book never addressed how Darrel interprets Hebrews 11 (but I'll write a separate post about that).

Anyway, I thought I'd share this review in hopes that it would help you decide whether or not you'd enjoy reading the book!",35,1551897573,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ay2871/review_the_fool_and_the_heretic/

If we assume hypothetically that the Earth is indeed 6,000 years old, then one or more of the assumptions would have to be wrong. But which ones?

I was thinking about decay rate in particular, and would could possibly make a radioactive element decay faster than normal?

The Bible claims that the Earth was entirely submerged in water over the mountains for something like 6 months. All the water in the oceans weighs about 1,450,000,000,000,000,000 tons. How much would the water weigh as described in the flood account? Would that kind of weight produce enough pressure on the earth’s surface to alter decay rate?

""A continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon was first practiced in Judaism, dated to the 6th century BC at the latest."" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week

 Now, I know it's simple to go from Genesis to the weekly cycle and see a pattern but it's worth considering.  Specially in the light that it has survived along human history this long, and specially when one considered the fact the the Jewish sabbath is on Saturday.  Even when the calendars shifted between Gregorian and Julian the weekly days remained unchanged. Thursday October 4, 1582 was followed by Friday October 15, 1582.  So, if we think of weeks as an unbroken chain of cycles that trace back to original creation week, we can see a solid evidence set in our daily lives. A constant reminder of our creator, a perpetual cycle to serve as witness. Even the 4th commandment reminds us of the purpose of this cycle:

 ""For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.""

An example of a non-credible ""after-the-fact"" probability argument is shuffling a deck of cards and claiming,

&gt;see this sequence of cards is improbable, like 1 out of 51 factorial, God just worked a miracle

Any given shuffle of cards improbably by 1 out of 51 factorial , it doesn't make any given shuffle of cards necessarily evidence of design.

What makes good arguments of improbability is improbability stated in terms of violation of expectation, like the violation of the Law of Large Numbers.

See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law\_of\_large\_numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)

&amp;#x200B;

A favorite example of a violation of the law of large numbers is coming across a table where 500 fair coins are 100% in the heads configuration. We would not expect randomly flipped coins to do this! That is NOT an after-the-fact probability argument but rather a violation of expectation. A lot of science is built on the notion of expectation values, just ask Quantum physicists!

An evolutionary biologist who was involved in the infamous Kitzmller vs. Dover ID trial of the century made his whole schtick saying ID probability arguments were after-the-fact arguments. I eventually caused him to fold when I confronted him with the law of large numbers. 

See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelligentDesign/comments/agbm0r/design\_can\_sometimes\_be\_detected\_as\_a\_violation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelligentDesign/comments/agbm0r/design_can_sometimes_be_detected_as_a_violation/)

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, Judge Jones bought junk from that evolutionary biologist and the ACLU lawyers hook line and sinker, not to mention the Judge probably was prejudiced and it didn't help the Dover School board lied....but I digress.

The following system in the photo is obviously designed on two levels.

[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/G0MXA4/house-of-cards-made-of-playing-cards-G0MXA4.jpg](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/G0MXA4/house-of-cards-made-of-playing-cards-G0MXA4.jpg)

First it is designed for the simple fact that playing cards are designed.

Second the way the cards are arranged is designed because it is in the form of a house of cards which is a violation of ordinary expectation of random positions and orientations of cards. This may not be a trivial task to demonstrate rigorously in physics, but if we take random orientations of cards along each card's axis (as in yaw, pitch, roll) and then the x,y,z position in the a 3 dimensional Cartesian plane, we can say that the structure is a violation of equilibrium expectation from an initial configuration of x,y,z, yaw, pitch, roll coordinates for each card plus velocities of x-dot, y-dot, z-dot, yaw-dot, pitch-dot, roll-dot. \[GRRR, classical mechanics is such a mess.\]

Why can we say this? Randomly selected initial coordinates would result in the cards laying flat since if the equilibrium expectation is the cards would lay flat except for extreme cases where either the house of cards was built up slowly or the pieces put simultaneously in place by some set of tools or whatever. The first requirement is that when the x,y,z,yaw,pitch, roll coordinates are such that the cards are in the right place, the velocity coordinates (x-dot, y-dot, z-dot, yaw-dot, pitch-dot, roll-dot) are minimized toward zero.

One can see at least in principle, we can construct systems by selecting materials that will, when constructed, communicate to intelligent observers that the system is in a state that violates equilibrium expectation of randomly selected positions and orientations. It would suggest to intelligent observers that the structure (like a house of cards) is intelligently designed. This is easy for man-made designs to accept this, but God-made designs is another story, but the statistics at least are comparable in as much as instead of cards in the issue of building houses of cards, we are dealing with atoms in the issue of building life. To argue life is improbable is not an after-the-fact probability argument, it is an argument that chemical expectation is violated from random chemical states.

The real problem of abiogenesis is that the molecular structures are very much not like equilibrium expectation of random chemicals in random positions and in random quantum states and in random bonds, etc. Making the argument rigorous is a problem of tractability, but in principle, the idea in favor of intelligent design of life is that life is a strong violation of equilibrium expectation of randomly assembled components it is made of and that the chemical expectation is that a system of dead chemicals will remain dead, not spontaneously react to become a 3D-dimensional copying machines that life is.

Though a tractable formalization is probably beyond the reach of mere mortals for the origin of life, reasonable estimates say life is far from equilibrium expectation and is improbable in a way that is NOT an after-the-fact probability argument.

The goal of abiogenesis researchers apparently has been to demonstrate that life can be started without such narrow initial conditions, that it will emerge from a large number of highly probable (aka RANDOM) initial conditions. Well to me that is like expecting a tornado passing through a junkyard and making a functioning 747!",56,1549692880,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aopqi2/not_all_id_probability_arguments_are_afterthefact/

Left: Communists, socialists, progressives, liberal democrats.

Right: Fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, Tea Party conservatives, modern alt-right.

If you don't feel any of these groups represent you, feel free to make your own bin.

Predictions:

* Zero from the left.

* Mostly social conservatives, a few people who don't remember what the Tea Party was, and a handful of alt-right leaners.

As for myself: fiscally, I'm a freemarket socialist, as there are certain things that just don't work well under government control, in the same sense that there are some things that don't do well under the free market. I tend to go a bit further left on certain issues, mostly where it comes to corporate crime and responsibility.

The theory of evolution embraces and claims to be able to explain all of the following scenarios.

Stasis, on the scale of 3 billion years or so in the case of bacteria.

Change, when it happens, on a scale that answers to the more than 5 billion species that have ever lived on earth.

Change, when it happens, at variable and unpredictable rates.

Change, when it happens, in variable and unpredictable degrees.

Change, when it happens, in variable and unpredictable ways.

Hypothetically, if the evolutionary narrative of history is true, is it possible that human beings will, by a series of transitions and convergences, evolve into a life form that is, morphologically and functionally, similar to the primitive bacteria that were our proposed primordial ancestors?

Do you think this scenario more or less likely than any other?

Please justify your answer.

If you look at [the responses,](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/aibz2l/a_thought_experiment/) you will find that the overwhelming consensus is that transitioning from human to something resembling bacteria is so improbable as to be absurd.  The implication from many was that only someone completely ignorant of science could believe something so ridiculous.

I quite agree.  The essential arguments against such a transition were those any reasonable person would bring up.  You may look for yourself to see specifics, but essentially it boils down to this:  The number of factors that would have to line up and fall in place to produce that effect are prohibitive.  One person, for instance, very rightly pointed to the insurmountable transition from sexual to asexual reproduction. 
    
However, I still see no reason to believe that that transition is less likely (if the evolutionary history on earth is true) than any other transition of equal degree, like, for instance, the supposed transition from something like bacteria to human.  

In other words, I think the one transition is as absurdly unlikely as the other for all the same essential reasons.  See again, for instance, [Barrow and Tipler's calculation]9https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c) at around 1:20.


The usefulness of the *argumentum ad absurdum* is in its ability to help us see the full implications of some of our beliefs.

Creation,ag33pe,Godisandalliswell,,t2_g5ako,self.Creation,,The metaphysic of evolution,"Late 19th-century philosopher Borden Parker Bowne (1847-1910) offered a few criticisms of evolution from the standpoint of metaphysics in his 1880 book, [*Studies in Theism*](https://books.google.com/books?id=mMZZAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false). Despite advances in biology, the criticisms still hold true today. Bowne noted, e.g., that, ""Creation and evolution are not properly opposed. The opposite of creation is eternal existence."" This raises the question, what evolves? Created things or eternal things? 

Bowne divides being into two types: the ontological and the phenomenal. The ontological or ""real"" is essentially a simple, uncompounded causal agent. The soul or mind or thinking self is such an agent. Meanwhile, the phenomenal exists only for the perceiving mind. Such are all compound entities or aggregates. They have only a phenomenal or conceptual unity and identity. To explain this point (in a separate work), Bowne used the illustration of a crowd. The crowd has only a conceptual or phenomenal identity and unity; the ""realities"" in the crowd are the individual members, and it is only the individual members who do whatever is done. 

Applying Bowne's metaphysics to a body or a strand of DNA, we see that these are compound entities and so have only phenomenal existence. The realities in them--if these are not phenomenal also--would be the subatomic particles that make up the atoms that make up DNA, the cells, and the body. Apparently, it is not the atoms that are thought to evolve. The atoms simply shift about, indifferent to the outcome. But if DNA or genes are the subjects of evolution, then evolution is not ""real"" but only a transformation of one phenomenon into another. 

If the mind is real, however, then we cannot say that the individual mind is that which evolves in evolution. The mind or soul is created immediately. Each mind is a new factor in the universe. But if, on the contrary, the mind is only a phenomenal, or worse, an epiphenomenal, part of the evolutionary process, then the mind itself is not real. It is only a (epi)phenomenon with no real unity or identity. It is only something old made over into something new that will later pass into some other form. No wonder that atheistic materialists today have begun to call the self an illusion.

I'll stop here. I wanted to keep this post brief and just mention the largely unexplored field of metaphysics as it pertains to evolution. I think creationists are uniquely poised to have fun with it.",59,1547516075,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/ag33pe/the_metaphysic_of_evolution/
Creation,ag1pw0,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,Natural selection as God...,"When I first learned about the monstrous improbability of evolution (for example, [Barrow and Tippler’s calculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c) – at around 1:20) I wondered how a rational person could face such odds.  Yet I knew many people did. 
 
So I asked.

One type of response was to assure me that, since every outcome was monstrously improbable after the fact, I should not be surprised at any outcome.  Their analogy was winning the lottery.  “The odds of winning are monstrous but someone will win,” they pointed out.  Of course, this same line of thinking should also dismiss the probabilistic arguments which cite ERVs and broken genes as evidence of common descent, but that connection is rarely made.  

But by far the most common response cited natural selection.  “You’re forgetting about selection,” they would say.  

What I want to dwell on for a moment is how similar this is to saying, “You’re forgetting about God.”     

Now while I will allow that both God and Natural Selection are unquantifiable mechanisms of change, it must be admitted that God, conceptually, is omnipotent.  Natural Selection is not.  So at least God is capable of answering any improbability. 
 
Natural Selection is not.
 
Why then is it treated as if it were?  
 
I suppose the answer to that is a matter for psychology, but the fact that it is treated this way is undeniable.  The retort, “You’re forgetting about selection,” is given reflexively and unflinchingly in response to *literally any improbability.*  

Of course, it could be a reasonable response to *some degree* of improbability if only natural selection were quantifiable, but even then it would have limits to what it could do. 
 
And I don’t believe selection is quantifiable.   If it were, one could say, “Natural selection makes evolution in direction A this much [fill in a number] more likely than in direction B.  Therefore, we should not be surprised to find that evolution has occurred in direction A.”  

But evolution does not work this way, as I have been frequently informed by evolutionists themselves.

As I mentioned earlier, when evolutionists cite ERVs and broken genes as evidence of common descent, they are making arguments from probability.   One satisfactory way to respond to such arguments is to show how the dice are loaded.  If, for instance, there are hot spots for ERV insertion which are “used up to 280 times more frequently than predicted mathematically” then the dice are loaded, and the probability argument weakens.  After all, the chances that a die will roll a six are not one in six if it is loaded to roll sixes.  

   
Before I finish, I should mention one popular attempt to use numbers to answer the challenge of improbability.  This is Richard Dawkin’s infamous Methinks It Is Like a Weasel analogy.  I have already given [my thoughts on this topic]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7nfwif/new_years_cage_match_sanford_vs_dawkins/) if anyone is interested.  Suffice it to say that I do not think this demonstration rises even to the level of a good analogy, let alone a serious mathematical answer to the improbability of evolution.

If selection disqualifies itself as a properly quantifiable answer to the *majestic* improbability of evolution, what should the rational person’s response be?

Creation,aejnic,MRH2,"M.Sc. physics, Mensa",t2_8y18w,self.Creation,,Roche limit calculations for age of moon,"/u/Dzugavili spurred me on to look into this from his comment here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreationEvolution/comments/adj75j/invitation_to_dialogue_cybertruth5/ednofgh/

Here's what I've found

* The earth moon distance is 384,400 km. 
* The Roche limit is 18,470 km.  (Some sites say that it's 9496 km, but they are the exception).
* Thus the distance from the present position of the moon to the roche limit is A-B = 365,930 km.
* The moon is receding at 3.82 cm/year. Some sites claim 4.4cm/year.

Using v = d/t we get t = 365,930,000 m / 0.0382m/year = 9.5 billion years.

This means that the moon cannot be more than 9.5 billion years old (and the solar system is supposed to be 4.5 billion years old). So this doesn't pose any sort of problem for an evolutionary model.

If we use the faster recession rate, we get 8.3 billion years as the max age of the moon. Still no problem.

##However

**However, this assumes that the recession rate is constant.**

I'm trying to find out more about this and am not having much success. Some sites say that the recession rate would have been less in the past, others say that it would have been greater - as the moon moves away the tidal bulge angle decreases so there is less effect. This latter view makes sense to me.

Other findings:

* [Answers in Genesis](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/moon/lunar-recession/) calculates the recession rate of the moon as k/r^6  I don't know where this comes from.  (also [here](https://creation.com/the-moons-recession-and-age) ). This gives a maximum age of about 1.5 billion years.
* The current recession rate is high enough to cause some consternation. The solution is to claim that it is at present, anomalously high. https://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=85hqgo8bi2c4k21f159eo7mer6&amp;topic=71221.msg521091#msg521091
* This [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16307518) agrees with the AIG calculations and comes up with another way to show that the recession rate was much lower in the past.   ---&gt;

&gt;Dissipation of tidal energy causes the Moon to recede from the Earth. The currently measured rate of recession implies that the age of the Lunar orbit is 1500 My old, but the Moon is known to be 4500 My old. Consequently, it has been proposed that tidal energy dissipation was weaker in the Earth's past, but explicit numerical calculations are missing for such long time intervals. 

So ... I don't really know if the 1.5 Ga number is correct because I can't figure out the k/r^6 formula.  ",11,1547130837,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aejnic/roche_limit_calculations_for_age_of_moon/
Creation,adv9k1,cl1ft,YEC/RestorationMovementDisciple,t2_ngjao,self.Creation,,Creation/Evolution debate: A priori vs. a posteriori knowledge,"I've practically quit my internet debates.  Firstly I've seen little to no good come from them.  Usually people are using the easy, boundless connection of the internet to communication to strengthen their own position.  Secondly most discussions are fundamentally flawed from the beginning and rarely are discussions/arguments framed in a way that true progress is achievable.  


Even the term the ""creation/evolution debate"" is flawed, because many YECs such as myself will accept tenants of ""evolution"" (or possibly Darwinism that falls under that umbrella) such as natural selection or speciation.  We can't ever seem to get past this because we refuse to go beyond the broken debate format. (perhaps that is intentional?).

&amp;#x200B;

The major problem I have with the debates is that we inevitably reach the root of our gripe with either position.... that gripe is a human condition of lack or trust or lack of faith.  This is a ground that a materialist can't enter because they don't have the tools to investigate ontological positions which faith and trust are a large part of.  A large part of being a creationist is a deep trust in God.  Many creationists come to this faith via the word of God, the Bible.  

As humans we all process information basically the same way, yet I've talked to countless atheists who proclaim they have a superior processing method than faith-based Christians.  They say that their beliefs are based on evidence, many claim ""empirical"".  To me this is an arrogant position and one that isn't based on fact, because most all of the atheist internet warriors aren't basing their beliefs on purely a priori knowledge.  (mathematical or pure reason).  Of course math is used in some of the research that they have read about in forums, papers and journals (though I'd wager they rarely get it from the peer reviewed papers), but that math and raw data (some of which could be considered a priori, but certainly not all of it) is heavily filtered through assumptions, bias and margins of error.  


Their knowledge is not gathered a posteriori because rarely is experience a factor in formation of their beliefs.

Thus they arrive at their beliefs basically the same way a creationist does... through trust which began with faith.  This is the major reason I can't debate much anymore because very few (none in my experience) have been willing to say in humility that its faith and trust that guides them instead of a their pseudo-superior evidence gathering and belief-formation mechanism.

I started trying to find all of the uses of ATP in the cell:

* Sodium-Potassium pump
* Calvin (dark) cycle of photosynthesis
* Ca 2+ pump
* kinase (DNA check/repair)
* cell mitosis check points: G1 cyclin (G1 checkpoint), kinases (G2 checkpoint)
* loading amino acids onto tRNA (ATP -&gt; AMP)
* transport polypeptides into mitochondria
* ubiquitin mediated protein degradation by proteasomes
* dyenin and kinesin walking
* actin (muscle contraction)

and GTP (which is quite similar to ATP):
* import / export cycle in nuclear membrane
* ribosome construction (two subunits + MET tRNA)
* translocation of RNA in ribosome
* binding of each tRNA to mRNA in ribosome
* release of polypeptide chaing when ribosome encounters stop codon

1. Why is GTP primarily associated with providing energy to ribosomes and translation (codons to amino acids)? Why not ATP - would it some how mess things up?
2. How hard is it to design a molecule (ie enzyme) that uses ATP to do something? Has anyone ever done this? e.g. I want an enzyme to replace an H with an OH on some specific organic molecule. Can someone design this? I guess the first step is to figure out the required shape of the enzyme. Are we able to do this, or can we just look at what's already there in the cell and decipher it (because this is way too far advanced for us)? The second step is impossible I think: take the desired shape of the enzyme and then figure out the polypeptide chain that would make it. (If this is so very hard for us with our brains and technology, how does this sort of stuff arise in the first place - assuming no intelligent design?)

I think one will be blessed to do this if one is serious about these issues but doesn't have the time to squeeze in a traditional University level chemistry foundation in biochemistry.

Most evolutionary biologists I know have forgotten most of the important parts of biochem, especially the important parts that are in conflict with evolutionary biology!  There are also parts of biochem that are skipped over or not emphasized enough that would be of interest to IDists and Creationists.  

So here is week #1 in a short lesson. Be informed, and be blessed:

Creation,ac5rjw,Kanbei85,YEC,t2_w9cj2,self.Creation,,More on Historical vs Operational Science,"In a recent post at r/DebateEvolution, the guys there are predictably trashing the idea that there is a valid distinction to be made between historical and operational science. They will of course accept no reasonable explanation, but for those of you here that would like to have some good evidence that this is a 'real thing' and that people outside the niche of biblical creationism do use this distinction, the following quotes are helpful:  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“For example, Darwin introduced historicity into science. Evolutionary biology, in contrast with physics and chemistry, is a historical science—the evolutionist attempts to explain events and processes that have already taken place. Laws and experiments are inappropriate techniques for the explication of such events and processes. Instead one constructs a historical narrative, consisting of a tentative reconstruction of the particular scenario that led to the events one is trying to explain.”

—**Mayr, Ernst** (1904–2005), *Darwin’s Influence on Modern Thought*, based on a lecture that Mayr delivered in Stockholm on receiving the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, 23 September 1999; published on *ScientificAmerican.com*, 24 November 2009.

  
It has been claimed this is a quotemine because later on Mayr says:

&gt;  
The testing of historical narratives implies that the wide gap between science and the humanities that so troubled physicist C. P. Snow is actually nonexistent—by virtue of its methodology and its acceptance of the time factor that makes change possible, evolutionary biology serves as a bridge. 

  
Obviously this is a wrong statement that I would not agree with. We don't 'test' historical narratives like we do lab tests on empirical questions. We take evidence and we make an argument for what we believe occurred. Earlier on in the quoted portion it would seem Mayr understood this, so the above statement seems out of place and misleading, to say the least. But to seize upon this is to miss the point, since the issue is not particularly whether we can 'test' historical science, but simply whether this is a valid distinction that is used outside the creation community. The Mayr quote is sufficient to show that it is, and it is not a quotemine.  


Evolutionist E. O. Wilson also said:  


&gt;“If a moving automobile were an organism, functional biology would explain how it is constructed and operates, while evolutionary biology would reconstruct its origin and history—how it came to be made and its journey thus far.”

—**Wilson, E.O.** (1929– ), *From so Simple a Beginning*, p. 12, Norton, 2006.  


This is also a clear indication, though without the specific use of the terms, that a distinction is made by scientists in general between operational and historical science. What Wilson calls 'functional biology' is what we would call 'operational science', and what he calls 'evolutionary biology' is what we would call 'historical science'.  


This distinction is also found even in science textbooks:  


&gt;Geology is divided into two broad areas—physical \[i.e. operational\] geology and historical geology. Physical geology includes the examination of the materials that make up Earth and the possible explanations for the many processes that shape our planet. Processes below the surface create earthquakes, build mountains, and produce volcanoes. In contrast to physical geology, the aim of historical geology is to understand Earth’s long history.  
&gt;  
&gt;Historical geology tries to establish a timeline of the vast number of physical and biological changes that have occurred in the past …We study physical geology before historical geology because we must first understand how Earth works before we try to unravel its past.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/submit#_ftn1)

Creation,abb0wo,crystalized17,,t2_wjkep,self.Creation,,How did the ecosystem work before sin?,"I’m a young-earth-but-old-universe creationist (seventh day Adventist and vegan specifically.)

This is just theoretical musing.

I think it makes sense that all animals were vegan before the Fall and some species just adapted to eating meat after the Fall, probably due to certain types of plants going extinct, food scarcity, etc. It’s very easy to imagine this kind of adaption since technically “obligate” carnivores like cats could survive on plants if enough taurine was in them. Instead, we use technology to pull small amounts of taurine from plants until we have enough to create vegan cat food. Dogs thrive just fine on plants since they’re really omnivores and not obligate carnivores like cats. Cats do well on the taurine artificially pulled from plants, so all they would need is a plant that carried enough of it naturally. Tons of plants have gone extinct, as evidenced by the fossil record. Who knows what nutrients those plants were carrying.


But I wonder about the “deathless-ness and zero suffering” state before sin. How would that have scientifically worked out in the ecosystem? After sin, we have all kinds of cleaners and scavenger animals for dead, decaying matter (plant or animal matter).
I do think Adam/Eve were “raw fruitarians” in the garden of eden. AKA everything they ate (fruit, eggplant, tomatoes, squash, nuts, seeds, grains) would have been picked from the plant without destroying it. AKA there wouldn’t be much dead plant matter, if any. Although I’m not sure if the animals were also this way or not since the Bible speaks that humans would eat the “herb of the field” like the animals after the Fall of Man. I’ve always understood the “herb of the field” to be “vegetables” aka the leaf, stem, or root of a plant. AKA dead plant matter becomes common because we are now destroying the plants when we rip them out by the roots to eat them. But this may not be a problem for the animals since I know cows and horses graze, but they don’t pull the plant out by the roots. So as long as there isn’t overgrazing, the plant survives. So really only “root” vegetables like carrots and potatoes die when they are harvested.

As for plants, while nothing proves that they “feel pain”, they absolutely do respond to stimuli and at least some of that definitely must have happened after the Fall. AKA some plants growing thorns, becoming poisonous, even carnivorous plants eating insects, in order to defend and adapt themselves to a world full of sin. Genesis 3:17 states that quite clearly.

Here’s my long list of Bible quotes about diet if you want to walk thru how human diet changed before and after sin: https://hclfvegan.neocities.org/eden_diet.html


I think humans and animals had to sleep and poop and eat before sin. Such things don’t hurt the ecosystem and beneficial bacteria or animals can readily clean that kind of stuff up without “death” being involved. There may have been plenty of decaying plant matter too, since plants don’t feel pain or suffer like animals, but I still lean toward the idea of humans and animals being able to eat the “fruit” or “leaf” of the plant without utterly destroying it. AKA plant remains unharmed and it’s fruits help spread its seeds.

But I still have lots of musings about a “deathless” world:

1. How do humans and animals avoid stepping on bugs and accidentally killing them? 

2. How do the plants populate? If nothing ever dies and they keep spreading seeds, seems like they’d quickly run out of room to grow.

3. Same thing with animals and humans. If nothing ever dies, how in the world will there be enough room? Is some kind of “equilibrium” achieved and maintained? AKA like how overcrowded civilizations tend to have less children because of scarcity of resources? But that doesn’t seem very in line with God’s command to “go forth and multiple”. 

I could understand if he creates the Garden of Eden and leaves the rest of the planet relativity bare so that there’s “growing room”, but eventually you will hit “max planetary capacity”. Maybe humans get to go to the next planet after that. But what about plants and animals? Do they achieve some kind of “equilibrium” on their own once they’ve reached max planetary capacity?

Once again, this is just stuff I like to ponder out of curiosity.

P.S. can we not get into a debate over Bible interpretation if you don’t take Genesis literally like I show in my link above? I just want to discuss how scientifically a ecosystem like this might work or what God had planned for population control in a sinless, deathless world. It’s just pure speculation based on what little we do know about science and God’s nature.",86,1546288843,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/abb0wo/how_did_the_ecosystem_work_before_sin/

There is a degree of allowance where a species can adapt (claimed to be micro-evolution), but beyond a certain biological or ontological boundary, cannot evolve to form a new species, as evolution claims.

It is this boundary that I find problematic. It is never fleshed out precisely what demarcates between micro and macro evolution. Creationists,  as far as I am aware, always make this distinction, but never show the boundary that distinguishes a case of micro or macro evolution.

This is problematic because Creationists can simply shift goalposts whenever blurry cases appear. 

 Take for example this instance of a hybrid species of flower capable of breeding with other hybrids, but cannot breed with both parent species. Won't this be an example of speciation, and thus undermining this core creationist claim?

Creationists have two options to save their faith in 'fixed kinds'. One: claim that speciation has not occured, and have to explain why. I have never heard a good explanation so far. Two, claim that speciation has occured, and has to admit that this core doctrine of fixed kinds has to be revised, which is clearly an untenable one since it is almost a dogmatic principle of Creationism not to accept evolution.

My point is this: the distinction between micro and macro evolution, is nothing more than an artificial distinction. Since no definition of what constitutes a species, no definition of the ""boundaries"" have been provided, I am forced to conclude the illusory nature of such a distinction.

However, as a principle of charity, I hope to hear what a Creationist sub has to say about this issue. And I am willing to change my mind.",28,1546030142,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aae6tp/what_exactly_is_the_ontological_boundary_that/

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.\[4\]

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

[x-posted and adapted from r/CreationEvolution and r/IntelligentDesign]

Supposedly we evolved from a fish, some sort of Sarcopterygiian (like lungfish or coelacanth).

When I saw a what is known as a LASTZ comparison between a coelacanth vs. humans, and a coelecan vs. other fish (like a shark), humans and coelecanths were the closest. But if you look at them morphologically, a coelacanth look more like other fish, not a human! Not to mention, at the individual gene level rather than the whole genome level, the comparisons are not so definitive!

Look at this Neighbor Joining tree I built with the COX1 gene, notice humans do NOT look like they descended from fish:

http://www.creationevolutionuniversity.com/science/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nj_differnces_circled2-111-1.png

It looks like humans are a sister group of fish, not a descendant of them. Of course, Joe Felsenstein protested and said Sharks should be the outgroup, not ciona.

Fair enough, but the point I was making is you can ROOT the phylogenetic tree any dang way you want to get any almost dang result you want. NONSENSE!

The way I rooted it caused humans to be a sister group of fish not a descendant!  You'll get a similar result if you UN-root the tree.  You'll get different trees using UPGMA, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, whatever.  That in and of itself is not very re-assuring.

OddJackDaw said I quotemined Evolutionary biologist Matzke:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a79y4g/some_of_the_most_flagrant_quote_mining_ive_ever/

I did not. I was pointing out Matzke's argument by assertion and non-sequitur. It does not follow that if we are able to group things together as sister groups based on characters that they are necessarily PHYSICAL as opposed to CONCEPTUAL sister groups.

In fact, CONCEPTUAL sister groups preclude macro evolution because you'd expect mammals to give rise to mammals, fish to fish, birds to birds.

You wouldn't expect fish to give rise to giraffes, fish to give rise to Kangaroos, fish to give rise to Parrots. That's something Matzke can't seem to grasp.

One way to get around this problem is to ""ROOT"" the phylogenetic trees in such a way that you assume what you're trying to prove. Circular reasoning.

When one UNroots the tree on individual genes, one gets trees where humans are not descended from fish on some genes and then trees that aren't so clear on other genes. In fact some genes would be totally uninformative of a tree for most animals, like Histone 3!

That's true. The converse is also true: there are things we can look for that would invalidate evolution. It just so happens that we do find things that invalidate evolution all over the place. There are many examples of this, but my personal favorite is [Genetic Entropy](http://www.geneticentropy.org/).

&gt;Evolution is a science because all of the tests that have been performed that could disprove it have come up negative. Some of those tests are also compatible with creationism. No matter whether evolution is inevitably correct, it is undeniably falsifiable and therefore scientific, whereas creationism is unfalsfiable and therefore there is no reason to believe it is true other than arbitrary preference.

Actually, neither creation nor evolution are [operational science](https://creation.com/its-not-science). Your statement that evolution has not been falsified is simply incorrect.

&gt;You said ""why do people believe humans magically came from non-living matter"". That's not close to what scientists believe. They believe the laws of physics made it so some structures are more stable than others. Some of those structures combine and happen to be more stable. Over time the stable structures should last while the unstable ones are only temporary.

Thats the opposite of reality. Organic structures are highly unstable and they decay away very quickly. The laws of chemistry work **against** organic life, not for it. That is why it took an incredible amount of engineering to create life. It's exactly the same way that the laws of physics work against our automobiles, causing them to decay and rust and break over time. Life is no different. It takes engineering and maintenance to keep life going, and to get it started. Life only comes from life- that is the scientific law of Biogenesis. What you are suggesting would be a violation of known scientific law, which means it is a miracle. But your miracle has no god to perform it.

&gt;If you believe that God, a stable structure, created humans in his image then you believe we are stable self promoting strutures that came from a stable self promoting structure. Therefore you believe in a kind of ""evolution"", just not the kind with a simple/rational/physical/logically supported/empirically supported explanation for why the original stable self promoting structure was there.

This is a strawman. God is not a 'structure'. God is a Spirit. Humans are not 'stable structures', either. Our bodies are highly complicated and break easily. Each generation we are slightly more mutated and degenerated due to genetic entropy.

&gt;Now for my less speculative interpretations to join evolutionary theory and God, assuming that there is a God. If God created the universe it seems like he would be intelligent enough to use the naturally occurring form of evolution in the system he created to guide humans into existence.

Of course, God is smart enough to do that, but why would he? And did he? To know the answer to this, we must consult the word of God, the Bible. There is no other way to know for sure what God did. As it turns out, the Bible makes no mention that God used an evolutionary process of any kind to create--indeed, it contradicts the idea severely. God created a world that was originally perfect and without death, disease or suffering. Those things only came into the picture as a result of the sin of mankind in listening to the serpent, Satan, and rebelling against God.",22,1544831914,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a6abr4/a_continuing_discussion_with_another_redditor/

1) Contrary to what you may have heard, labs *are* capable of returning an age of ""0"" for potassium-argon dating tests.  Therefore, when rocks that are only a few years old are tested, and the tests say the rocks are millions of years old, the problem is excess argon trapped in the sample (which gives an exaggerated age) not that the test itself is incapable of detecting young ages.  This happens routinely.

2) Contrary to what you may have heard, using this method of dating on rocks whose ages *we know by observation* (as historical events) is *not* dishonest but rather the only way of securing a standard for judging the accuracy of radiometric dating methods.  There is an abundance of non-creationist, peer-reviewed literature reporting the results of such tests.  At around 32:30 you will see a chart listing some of these results.

“For example, Darwin introduced historicity into science. Evolutionary biology, in contrast with physics and chemistry, is a historical science—the evolutionist attempts to explain events and processes that have already taken place. Laws and experiments are inappropriate techniques for the explication of such events and processes. Instead one constructs a historical narrative, consisting of a tentative reconstruction of the particular scenario that led to the events one is trying to explain.”",62,1544725889,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a5w6m7/observational_vs_historical_science/

Not sure if this is accurate or not but I do know  that human embryonic cells have been implanted into pigs and advances  are being made in that area of science.

I'm curious what creationists, atheists, darwinists, etc. think about this.

My  own perspective is that God created the universe, we have a purpose and  if he created it, even though it is corrupted, mutated and declining  the original purpose and design was ""good"".  I feel with our limited  perspective that we simply cannot understand the repercussions of the  ways we mess with that design and ill effects are impossible to not  experience.  I realize this mentality can be taken too far.  I realize  that many advances in medical realms and scientific advances are good  and don't go against that design, but if we get in too deep into genetic  manipulation where we are creating I think very bad things could  happen.  Putting a human/pig chimeric heart into a human might seem good  in some circles but considering there are so many things we don't  understand about the human heart, the heart-brain relationship, the  neurons in the human heart... etc. it seems premature to try and build a  better heart to put in us.

I understand  that some worldviews have none of those qualms.  Some believe we are  totally in charge of reality, there is no original design and our future  is simply what we make it.  However I believe if some worldviews are  true to their philosophy would have issues with this science as well.  A  Darwinist would surely take issue with mankind messing with the genome.   Genetic mutation and natural selection are a process that have  proceeded for millenia in their belief and it would seem this is somehow  cheating that system with a limited understanding... you would think  that could spell disaster for the human race, correct?

Just  curious to hear other positions on this.  I try to not worry about  much, but I feel this issue is becoming close to being real in the next  several years and the moral, ethical and other implications for society  and humanity can't be scoffed at or dismissed easily solely in the name  of ""progress"".",14,1544113786,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a3phhq/chimeras_creationistevolutionist_stance/

\&gt;The study has been **misunderstood** by some religious parties who thought it meant that we all came into being in some seminal Big Bang-typed event 100,000 ago, but this isn't what the findings actually suggest.  **What Stoeckle and Thaler's findings point to is that our species has to revamp far more often than we thought, and we do so in unison with all animals**.

1. To explain a bit, this is *not* the case of Adam and Eve being created. Rather, this is a case of a **genetic bottleneck**, where there was an environmental catastrophe. In fact, this excerpt also stated that this has happened **quite a few times** in human pre-history.
2. The idea of a genetic bottleneck is not new. In fact, in my high school biology class, we already learnt of a mitochondrial Eve. This is NOT Eve. It is simply the matrilineal DNA that traces back to a single woman. Here is the wikipedia explanation:

The name ""Mitochondrial Eve"" alludes to biblical [Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve). This led to repeated misrepresentations or misconceptions in journalistic accounts on the topic. [Popular science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science) presentations of the topic usually point out such possible misconceptions by emphasizing the fact that the position of mt-MRCA is neither fixed in time (as the position of mt-MRCA moves forward in time as [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) (mtDNA) lineages become extinct), **nor does it refer to a ""first woman"", nor the only living female of her time, nor the first member of a ""new species""**.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve#cite_note-9)

I wanted to share my refutation of the first part of the evidence on the page, ""Evidence from comparative physiology and biochemistry"". Criticism is welcome.




&gt;Genetics
&gt;One of the strongest evidences for common descent comes from gene sequences. Comparative sequence analysis examines the relationship between the DNA sequences of different species,[1] producing several lines of evidence that confirm Darwin's original hypothesis of common descent. If the hypothesis of common descent is true, then species that share a common ancestor inherited that ancestor's DNA sequence, as well as mutations unique to that ancestor. More closely related species have a greater fraction of identical sequence and shared substitutions compared to more distantly related species.

This is fallacious because it assumes that shared DNA sequences mean that the species descended from a common ancestor.

&gt;Universal biochemical organisation and molecular variance patterns
&gt;A deeper understanding of developmental biology shows that common morphology is, in fact, the product of shared genetic elements.[5] For example, although camera-like eyes are believed to have evolved independently on many separate occasions,[6] they share a common set of light-sensing proteins (opsins), suggesting a common point of origin for all sighted creatures.


This is fallacious because shared features do not necessarily mean shared origin, therefore dismissed.


&gt;DNA sequencing
&gt; For example, neutral human DNA sequences are approximately 1.2% divergent (based on substitutions) from those of their nearest genetic relative, the chimpanzee, 1.6% from gorillas, and 6.6% from baboons.[9][10] Genetic sequence evidence thus allows inference and quantification of genetic relatedness between humans and other apes.


This is invalid because the DNA differences, which correlate to appearance, are more likely to have been created separately rather than meaning that the animals split off from a common ancestor. Yes, I can provide proof of this.

&gt;Proteins
&gt;Vital proteins, such as the ribosome, DNA polymerase, and RNA polymerase, are found in everything from the most primitive bacteria to the most complex mammals. The core part of the protein is conserved across all lineages of life, serving similar functions. Higher organisms have evolved additional protein subunits, largely affecting the regulation and protein-protein interaction of the core. Other overarching similarities between all lineages of extant organisms, such as DNA, RNA, amino acids, and the lipid bilayer, give support to the theory of common descent. Phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences from various organisms produce similar trees of relationship between all organisms.


This is invalid and one of the stupidest arguments. It's literally saying that because different organisms have proteins, they all must have come from the same source. It says the additional protein subunits evolved, but gives no evidence for this claim.  They claim that similarities between DNA and other molecules give support to common descent, without stating how this is the case.

&gt;Pseudogenes
&gt; Non-functional pseudogenes may be passed on to later species, thereby labeling the later species as descended from the earlier species.

This claim will need evidence in order to be considered. Of course, the article named ""Evidence of common descent"" doesn't actually provide evidence, just a vapid gish gallop.


&gt;Other mechanisms
&gt;A large body of molecular evidence supports a variety of mechanisms for large evolutionary changes, including: genome and gene duplication, which facilitates rapid evolution by providing substantial quantities of genetic material under weak or no selective constraints; horizontal gene transfer, the process of transferring genetic material to another cell that is not an organism's offspring, allowing for species to acquire beneficial genes from each other; and recombination, capable of reassorting large numbers of different alleles and of establishing reproductive isolation. The endosymbiotic theory explains the origin of mitochondria and plastids (including chloroplasts), which are organelles of eukaryotic cells, as the incorporation of an ancient prokaryotic cell into ancient eukaryotic cell.


They just disproved themselves, lol. The endosymbiotic theory is impossible, there is no mechanism by which it could have happened. I can provide proof of this as well.


&gt;Specific examples from comparative physiology and biochemistry


&gt;Chromosome 2 in humans

Nope. This has already been debunked. 

https://www.icr.org/article/new-research-debunks-human-chromosome/

&gt;Cytochrome c and b


&gt;For example, if the average time it takes for a base pair of the cytochrome c gene to mutate is N years, 

They did not explain how that time is measured, or if it even happens.

&gt;In addition, Cytochrome b is commonly used as a region of mitochondrial DNA to determine phylogenetic relationships between organisms due to its sequence variability. 

Invalid, because DNA sequences were more likely to have been designed and created.

&gt;The retroviruses (or virogenes) are always passed on to the next generation of that organism that received the infection. This leaves the virogene left in the genome. Because this event is rare and random, finding identical chromosomal positions of a virogene in two different species suggests common ancestry.

Invalid, because this event is not rare and random. ERVs could easily have infected multiple, different, organisms.

&gt;Recent African origin of modern humans

&gt;For example, the Out of Africa theory of human origins, which states that modern humans developed in Africa and a small sub-population migrated out (undergoing a population bottleneck), implies that modern populations should show the signatures of this migration pattern. Specifically, post-bottleneck populations (Europeans and Asians) should show lower overall genetic diversity and a more uniform distribution of allele frequencies compared to the African population. Both of these predictions are borne out by actual data from a number of studies.


Not evidence for evolution in any way.

So you are jus a fucking liar John Brea that I do not point out what evolutionists do wrong. And a fucking fascist who doesn't support freedom of opinion. This subreddit is taken over by evolutionist trolls. 

For all the millions of times atheists talk about facts, evidence, the scientific method, you are going to delete these very few instances where somebody talks about subjectivity. That is not balanced. 



To say someone is evil is to express a subjective opinion. 

I form the opinion by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, choosing the word ""evil"". I might have chosen the word ""nice"", that would be an equally logically valid opinion.

The evolution scientists have several courses of action available to them, and evil is what makes their choices turn out the way they do, instead of another way. 

The existence of evil is therefore a matter of chosen opinion, it is spiritual. I choose the opinion it exists. 

That's how subjectivity works, an opinion is formed with a choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice. 

I look at the choices evolution scientists make, look at the consequences of their choices, look at what other options they had, and then I make an opinion on what the agency of their choices was. 

It's because of evolution scientists that the human spirit is not commonly acknowledged anymore in society. People don't acknowledge each other's emotions anymore because they don't understand how subjectivity works anymore. 

First the evolution scientist describes the entire life of organisms using subjective words, like that an organisms likes to survive, that it has fear, joy and whatever. Then the evolution scientist asserts that this is all factual. The evolution scientists assert subjective words as fact. 

Second the evolution scientist asserts creationism is wrong, while subjective opinion, as explained, is a creationist concept. 

So 1 and 2, it is a doubleslam against subjectivity, which results in particularly higher educated people having no clue about how subjectivity works, and disregarding people's emotions. Almost 100 percent of scientists accept evolution, so it basically applies to all scientists, not just evolution scientists. 

If I post on the internet about the human spirit it is certain everybody there will require evidence for this spirit thing. Nobody has a clue anymore about how subjectivity works.

Creation,9zh3sf,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.Creation,,Evolution scientists are evil,"To say someone is evil is to express a subjective opinion. 

I form the opinion by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, choosing the word ""evil"". I might have chosen the word ""nice"", that would be an equally logically valid opinion.

The evolution scientists have several courses of action available to them, and evil is what makes their choices turn out the way they do, instead of another way. 

The existence of evil is therefore a matter of chosen opinion, it is spiritual. I choose the opinion it exists. 

That's how subjectivity works, an opinion is formed with a choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice. 

I look at the choices evolution scientists make, look at the consequences of their choices, look at what other options they had, and then I make an opinion on what the agency of their choices was. 

It's because of evolution scientists that the human spirit is not commonly acknowledged anymore in society. People don't acknowledge each other's emotions anymore because they don't understand how subjectivity works anymore. 

First the evolution scientist describes the entire life of organisms using subjective words, like that an organisms likes to survive, that it has fear, joy and whatever. Then the evolution scientist asserts that this is all factual. The evolution scientists assert subjective words as fact. 

Second the evolution scientist asserts creationism is wrong, while subjective opinion, as explained, is a creationist concept. 

So 1 and 2, it is a doubleslam against subjectivity, which results in particularly higher educated people having no clue about how subjectivity works, and disregarding people's emotions. Almost 100 percent of scientists accept evolution, so it basically applies to all scientists, not just evolution scientists. 

If I post on the internet about the human spirit it is certain everybody there will require evidence for this spirit thing. Nobody has a clue anymore about how subjectivity works. Certainly society has become a bad joke, where it is held to be virtue to systematically ignore people's emotions, because it is virtue to adhere to the scientific method in all cases.

The schoolbook for the Hitler Youth shows where teaching evolution science ends up. The book starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"", and then it proceeds to claim that the content of character of people is a factual issue of racial science.

So what I’m wondering is this. Imagine a possible universe in which the scientific consensus on evolution is true. *What do you expect to observe that we don’t observe*?

Obviously, it should be something that a reasonable person should expect to be able to observe, or replicate, over the course of the 150 years or so that we’ve working on evolution. So not, e.g. the evolution of a new limb.

Also, please be specific. When I ask this question IRL I sometimes get answers like “some complex new structure”, which is too vague, as it could be twisted to suit either the creationist or the evolutionist narrative.

It therefore stands to reason that organisms being complex functionally integrated objects, to speculate that organisms were intelligently designed.

This sort of reasoning is used all over the place, and many times ofcourse it works out, that a similar effect was indeed produced by a similar cause. It is the legitemate default speculation, because of the 100 percent certainty we have for the mechanism of intelligent design to be capable to produce functionally integrated complexity. Natural selection does not have such a similiar high level of proof that it can do the job. So that's why intelligent design theory has priority over natural selection as being the default speculation.

Human intelligent design functions by the human mind choosing how to put things together. The human mind is a sort of universe in it's own right. One can model things in it that exists in the universe proper, and one can imagine things in it that don't exist in the universe proper.

The basic human mind is formed by the DNA system. So now the question is, does the DNA system carry the information to form the basic human mind as some kind of recipe or blueprint, or does the DNA system itself function as a sort of mind, and is the human mind an extended version of the DNA system?

I figure the evidence points to the last, that the DNA system already has the basic function of mind.

- the DNA system guides development of the organism to adulthood , as like a watchmaker guides development of a watch.

- the DNA system can produce an ant and an elephant a wide variety of organisms, just as a mind is capable to think of a wide variety of things

- even single cell organisms exhibit properties of mind, an awareness of their environment, being responsive rather than reactive, processing information

- the DNA system is shown to consist of a few bases, rather than an infinity of different molecules for different organisms. This is in line with the bases being used for information processing, where if there were an infinity of different milecules this would not be efficient for information processing. 

- the evidence shows that the DNA system has the same fundamental mathematical ordering as the universe proper does, which is expected of a mind, it being like a universe in it's own right.

Therefore it may be that new organisms are formed in dreams of the DNA system, functioning as a sort of mind.

Although this is not a complete theory of intelligent design, because we would expect to see more extraterrestrial life if creation of organisms were just by the DNA mind. 

There is now no theory of development in biology, no theory of abiogenesis, there is only speculative theory on functionally integrated complexity by natural selection.  As shown intelligent design theory explains all of these. Intelligent design is really the theory that pulls all biology together, explaining it. Actually evolution theory has never explained anything. It has only served as an interpretative framework of perception, looking at things in terms of them being different, changing.

The history of nazi germany shows this. As you can read in the schoolbook for the Hitler Youth at archive dot org. The book starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"". It then proceeds to explain that the content of character of people, the spirit, is a matter of fact of racial science. Then later in the book it describes natural selection as designating worth of people, and natural selection is extended to socialist selection. That a country of millions can come under the influence of an ideology where worth is equated as fact proves that people in general have problems with distinguishing the proper domain of fact from the proper domain opinion.

2. Solely creationism validates both fact and opinion, separately, each in their own right.

Creator, chooses, spiritual, existence of which is a matter of chosen opinion

Creation, chosen, material, existence of which is a matter fact forced by evidence

3. It stands to reason / common sense, that people require understanding of subjectivity at an intellectual level, in order to be better at subjective pursuits. Eventhough generally everybody already has an inherent understanding of subjectivity on an instinctive level. 

1,2,3 therefore people generally should learn creationism, so that they do not fall to irrational ideology which reject  subjectivity, such as nazism, so that they can provide intellectual guidance for their subjective pursuits.

All the other issues in creationism vs evolution are insignificant hobby issues, compared to the consequences of this issue of the acceptance of the validity of subjectivity. ",103,1542325969,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9xgqaq/lets_try_again_subjectivity/

Creation,9wkxkp,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.Creation,,The mental disorder underlying socialism,"This is actually a serious post.

The mental disorder socialists have is that they fail to distinguish fact from opinion (like opinion on what is beautiful and good) . Generally they conceive of every issue as factual, including they assert what is good and beautiful as fact. 

This mental disorder is most clear in national socialism. You can look at the schoolbook for the Hitler Youth at the internet archive. It starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"". It then proceeds to explain how the content of character of people is a matter of scientific fact, just as well as what the human body is made out of is a matter of fact. It then later proceeds with explaining natural selection as designating worth, which is extended to socialist selection. 

Communism, also called scientific socialism, is based around dialectic materialism. Materialism solely validates fact, not opinion. The existence of a material thing is a fact.

The modernday social democrat does like to say they support subjectivity. But when you investigate more precisely it turns out they define subjectivity as meaning facts about brainstates. For example, to say a painting is beautiful, is explained as stating a fact of a love for the way the painting looks existing in the brain. 

On a level of instinct everybody understands and accepts the validity of subjectivity. Basically everybody is capable to use subjective words like ""beautiful"" correctly in common discourse. But on the intellectual level the acceptance of subjectivity is very minimal. 

To have an intellectual understanding of how subjectivity works, you need to accurately reflect the rules with which subjective words are used in common discourse. So not fantasize stuff yourself about how it works, as much as you like to think you are a genius, just only dumb and disciplined accurate reflection. 

And the rules are:
1. an opinion must be chosen
2. an opinion must express what it is that makes a choice 

For example the phrase ""I find this painting beautiful"". 

The opinion is formed by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, thus choosing the opinion. 

The opinion it is ugly could also have been chosen, and would have been equally valid. 

To be forced to say the painting is beautiful provides an error, an invalid opinion. 

The word ""beautiful"" expresses a love for the way the painting looks. 

Out of this love the word ""beautiful"" was chosen. 

Now you shouldn't confuse choosing the word beautiful, with choosing to love the way the painting looks. It is just a word that is chosen, the love is what is doing the choosing. 

What this means is that the existence of the love for the way the painting looks is just as well a matter of opinion. It is equally valid to choose the opinion this love does not exist, as to choose the opinion that it does exist. 

So that is how subjectivity works. Basically subjectivity is a creationist concept. That is because subjectivity works by choice, and choice is the mechanism of creation, how things originate. Creationism validates opinion in regards to a creator, and validates fact in regards to a creation. 

Creator, chooses, spiritual, existence of which is a matter of chosen opinion

Creation, chosen, material, existence of which is a matter fact forced by evidence

These rules is why creationists divide a human being into a soul and body. The soul does the choosing, it is spiritual, the existence of it is a matter of opinion, faith. The body is chosen, it is material, the existence of it is a matter of fact forced by evidence. 

Ofcourse creationism is the most ridiculed doctrine in academics today. Which is why academics in general is socialist, and why highly educated people generally suck at any subjective pursuit like family, friendship, religion, politics, culture. 

Think about what a lot of sense this explanation makes. Wouldn't it have massive, enormous, consequences if subjectivity in general is undermined?  The reason social justice warriors are so screechy is because they have a misplaced factual certitude they are right, instead of a limited confidence in their judgement. The reason a nazi is coldhearted and calculating is because they consider worth a factual issue of racial science. It makes sense.

What is a soul? More or less all emotions you have and have had in life.

What is emotion? Motivation of a choice, what makes a choice.

How is an emotion identified? By expression of emotion with free will, choosing an opinion on what the emotion is.

So basically what marriage is functionally, is that you make some decisions from this new union of souls, whereas before you just make decisions from your own soul. 

That people don't understand this is what makes marriages suck, and makes people choose a single life. Without creationist understanding of marriage, the marriage becomes a performance contract, like a job. And you get endless negotiations between spouses that each gets an equal share. Also, the love isn't cherished, because the spouses have no clue where the love is at, so it just dies. 

That's the result of evolution theory replacing creationism, stupidity about marriage. Evolution theory makes people lose emotional credibility in general. It is just not possible to have good emotional credibility when you have no sense of the spirit of the choices by which everything was created.

Creation,9t6eah,ekill13,,t2_15mdnt,self.Creation,,Let's be polite in our discussions.,"First, I want to say that I really appreciate this sub. I think most people on this sub are very knowledgeable and polite. I think that this sub is good about being able to keep discussions to the facts and evidence rather than to personal attacks. However, there have been times when I have seen all semblance of civility put aside. I have been called intellectually dishonest. I have been told that I put my dogma over scripture. I have been called a liar. All of this happened in one thread because I was trying to explain why I believe creation happened in 6 days. I was trying to be as polite as I possibly could. I did my best to stay on subject and not say anything about the other person or their intentions. I tried to be reasonable and open minded. I merely did not find the argument compelling, plus the poster repeatedly took my quotes out of context to make it seem like I agreed with them. When I called them on that, they said I was lying and they weren't doing that. 

Regardless, I'm not going to name names, but some people on this sub, although not a lot, need to be more willing to have a legitimate conversation with someone they disagree with. I'll admit I get a little dogmatic and defensive at times. I would guess we all do. I would just encourage anyone who reads this to give everyone else the benefit of the doubt, at least in regards to their heart and intentions, and keep personal attacks out of it. There is no reason to get mad. There is no reason to insult each other. Let's just all agree to disagree on certain things and move on. We can debate all we want, but let's do it politely and not make things personal.

Creation,9t35al,Mike_Enders,,t2_i9d8rdt,self.Creation,,The days of creation CANNOT be interpreted as ordinary 24 hour days,"a common argument of  YECs is that  we can determine the days of creation in genesis one by referencing what  a day presently is or other passages in the Bible  post creation state (even though often they do not state what is claimed either).   This logically cannot work and will NEVER logically work no matter how popular  it is in some groups.   


I've  taken a lot of attacks by relating my perfectly literal  reading of genesis one here in r/creation and its got to the point where at least one person has even created a thread just to talk about me (I am not going to reciprocate in calling out a name because I consider starting a thread about someone else  as  more than a bit sleazy without inviting them to discuss it beforehand. Scripture states as well if you have that  amount of issue with a believer you should take it to him personally not throw his.her name around )   


So  here  I am forced to  state my view separately rather than have other mischaracterize and lie about it  


I've been YEC for most of my life but  a few things always bothered me but I pushed them aside. Then A few years back I undertook to reread  genesis one with particular emphasis to mute  all the noise  of the controversy and read the text as if i was reading it for the first time.  I was deeply surprised by what i found.  in this post I will only get into what I found in regard to creation days .  I do need to make one stop before I get into it.  


The present  tactic and  practice whenever  one holds something not in line with some YEC organizations is to  make all kinds of claims regarding their salvation, their walk with God  and their compromising status in regard to modern science - all without knowing  anything about the person or as  in my case even the position itself.  


Thats classic dogma (and sickeningly pharisee like)  so let me cut if off at the knees for the YECs reading this who just reading the title are ready to launch that accusation.  I am ANTI - Darwin evolution (or whatever they are calling it today).   I see no way for  Humans  to have evolved from  apes or to have been on the  planet for millions of years biblically. I side with YEC's in regard to soft tissue preservation.   Adam to now probably 6-15,000 year maybe  as high as 50,000 but completely out of line with millions years. Universal Common descent - bogus.   Evolution by  random mutation, error and  natural selection - VACANT.  


IF I am compromising because of modern science i sure took an odd set of conclusions to draw so the claim is utterly false no matter how your dogma wants to bear that false accusation. it doesn't stick.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to keep  argumentation about the text to a minimum and just state things the passage states that people overlook  


1) Amazingly  Genesis one DEFINES what a day is.  You can argue with it you can fight it but it says  what a day is.  


Day is Light. the end  


&gt; "" And God called the light Day, ""  


Genesis  1:5     


 Plain and simple. SO we don't need to go further than the text.  the word day refers to Light.  LITERALLY  and IN  
 CONTEXT. There no need to run anywhere else. First rule of hermeneutics is the contextual meaning always comes first. So strictly speaking a day is LIGHT because thats what the text says - nothing else.  


2) The text  DEFINES what night is  


&gt; and the darkness he called Night   


darkness is not light and its not day. NO day includes darkness.  doesn't matter what our  conventions  of speech are today and what we call a day. In biblical times and in this verse  day ends and night comes with darkness. Including night hours as part of a day is OPPOSITE to what the passage states.    


Do we go by God's word  or our  positions?  


3) Every day is punctuated by  either periods beginning light or ending it NOT NIGHT HOURS  


&gt;"" And the evening and the morning were the first day. ""  


The word evening is NOT the word for night in Hebrew. They Are two separate words.  Evening in hebrew  refers to  just after sunset or what we  sometimes call dusk as the stars begin to ""come out"". Every act of God is punctuated  or begun with either reference to light  coming or light going NOT NIGHT  


It would have been so easy for God to have stated  - and the night and the morning was the fist day.  He  deliberately every single time  refuses to use the word night and opts for  just the time after sunset - dusk for when darkness BEGINs to set in.   
   
4) The Scripture record no sun  or light source created on Day one. And timing of seasons and days are  only set in day four  


&gt; ""And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.     
&gt;  
&gt;And God saw the light, that *it was* good: and God divided the light from the darkness. ""  


day four is when the Sun is created and its stated there its created to tell time  Nothing in the first day is said to  set a time table.  Durations are set only on day four and only for men who appear in day 6 not for  God.  We have no indication of what this light source was or was not or that even a source existed . None. We know it was light but we get nothing else. It seems to be the physcial creation of light itself if we read it as it is written  


We do know one thing  if we look closer - the creation of this light  had to  be subsequently divided. A separate action is indicated   


&gt;""GOd divided the light from the darkness  


In other words the creation of this light did not necessarily create  shadows or darkness so it was NOT directed from a single source that created  shadows.  (all arguments for a particular location and direction causing shadows of darkness are debunked).  


5) The scripture is CLEAR that events of days with  God at work   with creation ARE NOT the same as After creation and CANNOT BE COMPARED.  They are supernatural .  


&gt;Genesis 2:2   
 And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he  rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.  
   


During creation god set up the universe to continue working without his  direct work.  How we get a man in  day six is not how we get  humans in day seven ( reproduction is  activated). How time passes in reference to tree and  vegetation growth changes.  Days one to six follow no rules of naturalism. They are supernatural. The book of Hebrews underlies this. From the day God  rested we are stiil in his rest non supernatural (so to speak)  


 Hebrews 4

&gt;3 For  we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn  in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were  finished from the foundation of the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.  


God since  day 6  has not been  at the supernatural work of creation. He was in days 1-6 so the conventions and rules are entirely different  


Therefore we CANNOT compare  normal anything to  anything supernatural in  genesis one.  God is setting up the laws of nature, telling them how they will operate and so we can have strange and uncommon things like  days with no sun moon or stars, light that is first undivided and instant tree growth that are entirely different in operation than now.  


These five points alone  (and I could go into a bit more ) defy any claims  of unscripturalness or  compromising of literal interpretation. They are point blank what scripture states and just by themselves  alone it can be **easily** seen that no day can  include night as YECs claim  by including the hours of night to make a 24 hour day.  


That A day is necessarily 24 hours is man made invention that **defies** the text.  


The only ones twisting scripture are those claiming  a day must be what God states a day is not.  


**You compromise the word of God to teach your own traditions.**

Creation,9sy1nv,Kanbei85,YEC,t2_w9cj2,self.Creation,,The days of creation cannot be interpreted as long periods of time,"I was recently challenged on the issue of the length of the 'days' in Genesis by u/Mike_Enders (whom I have subsequently blocked due to his abusive personal attacks). The claim he makes is that since the bible nowhere \*\*specifies\*\* the timespan of these 'days', we cannot assume they lasted 24 hours. If we say they were normal days we are guilty of being promoting 'dogma over scripture', he claims.   


Enders is particularly evasive in that he refuses to admit his motivation for this claim, even when directly asked for it. However, it is very likely to be a desire to inject the millions and billions of years of time, proposed by secular mainstream consensus, into the bible. This would be the motivation for other well-known proponents of the 'day-age' hypothesis such as Hugh Ross.  


Is Enders correct? Can we be faithful to the text and interpret the days as unknown lengths of time? My contention is that there is no way to make any sense of the Bible's account of creation in that way. Enders claims that all we can know from the text is that there was evening and morning-- that's it! Since the sun was not created until day 4, and our days today are measured with reference to the sun, these 'days' must be (or at least could be) something totally different.  


Yet, as I pointed out, our days are not really a function of the sun per se, but rather a function of the speed of the earth's rotation. The sun is a stationary reference point with respect to Earth. Since God created light first, this objection fails. All we need is light coming from a single direction with respect to Earth (which spins), and that is enough to cause 'days' to happen on Earth. There is no indication anywhere in the text, or anywhere else for that matter, that the Earth was spinning at any greatly reduced speed during the Creation Week.   


That is only the tip of the iceberg, though, of the problems created by Enders' proposal. For example, if the 'days' lasted long ages of time, and yet we maintain a literal reading of the text as Enders purports to do, then that means that the entire long age span was filled with daylight! Can you imagine millions of years with no nighttime? What sort of conditions would that produce on Earth? One side would be hot and the other cold.   


The order of creation also fails to match up with even a secular view of reality. Since God created vegetation on a different day from (and prior to) sea life, the evolutionary order of appearance is contradicted. Since God created vegetation on a different 'day' from animal/insect life, we would have plants going for millions of years with no insects to pollinate them.  


The absurdities are all over the place when you take this day-age hypothesis to its logical conclusion! Don't be guilty of mangling the text of Scripture. When God says 'day', we know what that word means (otherwise God would not have used that word, since God is not the author of confusion).

Creation,9st3mr,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.Creation,,Creationist phiosophy again,"The barebones creation theory.

Creator, chooses, spiritual, existence of which is a matter of chosen opinion
Creation, chosen, material, existence of which is a matter of fact forced by evidence

Where choice is the mechanism of creation, defined as making an alternative future the present. 

So then scripture is an application of general creation theory, filling in the variables of the barebones creation principles.

""God created the universe."" God chooses and is therefore spiritual, the universe is chosen and is therefore material. The existence of God is a matter of chosen opinion, the existence of the universe a matter of fact forced by evidence.

The same rules apply to people. Jack chose out of cowardice to run away. The existence of cowardice is a matter of chosen opinion, that he ran away is a matter of fact forced by evidence. 

Contemplate the excellent validation of both opinion and fact, each in their own right, in creationist philosophy. That creationism validates subjective opinion is the most beautiful, important, fantastic and glorious thing, in my opinion. 

This is the underlaying issue what creationism vs evolution is really about, subjective opinion is an inherently creationist concept. 

Anyone who researches evolution theory with a care for what it does to people's comprehension of subjectivity would be horrified at what is happening.

By analogy, I suppose it would be argued by creationists that *all* these vestigial structures have a function, perhaps as yet unknown. But then why the resemblance to terrestrial adaptations?

Creation,9r23tt,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.Creation,,Winning creationism vs evolution by teaching about subjective opinion.,"There are many issues in creationism vs evolution, but I believe the most important issue by far is the issue of subjectivity. What most creationists don't realize is that creationism is a fundamental philosophy which validates both subjective opinion, like opinion about what is beautiful, besides validating objective fact.

Consider how important subjective opinions are, considering that ""importance"" is an opinion. 

Looking at the general structure of a creation theory philosophically, there are two parts, creator and creation. Choice is the mechanism of creation, it is how things originate. Choosing is defined as making an alternative future the present. 

Subjective opinion:
An opinion is formed by choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice.
example: If I say ""Jack is a coward"", then I chose that opinion, and the word ""coward"" refers to the agency of Jack's choices.

Objective fact:
A fact is obtained by evidence of a creation forcing to produce a 1 to 1 corresponding model of it.
example: If I say ""there are five cows in the meadow"", then these words are a essentially a 1 to 1 corresponding model of said cows, forced by the evidence of such.

So we can win creation vs evolution by teaching about facts and opinions in school. This is enormously practically useful understanding, which warrants teaching it. People will be both better at subjective pursuits, and better at objective pursuits, when they have a basic understanding of both. 

So study creationist philosophy and use it in arguing against atheists and evolutionists. Tell them that subjective opinion is a creationist concept, and then you win the argument.

Often it is asked by an evolutionist, who created the creator? Looking at creationist philosophy you can see it is a logical impossiblility to create a creator. Any what is proposed to exist either fits in the creator category or the creation category, it cannot fit in both. So material can be organized in a way that it has a complicated way of making choices, but one cannot create the agency of those choices. Emotions like love and hate, they are motivation of choices, they make choices, therefore they belong in the creator category. Therefore one cannot create love or hate. One cannot just sit back and create glorious happiness, life don't work that way.

So you see, if you study creationist philosophy you can find the arguments to refute atheist arguments. ",70,1540404384,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9r23tt/winning_creationism_vs_evolution_by_teaching/

Creation,9qf7rn,dharmis,Vedic Creationist,t2_ao2uf,self.Creation,,"Creation ex nihilo, ex materia or ex deo? What do you think?","Which creation does your school teach and what are the scriptural (and/or philosophical arguments for it)? I'm not asking for evidence that your scriptures are better than others, simply what does your school maintain about this issue, maybe a few paragraphs and scriptural quotes to illustrate it (like I do below).
I may be under the false impression that all Christians believe in creation ex nihilo so I'd like to use this sub to clarify what various people believe. Also, maybe there are also people from other creeds, including atheists who must also have a theory about creation/appearance of matter/forms in the universe.
The Vaishnava Vedanta school, to which I subscribe, proposes a a sort of creatio ex deo. There is a relationship between God and His Energy (Who is also Himself serving Himself). This relationship is one of simultaneous oneness and difference. God is ultimately one entity, but eternally manifesting as a Divine Couple (God and His Energy, Shaktiman -- the Energetic and Shakti -- the Energy), that's why in Vaishnavism God is always referred to as Radha-Krishna or Lakshmi-Narayana or Shakti-Vishnu. Within God's Energy (the female principle), there are souls, who are mini-Gods, in the sense that they have the same nature as God, but while God is infinite, they are infinitesimal. They are also existing in a relationship of oneness and difference with God (as part of His Energy). You can say that the souls exist within God (since there's nothing that is ontologically not God), but have the free will to reject or love God. And God facilitates this rejection in a certain way.
In this theological context, creation means two things. The eternal creation (which is mostly the structure of God, His relationship with His Energy and parts of His energy -- the souls). It is not creatio ex nihilo, because God and His Energy exists eternally and they are eternally in relationship of exchanging love. So here creation would mean more of an arrangement, a structure. There's nothing being generated out of nothing.
The secondary creation is that of the material world, which is happening within God's Energy and is a place for souls to choose 'Not God'. To separate themselves from God. God injects the information about the material world (as ideas negating His qualities) and a part of His Energy called Maha-Maya (the 'external' energy) makes this world and then the souls choose it as their destination of experiencing what it's like to be away from God. This material creation is temporary and it is being 'created' and 'destroyed' in the sense that the information on a DVD disk is created or destroyed. If a Vaishnava would read the book of Genesis, for instance, they would map it to this form of creation from the Vedas. But this is just to illustrate the type of creation. In between the stages of material creation and destruction there is a long period of formlessness, where the souls are dormant and unconscious and matter is in a state lacking information, so there's nothing to distinguish, like a 'cosmic night'.
This is in short, the Vaishnava view of creation. To sum up, it's ultimately creatio ex deo, but with the notion of simultaneous oneness and difference, and also the distinction between primary creation and secondary creation. God can both be a source and stand separate from His creation. Some quotes in the Bhagavad Gita are relevant here:
"" I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.""
""By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.""
""And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation.""
""Understand that as the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, rests always in the sky, all created beings rest in Me.""
""The whole cosmic order is under Me. Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again, and under My will it is annihilated at the end.""
""O Dhanañjaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral.""
""This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, producing all moving and nonmoving beings. Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.""",10,1540224412,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9qf7rn/creation_ex_nihilo_ex_materia_or_ex_deo_what_do/

It is all so obvious that nobody is writing books arguing for or against design. It's like the acceptance of the law of gravity. Also, everyone accepts the universe is created and didn't just Big Bang itself into existence and that it was created.

However, there is no clear indication on who the designer is. Just that it must be some kind of all-powerful being. What do you think would happen next? Or what should happen? What would you personally do? Would you now go through various religious traditions and try to find more about the designer? Would you simply worship a generic designer?

I'm new on this channel, I'm french, 29 years old (forgive my bad english...). I have a PhD in oncology and I discovered scientific creationism three years ago. I adopted the young earth creationism model and catholicism since then. I didn't get any religious education and grew up in a environment which was quite atheist but I was rationally convinced by the christian metaphysics, its dogmas and its scientific model relative to our origins. 

I never posted anything here but I have been reading your publications for almost a year now, it is a great source of inspiration and always very instructive. I have a facebook page in french on which I try to transmit the scientific knowledge that I have on this topic (1000 followers and thousands of haters :p ). unfortunately we don't have powerful creationist organizations here in France (which used to be a christian country…) so I try to inform people in the best way I can. 

God inspired me a metaphor that I like a lot and I would like to share it with you and have your opinion about it guys.   
Do you think that a Biblic Kind can be compared to a rubik's cube? You can change the combination of faces and create many different results but your cube will always stay a cube. The form will not change; like in the real world a feline stays a feline or a human stays human: no transformation. Evolution won't transform anything, just modulate and rearrange preexisting information (represented here by the faces of different colors).  The combination modulation of the rubies' cube faces can represent mutations, allelic recombination or epigenetics modifications.   
I think this image is quite cool, even if it's not perfect (because it does not integrate the genetic loss or the possible gains by horizontal gene transfer).

Muller won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1946:
https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1946/summary/

If the offspring of the next generation are sufficiently worse on average than their parents, there is a point at which it doesn't matter that the fittest in a given generation survive because the fittest in that generation were not as fit as the prior generation!  This is the limit beyond which natural selection will fail to keep the species progressing and which will lead to genetic deterioration of function.

The limit is the number of bad mutations per generation per individual.  That limit is computed based on the number of live birth offspring on average the species has.

The numbers floated around for humans are between 0.5 - 2.0 bad mutations per generation per individual.

From Larry Moran's Sandwalk just a few years back:
http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-creationist-tries-to-understand.html

&gt;Sal Cordova is correct that if the deleterious mutation rate is too high, the species will go extinct. We don't know the exact minimum number of deleterious mutations that have to happen per generation in order to cause a problem. It's probably less than two (2). It's probably not as low as 0.5. It should be no more than 1 or 2 deleterious mutations per generation. 

That's the limit for humans.  The estimated number of mutations in humans is about 100 per generation per individual.  Given that 99% of mutations are bad, if the genome is 100% functional, well then we're waaaay beyond Muller's limit.  If the genome is only 8% functional, that's still 8 mutations, and beyond Muller's limit.

She described her research in 1996 this way:

https://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/publications/Arnold_ChemeSci1996.pdf


&gt;**DIRECTED EVOLUTION**: CREATING BIOCATALYSTS FOR THE FUTURE

&gt;An effective approach to engineering enzymes is to direct their evolution in vitro.  By directing key processes of Darwinian evolution in the test tube....

BUT, what she is really doing is selective breeding which was done by creationists and others long before Darwin!

From Wiki:

&gt;Selective breeding of both plants and animals has been practiced since early prehistory; key species such as wheat, rice, and dogs have been significantly different from their wild ancestors for millennia, and maize, which required especially large changes from teosinte, its wild form, was selectively bred in Mesoamerica. Selective breeding was practiced by the Romans.[3] Treatises as much as 2,000 years old give advice on selecting animals for different purposes, and these ancient works cite still older authorities, such as Mago the Carthaginian.[4] The notion of selective breeding was later expressed by the Persian Muslim polymath Abu Rayhan Biruni in the 11th century. He noted the idea in his book titled India, which included various examples.[5] 


&gt;&gt;The agriculturist selects his corn, letting grow as much as he requires, and tearing out the remainder. The forester leaves those branches which he perceives to be excellent, whilst he cuts away all others. The bees kill those of their kind who only eat, but do not work in their beehive.

&gt;&gt;— Abu Rayhan Biruni, India

&gt;Selective breeding was established as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. Arguably, his most important breeding program was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.[6] 


Bakewell contributed to the field of ARTIFICIAL selection.  However, evolutionary theory has so poisoned culture, what is man-made and intelligently created evolution is called Darwinian evolution.

In fact Darwin made the distinction between intelligently designed artificial selection and natural selection:

&gt;Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the co-adaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection.[7]

&gt;— Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species

Darwin was wrong about the power of natural selection, but he was correct to make a distinction that artificial selection is NOT Darwinian selection.

Oh well, evolutionists have some new false claim to brag about and by saying intelligently DIRECTED EVOLUTION is proof of universal common descent  by unintelligent UN-directed evolution.

This is highly flawed for the single fact that a high per nucleotide mutation rate, as your paper demonstrates, doesn't translate into a high overall real mutation rate. HIV [for example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002251) has the highest per nucleotide mutation rate of any organism at (4.1 ± 1.7) × 10−3  per nucleotide. However, HIV only has ~9200 nucleotides which, if multiplied, turns out to be only about 38 mutations per generation. This is far lower than the human average at about 100. On top of this, the high reproduction rate of viruses means that they are better suited to avoid mutational load. This is because you'll have more variation ( in the amount of mutations) with more offspring than with less. This allows much more room for selection of lower mutated offspring than with mammals with lower reproduction rates.",18,1538345192,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9kahoa/low_hanging_fruit_argument_debate_evolution/

I call it the ""Bonkers Equation"" in honor of Dan Graur who used the word to describe an unsolved problem in evolutionary biology which led to absurdities.

Here is my derivation of the ""Bonkers Equation"" independent of models of fitness, but based simply on reasonable and accepted models of inheritance:

http://www.creationevolutionuniversity.com/science/?p=22

I think, however, the concepts just fly over the heads of the members of yonder sub reddit r/debateevolution.

One can use the ""bonkers"" equation to arrive at similar numbers as evolutionary biologist Dan Graur in his rant:

&gt;If 80% of the genome is functional, as trumpeted by ENCODE Project Consortium (2012), then 45-82 deleterious mutations arise per generation. For the human population to maintain its current population size under these conditions, each of us should have on average 3 × 1019 to 5 × 10^35 (30,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) children. 
&gt;**This is clearly bonkers. **

Now, some people have tried to resolve the problems posed by the Bonkers Equation with things like synergistic epsitasis (whatever that means), soft-selection, etc. etc.   Sanford argues those proposed solultions don't solve the problem of the absurdities, the bonkers conclusions, of evolutionary biology taken to its logical conclusions.  

Sanford shows the flaws of the proposed solutions to the bonkers problem through software simulations with Mendel's Accountant. BUT, the important thing is Genetic Entropy is an EXPERIMENTALLY TESTABLE hypothesis. 

At NIH meetings I and others have attended, talk of 2-20 million humang genomes may be sequenced in the near future in connection with tracking heritable diseases.  We may know, experimentally who is closer to the truth, Sanford or his critics.

Additionally, Gruar is railing and name calling the hundreds of NIH researchers at prestigious institutions like Harvard, John Hopkins, Stanford, MIT, etc.  (BAD idea).  Graur is calling the ignoramuses and crooks.

I am trying to find a very specific type of creationist. I am trying to find a Young Earth Creationist who believes in Flat Earth.

A former classmate of mind has adopted some very niche and radical views and I want to understand where they come from. Her views are that the Earth is Young(~6000 years) **AND** is **flat**.

That's a loss of over 95% of the bases!

Ironically Darwinists hailed this as a tremendous validation of Natural Selection.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegelman%27s_Monster

But if this is an illustration of ""beneficial"" mutation or ""positive"" selection, this does not bode well for a Darwin's theory that claims to explain the evolution of complex organisms like humans.

The net average expression of ""beneficial"" mutations (aside from things like plasmid acquisition) and ""positive"" selection when carefully scrutinized involves LOSS of capability.  Why is that? 

Well, consider the scene in the movie 5 weeks in a balloon where people were on an adventure in a balloon and then encounter distress when the balloon began to fail.  What did they do?  They started throwing everything but the absolute essentials over board in order to keep flying.

Well, just like Spiegelman's monster, creatures gain reproductive advantage in specialized environments my disposing of stuff they don't need in that immediate environment but which would be useful in another environment.  This increases metabolic efficiency in the short term at the risk of loss in the long term. The net result is not constructive but DESTRUCTIVE.

Futhermore, selection for a trait  AFTER it already exists is not evidence selection will be there for the trait BEFORE it exists.  Stanley Salthe  observed that when evolutionary biologists are asked which traits are most likely to evolve, they respond that its the traits under the LEAST selection, not the ones under the most selection.

Example, consider your insulin regulated metabolism.  Well without insulin, you die.  The evolutionary biologist will naively say, ""see, that's proof selection favors insulin, hence it evolved by selection.""  Wrong wrong wrong.

If creature needed insulin to begin with and it wasn't there to begin with, the creature is dead.  Thus it cannot evolve!  The alternative then is to assume the creature didn't really need insulin, thus the insulin regulated metabolism could evolve without killing the organism.  Ok, well and fine, but that's proof, for things to evolve it needs to be free of natural selection.  

Natural selection thus prevents evolution of complexity, it doesn't facilitate it.  If anything, Natural Selection is an agent for DESTRUCTION of complexity no CONSTRUCTION of complexity.

Additionally, these tandem repeats are a host to modifiable chromatin.  Chromatin is like RAM memory.  I pointed out the silliness of assuming repetitive elements are necessarily junk here with the illustration of repetitive elements in a computer server farm:

https://crev.info/2018/01/junk-dna-may-act-computer-memory/

So, evolutionary biologist for a long time have been saying ERVs are junk because copies of the supposedly litter the genome with no known function.  Well, if experience is a guide, usually such evolutionary predictions get over turned in light of new and REAL data:

&gt;TEs endow the genomes of their host species with binding sites for transcription factors, which can then contribute to species-restricted phenotypes (reviewed by Thompson et al., 2016). For instance, mammals generally produce amylase in the pancreas, yet primates can release this enzyme in saliva too, owing to the insertion upstream of the amylase coding sequence of a HERV-E LTR driving expression in the salivary glands (Samuelson et al., 1996; Ting et al., 1992). Many other cases of LTR promoter exaptation have been documented, generally resulting in new or altered tissue-specific gene expression (Cohen et al., 2009; Stavenhagen and Robins, 1988; Rebollo et al., 2012a). Examples of TE-based species-specific enhancers also exist, and in mammals include MER130 elements acting as neocortex-specific units (Notwell et al., 2015), a SINE integrant functioning as a distal enhancer of Fgf8 in the diencephalon (Nakanishi et al., 2012), RLTR13D5 ERVs co-opted as placenta-specific enhancers (Chuong et al., 2013), and the MER41-mediated dispersion of interferon-responsive elements in primates (Chuong et al., 2016). Retroelements can also contribute to embryonic stem cell (ESC) regulatory networks; many binding sites for pluripotency factors [such as Oct4 (Pou5f1) and Nanog] reside within primate- or human-specific ERVs in the human genome (Bourque et al., 2008). In addition, LTR elements are implicated in the regulation of specific genes in early embryogenesis (Bourque et al., 2008; Fort et al., 2014; Macfarlan et al., 2012; Peaston et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2014; Goke et al., 2015; Kunarso et al., 2010). TEs are also frequently bound by p53 (Trp53), with more than one-third of the genomic targets of this tumor suppressor overlapping with primate-specific ERVs (Wang et al., 2007), hence at locations not found for instance in the mouse genome. Finally, ERV-derived proteins can themselves be sources of genetic diversity, as illustrated in placental mammals in which formation of the syncytiotrophoblast, a placenta layer with extensive cellular fusion, is mediated by ERV envelope-derived syncytins (Mi et al., 2000; Dupressoir et al., 2009, 2011). Interestingly, across mammals, these proteins derive from the env gene of distinct groups of ERVs, indicating convergent evolution with multiple and independent events of ERV co-option (Lavialle et al., 2013). Together, these findings highlight the huge impact that TEs can have on the evolution [sic] and biology of complex organisms.

Incidentally, these finding were in a paper I indirectly cited regarding Orphan and Taxonomically Restricted Genes, specifically the KRAB-ZnF/ZFP family, many of which members interact with ERVs.

DISCLOSURE: I am a post baccalaureate research fellow at the NIH. Any of my views and communications here and elsewhere do not represent any positions held by the NIH and are personal in nature.

Event Link (Direct isn't working for me so copy the link into your search bar)

The email I received about this explicitly states ""All Intramural Clinicians, Investigators, Staff and Trainees, as well as Extramural affiliates and academic scientists and clinicians outside the NIH are welcome to attend."" (emphasis mine). Since there's an open invitation, I'm taking the personal liberty to invite members of our community here engaging in academic or clinical research in the area to attend. The full abstract is below.

Mueller published his famous paper, Our Load of Mutations, in 1950. Since then there has been a growing realization that any type of population can potentially undergo mutational meltdown, given the right circumstances. Indeed, it is widely believed that the human race may presently be in error catastrophe. I have been studying this problem for roughly 18 years. The simple logic of genetic degeneration is summarized in the book Genetic Entropy (Sanford. J.C. 2014. Genetic Entropy. Fourth edition. FMS Publications. Waterloo, NY).

In 2005, my colleagues and I developed the numerical simulation Mendel’s Accountant, which simulates the mutation/selection process in a manner that can be comprehensive and biologically realistic. We have used this genetic tool to better understand how deleterious, near-neutral, and beneficial mutations accumulate over time, and how these mutations affect population fitness. When given any parameter settings that are even remotely reasonable, we consistently see that deleterious mutation count per individual increases linearly, while fitness decreases either linearly or as a smooth downward decay curve (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). The steadily increasing deleterious mutation count and the resulting fitness decline are primarily due to the fact that most non-neutral mutations have very slight fitness effects (i.e., they are near neutral), so they tend to be essentially invisible to natural selection. This problem grows much more acute when mutation rates approach one or more mutations per individual per generation. When this happens, such mutations accumulate faster than selection can possibly remove them, greatly accelerating genetic loss and resulting in error catastrophe. Our simulations show that it is surprisingly difficult to stop the continuous accumulation of deleterious mutations, and it is surprisingly difficult to amplify enough beneficial mutations so as to achieve any net gain in population fitness. Our studies indicate that these theoretical concerns are most acute in man, but are also very serious in other higher organisms that are diploid and have long generation times. These theoretical problems appear to even apply to certain bacteria and viruses.

We did simulations of bacteria and virus, to investigate if these organisms might possibly also be subject to net genetic loss by modeling E.coli-like bacterium and an influenza-like virus (Brewer, W.; Smith, F. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Information loss: potential for accelerating natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses ,In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (369-384)). In both cases we saw systematic net genetic loss. We then analyzed the real-world mutation accumulation pattern in the famous LTEE E. coli project, and the historical mutation accumulation in the H1N1 human strain of the influenza virus. Our results show that in the bacterial LTEE project, all of the documented “beneficial” mutations were reductive in nature, involving loss-of-function. This even applied to the citrate-uptake promoter mutation – which involved the loss of a regulatory function. This means that even while the E coli strains were adapting to the artificial in vitro conditions, the strains’ total functionality (as applicable to variable natural environments), was declining (i.e., reductive evolution) https://www.logosra.org/lenski. Likewise, we showed that the human H1N1 influenza strain had a perfectly linear rate of mutation accumulation over the last 100 years, such that 100f the genome was mutated. This linear accumulation was accompanied by a smooth and continuous decline in virulence, until the human H1N1 strain went “extinct” in 2009 (i.e., disappeared from the influenza database) (Carter R.C. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2012). A new look at an old virus: patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling 9:42doi:10.1186/1742-4682-9-42).

Do beneficial mutations out-weigh the effect of deleterious mutations? We have studied various systems to understand some of the limitations of beneficial mutations. It is well documented that beneficial mutations are very rare, and this should be obvious. However, beneficial mutations are problematic for many other reasons. First, we used simulations to show that the large majority of beneficial mutations should be nearly-neutral and so cannot be selectively amplified (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). Second, our simulations confirm “Haldane’s Dilemma” and also “Haldane’s Ratchet” (simultaneous selection for even a modest number of beneficial mutations requires deep time, yet that amount of time causes a vastly larger number of nearly-neutral deleterious mutations to go to fixation). Lastly, our simulations show that when a beneficial function cannot be selectively favored until a string of two or more specific mutations arises, the waiting times can become extremely prohibitive (Sanford, J., Brewer, W., Smith F., and Baumgardner, J. 2015. The Waiting Time Problem in a Model Hominin Population. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling12:18).

It has been widely claimed that Fisher’s Theorem proves that as long as there is genetic variation in a population, fitness will always increase. We have shown mathematically that Fisher’s formulation was in error, and we have corrected his formulation. With this correction, the math indicates that net gain in fitness is very problematic – as is consistent with our numerical simulations (Basener, W., Sanford J. 2017. The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection with Mutations. Journal of Mathematical Biology. Volume 76, Issue 7, pp 1589–1622).

The Avida program is a simulation that shows net genetic gain. However, we have shown that Avida’s net gain requires that its beneficial mutations are assigned extremely unrealistic fitness effects (every beneficial mutation will double fitness). When realistic fitness effects are applied, there is always a fitness loss, converging to zero (Nelson, C.W. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2011). The Effects of Low-Impact Mutations in Digital Organisms. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, Vol. 8, (April 2011), p. 9., Nelson, C.; &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Computational evolution experiments reveal a net loss of genetic information despite selection, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (338-368)). Perhaps the most famous beneficial mutation is the NylB frameshift mutation. We have shown that this famous beneficial mutation actually never happened and that the NylB protein is not a novel protein, but is a widely distributed enzyme that has been present for a long time http://vixra.org/abs/1708.0370

Two hypothetical solutions to the problem of continuous net degeneration have been proposed. These possible solutions are the synergistic epistasis mechanism and the mutation count mechanism. We tested both of these mechanisms using numerical simulations. Even using the most generous settings, the synergistic epistasis mechanism accelerated genetic decline and led to rapid extinction (Baumgardner J.; Brewer, W.; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Synergistic Epistasis Halt Mutation Accumulation? Results from Numerical Simulation, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (312-337)). Likewise, when we tested the mutation count mechanism, the fitness declined rapidly - except under highly artificial circumstances (i.e., where all mutations had an equal effect - which allowed mutations to stop accumulating) (Brewer, W.; Baumgardner, J. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Using Numerical Simulation to Test the “Mutation-Count” Hypothesis, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp 298-311)).

The theoretical problem of continuous deleterious mutation accumulation has been acknowledged by most leading population geneticists ever since Muller published his paper in 1950. The greatest concern is the possible degeneration of the human population, which may result from both genetic and epigenetic mutations. I suggest that investigation into methods to reduce human mutation rates is highly warranted.

Creation,9i05ej,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Different Approach to Problem of Orphan and TRG genes/proteins,"[**advanced topic in biophyiscs/molecular biology/structural biolog**]

An orphan gene is a gene found only in a species and an TRG (taxonomically restricted gene) is a gene found only in a group of species.  This is problematic for arguing universal common ancestry since it means some proteins have no traceable ancestor, possible even in principle.  

A Darwinist will say, ""well it has an ancestor, we just don't know what it is.""  To which I'll say, ""if you don't know, why don't you just admit you don't know, and instead say, you only BELIEVE it has an ancestor in the absence of evidence. And furthermore, it shows how useless it is to BELIEVE it has a common ancestor as far REAL science is concerned where observable facts take priority over beliefs without evidence.""

Most of what I'm about to say floats over the head of most Evolutionary Biologists I've encountered.  Since I studied evolutionary biology at the graduate level, I know how to play their game, but more importantly I'm learning how to beat them at their own game. Evolutionary biologists don't usually have the background and logic skills to see problems in their own theories.

Don't be put off by the technical jargon you are about to see, just look at the following two pictures at the end of this OP.

Evolutionary biology is based a lot on cherry picking data and avoiding really hard questions.  

In the following two diagrams, you'll see little colored boxed which highlight major functional components of proteins. You'll see the protein Topoisomerase 2A has a totally different set of functional components than KRAB ZNF.  

I posed this question over at r/debate evolution, and I got no answers:

&gt;""According to evolutionary theory, did all proteins descend from a single ancestral protein?""

Well, it's understandable I got no responses since its obviously difficult to argue all proteins descended from a universal common ancestor protein, and assuming it did, the assumption is utterly useless since all one really needs to do REAL biology (vs. speculating on useless evolutionary stories) is to note ""similar things behave in similar ways, and those that aren't similar don't""  Like, DUH!  You don't need the assumption of Universal Common Ancestry (UCA) to see that, just an assumption of common pattern, common architecture, dare I say,  common DESIGN!

Anyway, let the reader see whether insistence on Universal Common Ancestry will help you understand protein architecture:

Creation,9hprui,dharmis,Vedic Creationist,t2_ao2uf,self.Creation,,Comparing Christian and Vedic creationism,"I've been on this sub for some years now and I've yet to meet a Vedic creationist so I'll assume I'm the only one (Anyone out there?).

What I see in discussions here is that once one assumes/proves the theory of evolution wrong, the next stage is to hint or directly refer to the Christian creation theory as the right way to go. 

But why not the Vedic theory? If you're a Christian, what do you know about the Vedic theory of creation and if you know anything and you find it lacking, what particularly do you find lacking? What is superior to the Christian theory relative to the Vedic one?

For a succint view of Vedic creationism here it goes:

God in His many forms (Krishna, Narayana, Vishnu etc ) has always existed in the spiritual world, along with the souls, which are sparks of Himself with the free will to either love Him or reject Him. 

When a soul, out of free will, develops an aversion to God, perhaps wanting to become God himself, the soul goes into the material world, which is especially created for souls to experience how God is not (also called Maha-Maya). This is an elaborate illusion, where the souls feels independent and that they are making things happen, when in fact the only thing the souls can do is choose X or Y, and then the material nature under God's control (and that of his servants) makes it happen for that soul, subject to the law of karma, which is the organising principle of the material world.

The material plane of existence is split in multiple universes (called brahmanda) each presided by a demiurge, called Brahma, which is a role that can be occupied by a normal, pious soul.

 This Brahma organizes the internal kitchen of each universe, manifesting various forms (aided by his sons, progenitors) and setting the principles of the universal laws. The information and power for all of this Brahma gets by worshipping God (Vishnu), who appears to him and gives him the whole plan. But Brahma's pleasure, a material desire, is to do the actual application of this. In the Vedic scriptures Brahma is depicted as being born in the darkness of the primordial universe and being scared. He then hears a voice that says to relax and meditate and then he gets the revelation of Vishnu and the spiritual world and he is reminded how he got there: he wanted to create a universe. It is interesting how God himself has to remind Brahma of his own previous desires, which is how it's also happening for us at every moment. God is always reminding us what we want to do and these desires gradually come up from what is called ""the unconsious"", for fulfilment at the conscious level.

Anyway, once Brahma is reminded what to do, he meditates for the equivalent of billions of human years, and then he receives the information. He then gives birth (from his various body parts) to his sons, the progenitors, who further assist him into manifesting various forms, species, planets etc.

The desire of the souls to experience life without God is the purpose of the material universe. Another purpose is the desire of God to have an image of what He is not. These are related, because in order for the Absolute to be complete, He also has to also contain its opposite. Also, in order for the souls to truly love God they must also be able to choose not-God, even if it  is an illusion.

As an aside, there was an old French movie where a husband wants to be unfaithful to his wife and the wife discovers this and so she dresses as a prostitute and hooks up with him. The man thinks he's having a relationship with two women and, morally speaking, he is an adulterer, although the other woman is also his wife. But he doesn't know it and the state of consciousness is all that matters.

Similarly, but not perfectly analogous, God creates a symbol of what He doesn't like, not-God, called the material world, as both a way to have complete knowledge of Himself and also for the souls to be able to choose to love Him.

The material world is the opposite of the nature of God and the soul: it is asat (unconscious) instead of sat (conscious), it is full of ignorance (achit) instead of full of knowledge (chit) and it is full of suffering (nirananda) instead of full of bliss (ananda).

To aid in the desire of the soul to live in the material world, which is something that resides in the soul as a desire,  the universe has 7 layers that envelop the soul and his desire: six are subtle matter and one is gross matter. From highest to lowest: moral principles (mahattatva), ego, intellect, mind, senses , sensations and the flesh body.
  
If a soul wants to enjoy stuff without God he has the material world and millions and millions of types of mind-body combinations to do so, made up of the seven layers. He can be an eagle, a worm, an ant or a human being. 

What is special about humans is that only as a human being a soul can get out of the material world. Humans are meant for God-realization and that is the prime purpose of human life. So, in a way, humans are privileged because they alone are given the opportunities and abilities (intellect) to figure out a way out of the material world. 

Once a soul is in the human form of life he is supposed to inquire about God and develop a relationship with God and, ultimately, to go back to God. 

This is just a short summary. What would be the Christian version of this and what is your opinion on the Vedic model relative to the Christian one?

I responded with my beloved OEC Richard Smalley:

&gt;RICHARD SMALLEY – NOBEL LAUREATE IN CHEMISTRY

&gt;Nobel Prize: Richard Smalley (1943-2005) won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of fullerenes – the third elemental form of carbon (along with graphite and diamond). Upon his passing, the US Senate passed a resolution to honor Smalley, crediting him as the “Father of Nanotechnology.”


&gt;Education: Ph.D. in chemistry, Princeton University (USA), 1973

&gt;Occupation: Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Physics at Rice University in Houston, Texas (1981-2005)




&gt;1. “Recently I have gone back to church regularly with a new focus to understand as best I can what it is that makes Christianity so vital and powerful in the lives of billions of people today, even though almost 2000 years have passed since the death and resurrection of Christ.

&gt;Although I suspect I will never fully understand, I now think the answer is very simple: it’s true. God did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago, and of necessity has involved Himself with His creation ever since. The purpose of this universe is something that only God knows for sure, but it is increasingly clear to modern science that the universe was exquisitely fine-tuned to enable human life. We are somehow critically involved in His purpose. Our job is to sense that purpose as best we can, love one another, and help Him get that job done.” (Smalley 2005).

&gt;2. The books ‘Origins of Life’ and ‘Who Was Adam?’ are authored by Dr. Hugh Ross (astrophysicist) and Dr. Fazale Rana (biochemist). Richard Smalley had this to say about these books:

&gt;“Evolution has just been dealt its death blow. After reading ‘Origins of Life’, with my background in chemistry and physics, it is clear evolution could not have occurred. The new book, ‘Who Was Adam?’, is the silver bullet that puts the evolutionary model to death.” (Smalley 2005a).

&gt;3. In his address at the Tuskegee University’s 79th Annual Scholarship Convocation (October 3, 2004) Smalley mentioned the ideas of evolution versus creationism, Darwin versus the Bible’s ‘Genesis’; then he pointed out:

&gt;“The burden of proof is on those who don’t believe that ‘Genesis’ was right, and there was a creation, and that Creator is still involved.” (Smalley 2004).

Creation,9hek5f,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Revision of Pascal's Wager for the Creation Evolution Controversy,"From Wiki:

&gt;Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in Hell).[2]

I will not defend or promote Pascal's Wager as proof of God or reason to accept a claim as fact.  I mainly use it as a device to point out the silliness of investing so much of one's life in a theory of Universal Common Ancestry that has no little value to science or for giving a person meaning in life.

What advocates of Universal Common Ancestry claim is the evolutionary theory enables medical research because of comparative anatomy.  Well, one can do comparative anatomy without the assumption of Universal Common Ancestry, and in fact, comparative anatomy began with Creationists like Richard Owen who pioneered the field. Owen argued the patterns of similarity are evidence of a common design, not common descent.  

Furthermore, the common design among major groups also prevents one thing from evolving to another.  A fish will evolve only to become other fish, not birds and trutles and rabbits as evolutionary biologists claim. That is to say, the fundamental design of each group is immutable and can't be broken without killing the creature.  To paraphrase Hoyle, ""potatoes can't evolve to be rabbits.""

The design of each major group is relatively immutable, and the mechanistic reasons for this immutability become more obvious as we learn more.

The only thing needed for comparative anatomy is the observation that ""things that are similar are similar, and things that are different are different."" Like, duh!  There is no need at the root to assume common ancestry.  In fact, the assumption of common ancestry leads to a lot of epicycles such as trying to explain why human introns are more similar to a plant like A. Thaliana than to other animals!
https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7nbmeu/humans_gene_introns_closer_to_the_plant/

So if the assumption of universal common ancestry has no value to science, why insist on it?

Evolutionists will argue we need evolutionary theory to understand antibiotic resistance.  Well, that's equivocating (that is saying one thing, but meaning another).  Evolution of antibiotic resistance isn't based on Universal Common Ancestry! It is based on Blyth's ideas, which Darwin Plagiarized, that Species are PRESERVED by natural selection, they are not originated by natural selection.  

There are obvious limits to the transformation because the fundamental design at some point is immutable, otherwise the organism dies.  E. Coli bacteria begins as E. Coli bacteria in Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE), it ends as E. Coli bacteria at the end of Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment.  For all the hype of LTEE, what Lenski achieved was evolving a strain of E. Coli that can't survive in the wild!

When I had bouts of agnosticism and nearly left the Christian faith, I became actually thrilled to hang out with atheists and agnostics who made fun of some of the illogic I was hearing from some Christians, like the guy who said, ""If the Bible said 2 + 2 = 5, I'd believe it.""  It was nice for a changed to be appreciated for asking tough questions, for expressing skepticism, rather than being condemned and ostracized for it as I was in some church circles when I asked question like, ""God appeared to Paul, why not to me?"" 

But then, the point came, I asked the atheists, ""what if Darwin was right, what good will it do for me?""  At that point, I said, ""nothing personal, but maybe I'll go search somewhere else for meaning in life, because there is no salvation in the name of Charles Darwin.""

NOTES:
Pascal's Wager in the original form that famous mathematician Blaise  Pascal framed it can be criticized or defended on many levels.

That mathematical motivation of Pascal's wager is very much related to his actual practical work on gambling theory which lead to a body of mathematical theory that is a part of physics, finance, math and probability theory, namely the concept of ""Expect Value"" or ""Expectation Value.""  You'll notice that I try to frame the problems with abiogenesis and evolutionary theory in terms of violation so ""expected outcome"" which is analogous to the problems of violating ""expected value"" or the ""law of large numbers.""

Creation,9h4sbh,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,Darwinist Hypocrisy About The Quality and Value of Their Beliefs to Society,"So I asked some Darwinists what would count as evidence of a Creator God. One said, ""nothing"" at the DiscussEvolution Discord server.  That was an honest answer. Kudos for honesty.

Some other Darwinists punted and didn't give an answer, another said, ""I don't know in advance what would count as evidence, it's impossible to know what would be positive evidence for creation.""  So that's an admission he doesn't know even in principle what would be evidence of creation!   He admitted he accepted evolution based on FAITH, not formal proof.

Regarding creation and ID, at least I said, I don't think there is DIRECT evidence, maybe formal proof is impossible.

Many of the Darwinists will say, ""creationists don't believe in evolution because they are scientifically illiterate, they believe in some imaginary being. They have no DIRECT evidence. Time to grow up.""

But let's turn the tables.   They don't have direct evidence either!!  In physics, for example, we can repeat the measurement of gravitational acceleration near the Earth's surface.  That is a repeatable experiment.

In contrast evolutionists can't give direct evidence that a giraffe and a tree descended from some ancestor, let us call it ""great great....grandma.""  So what did it physically look like, and why is it reasonable that a tree and giraffe could descend from that ancestor.  A giraffe has a heart, it has legs, it can walk, see and hear.  A tree? Well it can't do that because it's a tree.

So I point out to them, they don't know how evolution actually worked, they only guess, they can't demonstrate from actual principles of physics and chemistry nor from experiment that a giraffe and a tree could in fact descend from a common ancestor.  They can't demonstrate from physics and chemistry that natural selection will work as claimed.  I point out to them the net average result of natural selection is LOSS or DESTRUCTION of function, not construction of function.  So if the net direction of evolution is toward simplicity (reductive evolution), then how did complexity evolve.  The only place the net direction of natural selection is toward more complexity is in the imagination of evolutionist, not in DIRECT lab and field observations.

They are left in the unfortunate position of describing changes that in sum total look miraculous.  Ah they irony, a theory that claims to be natural needs the equivalent of supernatural miracles to rescue it.  

So their evidence is lousy,  so bad that even a renowned evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne said, 

&gt;In science's pecking order, evolutionary biology lurks somewhere near the bottom, far closer to [the pseudo science of] phrenology than to physics.

At least three regular participants here a r/creation have physics degrees (myself included).  Relative to the major theories of physics, evolutionary biology has no direct experiments, only silly claims based on what they advertise as relevant experiments.  They point to antibiotic resistance and Galopagos finch birds, etc. Well, the problem is these experiments could just as well be interpreted to show there are limits to evolution.  No matter how much selection pressure and mutation is applied, a bacteria remains a bacteria, it would appear it would take a miracle for the bacteria to become a Eukaryote like a human.

One can't, to paraphrase physicist Fred Hoyle, evolve a potato into a rabbit.

Further, the claim of universal common ancestry is worthless to operational science.  Evolutionists will say, ""well we're able to use lab rats to study humans because of the belief of common descent.""  

Unfortunately for them, creationists were the pioneers of comparative anatomy.  Creationist Richard Owen (who was critical of Darwin), was the one who coined the word ""homology"" that was based on the observed common design in creatures.  And it was creationist Edward Blyth who actually put forward the ideas of indefinite radiation and natural selection (ideas which Darwin plagiarized, distorted and gave no appropriate credit to Blyth).  

[See this book by the Provost of an Ivy League School:
https://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Mysterious-Mr-Evolutionists-Harvest/dp/0156239493]

So the quality of Darwinist beliefs in Universal Common Ancestry lacks direct evidence, and its value to science is next to nothing.  Yet they insist one is illiterate if one doesn't agree with their professions of faith.  And Darwinism is FAITH, it is not, compared to theories in physics and chemistry, real science.",46,1537360768,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9h4sbh/darwinist_hypocrisy_about_the_quality_and_value/
Creation,9gw9t2,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,"What would count as direct evidence of Christian Creationism, some interesting responses","In Christian Creationism (OEC and YEC), the most important claim is not creationism in and of itself, but rather God is real and is God the Christian God.  Now there are Christian Darwinists, I think they are mistaken, but if they have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, according to my reading of the Bible, they will be spared from judgement.

However, my question was directed at the rabid anti-Christian crowd over yonder.  Someone asked if there is direct evidence of creationism.  I said, in effect, ""no"", but:
&gt;Would burning in hell for eternity one day count as direct evidence for you? That is a testable claim.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9gngb4/direct_evidence_of_creationism/e672vmu


The point is, unless there are consequences, most questions about evolution are purely academic and really have little to no bearing on science, even medical science.  Witness all the creationist protestant doctors, medical researchers, and engineers in the most technologically advanced society in history!  So why should the Darwinists care unless they are making money from the idea?

When I was early in the creation evolution debate, an OEC by the name of Richard Deem responded to the criticisms that Christian Creationism isn't testable.  He said in effect, ""if you kill yourself today, you might find out.""  So what is my point?  Why should creationist worry about persuading Darwinists?  God will deal with them in due time, if indeed there is a Creator and He is the Christian God.  Other Deities, I cannot speak for....

The reason to I debate Darwinists is to see if they can persuade me that I'm wrong. They've done an outstanding job, actually, of persuading me that I'm right!!!

The headline and first line of this article was:

&gt;""Most doctors favor evolution theory
&gt;
&gt;A national survey of 1,472 physicians indicates more than half -- 63 percent -- believe the theory of &gt;evolution over that of intelligent design.""

But that also means a sizable fraction of doctors favor ID! That would be something like 37%?

&gt;When asked whether they agree more with intelligent design or evolution, 88 percent of Jewish doctors and 60 percent of Roman Catholic physicians said they agree more with evolution, while 54 percent of Protestant doctors agreed more with intelligent design.

&gt;When asked whether intelligent design has legitimacy as science, 83 percent of Jewish doctors and 51 percent of Catholic doctors said they believe intelligent design is simply ""a religiously inspired pseudo-science rather than a legitimate scientific speculation."" But 63 percent of Protestant doctors said intelligent design is a ""legitimate scientific speculation.""

&gt;The study was conducted by the Louis Finkelstein Institute for Social and Religious Research at The Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City and HCD Research in Flemington, N.J.

This is evidence one can be very good a the discipline of medicine while believing in ID or at least the possibility of ID.  This shows that rejection of evolution really isn't much  of a detriment to learning science except for the fact that Darwinists may make it hard for IDists to graduate or enter schools.  

Given that we need more scientists, doctors, engineers in the world, we should NOT be discriminating against individuals because they reject a theory (evolutionary theory) that is pretty much irrelevant scientifically as far as operational science.   

I mean, if we assume God made chimps similar to humans so that we could understand ourselves, that's just as good, from a medical standpoint, as assuming the similarity was by common descent.  In fact, I'm working on a project that may show the assumption of common design might be more advantageous than the assumption of common descent when choosing what model organism to study when trying to elucidate human developmental pathways, pharmaceutical testing, and protein 3D architecture....

The more I thought on the similarity of humans to chimps and rats, I realized what a blessing it is humans aren't subject to all the sorts of cruelties we inflict on lab rats like crushing and mutilating their genitals so we can understand the reproductive process better. I mean we learned about the Hox clusters in fruitflies by mutating and re-engineering them. In the process of studying the Hox clusters, we got fruitflies that grew legs on their heads.  YIKES!  I'm so glad we didn't do these experiments on humans!!!! Get my drift?  

The nested hierarchy of similarity of life forms is God's gift to scientific discovery, it is not the product of common descent, but rather common design as a gift of God to science.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9f66mn/discuss_evolution_discord_server/

Since I wanted some batting practice in defending the creation model and for testing out some of of my teaching materials, I chose to engage the most closed-minded crowd I could find.  They didn't understand much about chemistry or physics or much of anything in science.  One of my opponents OddJackdaw, imho, was very honest to say of himself after I chided him for his lack of science knowledge, ""I already said I am not that smart.""

To get a feel for how the exchange went, I first posted in the ""thunderdome"" section of the server this comment:
&gt;There are chemically expected outcomes.    Life from non-life is not the natural expected outcome of random chemical soups.  Evolutionists say evolution doesn't explain the origin of life.  But neither does chemistry.  In fact chemical theories argue against life being the ordinary expectation of life coming from non-life.

After some back and forth, Cubist eventually responded to me:
&gt;fuck off with your disingenuous hypothetical, Lying Sack Of Shit For Christ
do you honestly not grok that ""I don't know—therefore, I do know. and what I know is…"" is a really shitty argument?

That was my entertainment for the day! So what set him off?

I asserted that evidence that suggests something cannot evolve from a common ancestor, like say the common ancestor of a giraffe and tree (whatever that would look like!), is evidence in favor of creation.  If the fossil record were shown to be young, or if the Earth were shown scientifically to be young, or if abiogenesis is shown to be absurd, etc. -- I asserted this is evidence in favor of creation. 

I said that evidence against abiogenesis and evolution is evidence in favor of creation, but in contrast they all universally disagreed and said evidence against abiogenesis and evolution is NOT evidence in favor of creation.

They demanded I present positive evidence.  So I asked the question, ""so what would count as positive evidence?""  They punted when I asked the question.

I asked something to the effect, ""what would count as evidence even in principle?  Would God appearing to you and telling you He is the Creator count as positive evidence?""  Certainly there are accounts of God appearing to people in the Bible or working miracles before peoples eyes. Such an event converted Paul on the Road to Damascus, for example.  

The reason I raised that hypothetical scenario is to show a paradox.  For them to accept God as Creator, they might need a God-of-the-Gaps miracle to persuade them there is a Miracle Maker.  They could appeal endlessly to some possible undiscovered entity or ""natural explanation"" to explain the miracle, but the problem for them is that if the miracle was actually REAL, their policy of appealing to some ""undiscovered natural mechanism"" would prevent them from ascenting to the truth.  When they appeal to some ""undiscovered natural mechanism"", I take that to mean some Godless process no matter how absurd in terms of physics and chemistry.   FWIW, Dawkins if he saw God in the skies he would think he was hallucinating or that it was the result of Alien technology, but not God.

The problem of appealing to some yet-to-be-discovered explanation has relation to problems in math where Godel proved that there are truths that are formally unprovable but must be accepted on faith.  So yes, hypothetically maybe there is some Godless explanation for the origin of life, but neither side could make a formal proof, only arguments about what is consistent with ordinary chemical and physical processes (aka expected outcomes).

I pointed out to OddJackdaw that his claims that abiogenesis and evolution are true are not based on direct observation, on validated chemical scenarios, but on FAITH acceptance in something unknown, unproven, unseen, likely unknowable, and inconsistent with known laws of physics and chemistry!  I guess he didn't get the hint that I was essentially painting him as a TRUE BELEIVER in something unknown, indescribable, but with incredible creative powers that couldn't be reduced to known laws of physics and chemistry -- uh, so how different is that from believing in some sort of god? That somewhat akin to Pantheism.  His main reason for his beliefs is that God hasn't done anything to presuade him yet, and if God is God, He would know what to do to persuade him.  

I responded by saying, yes indeed, we cannot know the truth without God's help, and that OddJackdaw is essentially admitting he doesn't have the ability in and of himself to know the answer to ultimate questions! The point I was indirectly making was that since he like are mortals are so limited in their ability to formally decide on ultimate questions, he's surely in no position to judge whether I'm right or wrong.  Every person must decide for themselves, and in the final day, I believe it will be known who believed in the truth vs. those who believed in a falsehood.


It's worth pointing out naturalism and rejection of God isn't the same as scientific theories.  A scientific theory is something like the theories of geometric opitics.  If you build glass lens a certain way, it will bend or magnify do what ever according to laws of geometric optics.  That is science.  Contrast this to theories of evolution and abiogensis which claim, ""it happened, but we don't know how, but science has figured lots of things out, so there is probably a natural (ahem, Godless), explanation.""  That is not science, that is naturalism.

In contrast, I pointed out that the laws of Quantum Mechanics, whom some physicists will argue is the most fundamental law, point to the existence of God. To which he responded, ""lol.""  I have a physics degree, he doesn't.  He was laughing at science disciplines he has little interest in studying.

He was more interested in saying my epistemology was flawed than examining the physical and chemical principles against abiogenesis and evolution.

He and his comrades insisted, evidence against evolution and abiogenesis aren't evidence in favor of creation.  When I pressed him and his comrades for ""what would count as evidence in principle as evidence for a Creator""  he essentially punted and said, ""we can't know in advance what would count as evidence of a creator.""

Now, to be fair, my characterization of what he said is paraphrased.  If you want to ask him yourself what he actually said and believes, I should give him the opportunity to speak for himself. So you can talk to him here.  If you do, you have to do it in the ""thunderdome"" section, otherwise he threatens to ban you if you discuss it in the ""general"" section.

Some manufacturers genetically engineer yeast or bacteria with human DNA and then the yeast or bacteria manufacture the insulin and then Pharma companies harvest the human insulin from these microbes.  Alternatively insulin from pigs or cows has occasionally been harvested to give to humans since pig and cow insulin is very similar to human insulin.

Why is that significant?  We can't just take beakers of chemicals and mix them and then out pops insulin!  To make insulin, one needs a machine that reads a blueprint of the complex insulin molecule and then manufactures the insulin molecule according to that blue print.  The name of that machine is a living cell, and the blue print is DNA.

Making insulin is not a matter of taking 20 standard amino acids and putting them in a beaker and expecting the 20 amino acids to assemble spontaneously through condensation reactions into a functional insulin protein!  That would be like taking scrabble letters and trying to make a password to unlock people's bank accounts!  The insulin molecule must be spelled in a very specific way, and cells have the machinery to take a DNA blueprint and spell out the amino acid letters from that blueprint. 

We humans do not have the know-how to make such a machine from total scratch but must take what God has made and then tweak it to our own ends.

Here by the way is the spelling of a ""canonical"" insulin sequence in humans where the letters stand for the individual amino acids:

&gt;SLYQLENYCN     

It may look like gibberish to the ordinary person, but insulin is like a password that signals to receptors on the cell that trigger behaviors in the cell to increase absorption of carbohydrates.

Hopefully this essay gives an intuitive feel of why it is ridiculous to think a pool of chemicals will spontaneously assemble into something living any more than putting a frog into a blender and expecting a new life form to spontaneously emerge from the remains of that poor frog.",16,1536626560,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9ess26/difficulty_of_making_proteins_outside_a_living/

Now, given what we know of physics and chemistry, the feeding of the 5000 was indeed a miracle that requires the power of God.  We tend to trivialize such miracles since we are able to farm fish and grow bread, but to do this from nothing is another story!

Specially creating matter requires energy, in fact the energy to create new matter in a few baskets of fish would be several hydrogen bombs worth of energy.  We know this from Einstein's famous equation.

Added to that, fish have anatomy and biochemistry.  Did Jesus specially create the bio chemical molecules in the fish and arrange them in anatomically correct ways to make a fish.

So, if one accepts the Gospels and this account as literal then one accepts that God can create matter or transform matter miraculously (like turning water to wine).

So when I meet Christian Darwinist, I would confront them with how they interpret these miracles.  Then I would ask, ""If you believe God can create from nothing, outside of discussions of interpreting Genesis, what would convince you that a comparable miracle of special was needed to create life?""

When I was a Christian Darwinist once upon a time, I thought on this and concluded things simply do not evolve the way Darwinists claim.  I don't think it is reasonable for a tree and a giraffe to have a common ancestor.  I don't think a eukaryote and prokaryote have a common ancestor.  The most reasonable answer is that a miracle was needed to make them.   So, each person decides at what point is a miracle the best answer.

Now, I went through a phase I doubted the Gospels altogether and doubted the accounts of the miracles.  But then I was still confronted with whether a miracle was the best answer for the life we have around us.  The more I studied the question the more I became convinced that a miracle is the best answer for the existence of life.  While I had bouts of agnosticism after nearly leaving the faith, it was the scientific evidence of a miracle that persuaded me life was created rather than evolved.  If life was created, there must be a Creator.  It was that simple.  From that point on, I began to have faith in God again.",11,1536353209,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9dye28/miracles_of_special_creation_in_the_new_testament/
Creation,9dv1p5,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,t2_79d54,self.Creation,,What should students of creation and ID study in biology? Can you study the first book of 1 Chronicles in the Bible?,"I've tutored students for several years in topics like Chemistry and Physics and Math, occasionally I get asked what they should study.  I almost always said in effect, ""become as computer literate as possible!""    To that, I would now add, develop social and interpersonal skills.

&amp;#x200B;

But as far as ID goes, I would emphasize biochemistry.  Learning biochemistry is like reading the book 1 Chronicles in the Bible, it has enormously long lists of names connected to other names.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, if you try to study biochemistry in University, they will require you to study 2 semesters of General Chemistry, then 1 or 2  semesters of Organic Chemistry.  This is due to long standing college tradition of WEEDING out pre-med students, not really teaching biochem essentials!   

&amp;#x200B;

 FWIW, I never studied ORGANIC chemistry formally, but I aced graduate level BIO chemistry classes.  Why?  A lot of BIO chemsitry reads like the book of 1 Chronicles, and learning is mostly knowing the names of the molecules and which molecules they connect to.  Some of the Old-School biochem professors will just have you do rote memorization like:     
""memorize the names and abbreviations, symbols, and molecular diagrams of all 20 canonical amino acids.""

&amp;#x200B;

 Ok, so maybe I'm slow but it took me 15 hours to memorize all the diagrams like this one out of Lehninger Principles (the standard biochem textbook):

&amp;#x200B;

[https://thebiochemeffect.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aminoacids-r-groups.jpg](https://thebiochemeffect.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aminoacids-r-groups.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I would just try to list all the amino acids, and then draw them from memory.  I eventually, after about 15 hours, was able to reproduce the above chart from memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you don't necessarily need to go that far, but that the sort of slow tedious learning that you have to go through if you studied biochem in University (depending on your professor).   It is not intellectually difficult as much as intellectually TEDIOUS!    

&amp;#x200B;

Little 4-year old kids can learn the alpha bet of DNAs and amino acids.  I taught my nephew say, ""Adenine, Cyosine, Guanine, Thymine.....now I know my ABC, next time won't you sing with me.""    

&amp;#x200B;

""Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymime"" are the ACGT or the ABCs of the DNA alphabet.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, if not the University, what is the  shortcut?  If you're only willing to spend 15 hours of your life studying biology what would I suggest?  How about 1 or 2 hours of your life?  This is what I would recommend.  Watch the following video over and over.  Seriously, you will learn more biology in this 2-minute video than you'll learn by wasting months studying evolutionary biology.   

r/https://youtu.be/TEQMeP9GG6M

&amp;#x200B;

First just watch the video and sort of understand things like legos.  Just act like you're a kid learning the names of lego parts.

&amp;#x200B;

So note the names and terms:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

nucleus

Helicase

single stranded DNA

5' end

3' end

DNA polymerase 3

DNA polymerase 1

DNA ligase

leading strand

lagging strand

Okazaki fragments

RNA primase

&amp;#x200B;

The way you learn is really just knowing the names of the parts and what parts connect to other parts.  It's mostly tedious, it's not much different that putting names on lego parts and then saying what part connects to what other part.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this important to ID?  The problem is many life-critical biochemical systems cannot evolve if parts are missing since the organism would be dead.   Evolutionists would much rather have you debate Chromosome 2 fusion, Sarcopterygiian evolution (and other Baloney Sandwich BS), than the details of the 2-minute video I would recommend studying.

Creation,9dm95e,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,"Hubble, Hawking, and the Burden of Proof","  

I have made a post about this subject before, but I did not bring in the idea of the burden of proof. I’m posting this to get critiques of the argument.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of the burden of proof applies in situations where there are justifiable default or initial beliefs one should have as answers to questions. For instance, in answer to the question “Is person X guilty of crime Y?” the justifiable default answer is “No,” since we all begin life innocent of any crime. We should not abandon that default belief about person X without specific reasons; therefore, those who claim that person X is guilty must prove their claim. The burden of proof is on them. Another example is the answer to the question, “Is my memory of a life longer than the past five minutes a record of my true history?” The justifiable default answer to this question is “Yes.” We should not abandon the default belief that we are older than the five minutes without specific proof to the contrary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edwin Hubble, upon observing that the surrounding galaxies were moving away from us in every direction, concluded that we are at the center of the observable universe. Of course, when I say that he concluded this, I do not mean that he *accepted* this conclusion, only that this was his initial conclusion. It terrified him, propelling him to propose an alternative that would allow him, as he writes, “**to escape the horror** of a unique position.” Decades later, Stephen Hawking also describes this geocentric conclusion as the initial conclusion justified by observation: “Now **at first sight**,” he writes, “all this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe.” 

Of course, Hawking also rejects this initial conclusion in favor of the alternative: the admirably creative but counter-intuitive idea that there is no center.

So where does the burden of proof lie here? It lies with those who advocate the alternative view, the counter-intuitive view that is not suggested “at first sight.” The simple initial conclusion that we are at the center of the universe is not necessarily the correct one, but any advocate for the alternative must take up the burden of proof and demonstrate that the alternative explanation is better, more justified. 

Does Hubble do this? No.  As far as I can tell, he does not even try. He does not even *pretend* to try. He calls the principle on which his alternative explanation rests “sheer assumption,” and he admits that the hypothesis that we are at the center of the universe “cannot be disproved….” In other words, he admits that the burden of proof cannot be shifted. Hawking agrees, saying “**We have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption \[the assumption that the universe has no center\].”** What Hubble does is *imagine* a coherent scenario in which the universe might have no center, but this is not shifting the burden of proof any more than imagining how someone *might* be guilty of a crime is the same as proving that he *is* guilty the crime. I can *imagine* a scenario in which all my memories beyond five minutes ago have been planted in my brain and do not reflect my true history. Does the fact that I can imagine such a scenario justify believing it?  Of course not.

So what do we have, at the end of the day? We have a justifiable initial explanation of observable facts: We are at the center of the universe. And we have an admission from those who propose the alternative that we are unable to shift the burden of proof required to justify belief in the alternative. Their motives for accepting the alternative explanation in spite of this are simply horror of the first explanation (on the part of Hubble) and sheer refusal to believe its implications on the part of Hawking. As Hawking notes, “We believe it \[the alternative view\] on the grounds of modesty. It would be most remarkable if the universe looked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe!” 

It is remarkable, indeed, and for that reason we should all know about it. In fact, since there are no scientific grounds for thinking otherwise, the geocentric conclusion should, by default, be taught in schools so that each individual has a chance to come to grips with its potential implications about special creation.",57,1536262966,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9dm95e/hubble_hawking_and_the_burden_of_proof/

## &gt;More and more people in Europe are beginning to believe that a god -- not evolution -- shaped life on Earth and there are no signs this development will stop.

\&gt; Creationism, the belief that a god -- not evolution -- shaped life on Earth, is by no means restricted to people from the Bible belt in the US or illiterates in remote corners of civilisation.

\&gt;Not at all, in fact it’s spreading in the very stronghold of evolution, Europe. That’s the conclusion of five years of research that’s been put into new book on creationism. The book details how creationism is on the march throughout most of Europe.

\&gt;Creationism has particularly been on the rise in step with the internet, which according to Peter Kjærgaard has made it much easier for people to become activists and hurl out statements in favour of creationism which look as though they carry just as much weight as scientific results.

\&gt;The scientists' 296-page book 'Creationism in Europe"" has just been published by Johns Hopkins University Press.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Several teachers who spoke to Channel 10 said the Education Ministry prefers they teach as little about evolution as possible. The educators said they received no training on the topic and received hints from the ministry that it was better to focus on other subjects. 

\&gt; Biology classes in kindergarten and elementary school do not mention Charles Darwin’s theory that all life evolved from common ancestors, and in middle school it is only alluded to as part of general discussions, the TV report said.

\&gt;Four years ago, the high school curriculum was revised, the report said. Previously there had been one unit on evolution in the matriculation exams. In the new curriculum, the religiously sensitive theory of common descent has been omitted, and replaced with classes on species survival and genetic modifications and adaptations based on environmental factors.

\&gt; A 2016 Pew Report found that [just over half of Israeli Jews believe in evolution](https://www.timesofisrael.com/evolution-a-hard-sell-among-israeli-jews-pew-study-finds/) (53%), but huge disparities were found between religious groups on the subject. Just 3% of ultra-Orthodox Jews, 11% of Modern Orthodox, and 35% of traditional Jews believe in evolution. Among the secular, 83% believe humans and other living things have evolved over time, and those with a university education subscribed to the belief more readily – 72%– than those that didn’t – 50%. Some 80% of Russian-speaking Jews believe in evolution. ",3,1535749785,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9bxgc4/israel_yet_another_technologically_advanced/
Creation,9bueeb,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.Creation,,Another example of the bias against creation science...,"I remember being absolutely amazed when I first learned that deep sea fossils are on top of Mount Everest and the highest places of every continent on earth. Naturally, the explanation that occurred to me first was Noah’s Flood. It is, after all, the sort of thing one might expect if a world-wide flood really occurred. Of course, there is an alternative explanation, but then there is always an alternative explanation. The alternative explanation is that the sea floor has risen to these heights over millions of years as a result of plate tectonics and uplift.  

I’m not a geologist, so I cannot judge whether one explanation is better than the other from a scientific perspective. What I can do, however, is demonstrate that geologists, as a community, are unable to make that judgment either, though for a different reason. What is the reason? Because the great majority of them are so closed to the possibility of Noah’s Flood that they cannot objectively assess the case for it.

[For example, consider the story of Harlen Bretz](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/channeled-scablands/), a maverick geologist who attempted to explain the landscape of the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington as the effect of a massive flood. Below are some excepts from the National Geographic article I linked.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*And after two seasons in the field, his conclusions shocked even himself: The only possible explanation for the all the region’s features was a massive flood, perhaps the largest in the Earth’s history. “All other hypotheses meet fatal objections,” he wrote  in a 1923 paper…*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*It was geological heresy. For almost a century, ever since Charles Lyell’s 1830 text* [*Principles of Geology*](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Geology-Penguin-Classics-Charles/dp/014043528X) *set the standards for  the field, it had been assumed that geological change was gradual and uniform—always the product of, as Lyell put it, “causes now in operation.” And floods of quasi-Biblical proportions certainly did not meet that standard. It didn’t matter how meticulous Bretz’s research was, or how sound his reasoning might be; he seemed to be advocating a return to geology’s dark ages, when “scientists” used catastrophic explanations for the Earth’s features to buttress theological presumptions about the age of a Creator’s divine handiwork. It was unacceptable. How did canyons and cataracts form? By rivers, of course, over millions of years. Not gigantic floods. Period.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*…\[H\]is audience—none of whom had visited, much less studied, the scablands—was having none of it. Bretz’s hypothesis was not just “wholly inadequate,” in the words of one critic, but “preposterous” and “incompetent.”*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*For more than a decade afterward, Bretz was on the losing side of a pre-ordained conclusion, as the other geologists who*    
*began studying the area concocted one labored hypothesis after another for how the scablands’ features might have been created by gradual erosion.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*Of course, for some of Bretz’s most stubborn critics, even eyewitness experience wasn’t enough. Bretz’s arch-adversary, Richard Foster Flint, a Yale geologist who remained a premier authority in the field until the 1970s, spent years studying the scablands and resisted Bretz’s theory until he was virtually the only one left who did.* 

What can one reasonably infer from this? 

First, that geologists, as a community, reject Noah’s Flood as an explanation even before they investigate the evidence. Noah’s Flood is considered false *a priori*. 

Second, even after assessing the evidence, the majority of geologists would rather accept any number of inferior and tortured explanations for a geological phenomenon rather than accepting an explanation that *even resembles* Noah’s Flood. 

Third, they would accept an explanation that resembles Noah’s flood only as a last resort, *when no other plausible explanations exist*, when it would be embarrassing *not* to accept the megaflood hypothesis. So long, however, as something better than an outright, unsupportable embarrassment exists as an alternative to Noah’s Flood, they will go with that.

As far as I know, Bretz was not a creationist, nor was he trying to make an argument for Noah’s Flood. His great misfortune was that he was trying to make an argument for something that was too much *like* Noah’s Flood. Now imagine the difficulty of making a case for Noah’s Flood as such. 

And skeptics wonder why creationist scientists complain about a bias against their work. ",75,1535728141,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9bueeb/another_example_of_the_bias_against_creation/

Furthermore, I found that this paper has been cited in three other peer-reviewed works by different authors, and by Sanford in another peer-reviewed paper in a different journal (four citations total). Of these papers, all but one I was able to confirm cited the paper without any critical remarks.

I joined this Sub because I believed it was a great Biblical Sub for defending the Word of God through Biblical study and Apologetics....I couldn't be more wrong.

This Sub has nearly gone the same way as /r/Christianity, full of Biblical schism and denying of Biblical authority and truth. Atheists and ""*Christian*"" Evolutionists thrive here and rule the posting and comments. You can't hardly post anything or comment without a barrage of hate, downvoting to oblivion, or flooding of evolutionary bias. 

They will automatically say ""*well this place is for discussion of such topics, and if you can't handle opposing arguments maybe you should leave or study more*"" or something like that. Well yes, a place of discussion, not complete utter flooding, downvoting destruction, and absolute control to remove anything you don't like. Abusing the downvote and knee-jerk complaint arguments isn't discussion. You're just trying to turn this sub into another /r/atheism or /r/Christianity where anyone who actually believes the Bible as absolute Truth is not welcome. 

*This is no longer an actual Biblical Apologetics sub. It's another multi-opinionated religious quasi-Christian Sub.*

Scripture is not open to interpretation, it is not up to whatever you think or feel - **2 Peter 1:20-21** - it is the absolute authority of Almighty God, breathed by God, and preserved by God - ""*I will preserve my Word unto all generations*"" - saying that it is corrupted or incomplete is calling God a liar. Denying the Creation account is calling God a liar. Saying it's open to interpretation is calling God a liar. 

But people will fight against the Truth because they know it is the Truth, and it speaks against their assertions and sin, so they change the Truth into a lie and create gods after their own wicked imaginations - **Romans 1:18-25**

Biblical denying and destruction of absolute doctrine is the common attack method of the liberal evolutionary ""*christian*"" and atheists. They flood the Subs and drive out all truth to silence the authority of the Word of God in an attempt to validate and justify personal opinions and ideology. To open the Scriptures to whatever you wan't, so only 1 way, 1 truth, 1 life doesn't exist - ""*yea, hath God truly said?*""

The Word of God is absolute literal, God spoke and created all things, and Atheistic Evolution is a lie of the Devil and is not supported by Scripture in the slightest.

I'm unsubscribing from this Sub and I'm spreading the word against this Sub. This is become a near cesspit of heresy, unbiblical teaching, denying of Biblical authority, and hyper concentration of personal opinion against absolute authority of Scripture.

Creation,97s01k,nomenmeum,,,self.Creation,,Just a thought about ID theory and the book of Judges...,"Gideon was uncertain about fighting the Midianites.  As a consequence, he said to God: *“If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised—  look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.”*


The normal actions of the forces of nature would put dew on the ground and the wool fleece, so Gideon looks for an outcome that will stand out against the backdrop of the normal actions of the forces of nature, one which will signal a purposeful and intentional action on the part of God.  He gets it.


But psychologically, he needs more, so he asks for another signal that will stand out against the backdrop of the normal actions of the forces of nature: *“Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”*

Again the signal of intelligent, purposeful action producing an effect that the normal actions of nature do not produce.


Gideon’s response is crucial.  He accepts the signal for what it is.

Notice that he does not explain the circumstance away by citing the Multiverse Theory and saying to himself, “You know, if there is an infinite number of universes, this has to happen in one of them.  I guess I just happen to live in that one.”

Of course, he doesn’t say that.  That would be ridiculous.

Creation,97q8nj,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,,self.Creation,,"Promiscuous Domains Argue For Common Design, not Common Descent (Sal's Module/Lego Hypothesis)","\[**Advanced Topic In Molecular and Structural Biology**\]

A protein domain is part of a protein that is analogous to a module or ""lego"" piece in a toy structure.  Figuratively speaking, many human proteins are made of these ""lego"" parts.  These  lego pieces can be assembled in different combinations to make different proteins. 

For example there is something known as the Zinc Finger domain which is found in many proteins, in fact is found in 3% of human proteins!    Learn about Zinc Fingers right here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc\_finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_finger)

Now Look for the green little ""zf"" lego in the pages provided in this link.  There are about 55 pages of proteins with the zf-C2H2 zinc finger.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexington.cgi?cmd=cdd&amp;uid=306579](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexington.cgi?cmd=cdd&amp;uid=306579)

You'll see the zinc finger (the little green ""zf"" lego) is located in all sorts of locations on various proteins.  How did that lego piece arrive in so many different proteins?  Do the hierarchical arrangement of zinc fingers sequences follow the hierarchical arrangement of the proteins they are found in? I doubt it.  If the hierachies don't agree, then for common descent to remain viable, it has to invoke miracles.  But if one invokes miracles, one is pretty much a creationist anyway.

How can random mutation evolve those little ""zf"" legos in so many different proteins and on different places on the proteins in functionally coherent ways?  Gene fusion?  Ha!  Exon shuffling?  Ha!   Some sort of mix and match gene duplication where we take a pice of gene here and join it to another gene there?  Ha!  

It's not trivial to shuffle an exon containing  zinc finger dna randomly into another gene and expect functional coherence, nor is it trivial to set up the machinery to fold proteins with zinc fingers and ensure that little zinc ion is connected to 4 specific amino acids in 3 dimensional space as shown here:

[http://www.med.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/phrmch1/lcn/files/C2H2zincfinger.jpg](http://www.med.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/phrmch1/lcn/files/C2H2zincfinger.jpg)

One might say the zinc finger is kind of promiscuous since it appears in so many proteins.  In fact, promiscuous domains are a problem for evolution:

&gt;\&gt; **The evolution of domain promiscuity is still an open problem**, mostly due to the lack of sequenced ancestral genomes

[https://youtu.be/VvX5yQloHrg](https://youtu.be/VvX5yQloHrg)

Joel Tay ends his talk with a quote by Jesus:

Well, to be frank when I nearly left the Christian faith 17 years ago, I lost faith in the Bible because what Jesus said about creation seemed unbelievable to me!  But Jesus gives a remedy if you don't believe his words, you can start by believe his miraculous works!

\&gt;""believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done, even if you don't believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.""  John 10:38

So as I was about to leave the Christian faith, I gave one last effort to ponder it starting not with the Bible but with the question of creation vs. evolution.  In the process I realized the idea that of  Jesus Christ, the Intelligent Designer and Creator, creating life through a miracle and then destroying much of it in a global flood was a far better explanation for the world we see than evolutionary theory.

I came upon a  part that talked about how the flippers of humpback whales have  developed a design that makes the flippers much more efficient at  steering the whale than would guess.  I found this online talking about  the same topic:  [https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201306/flipper-of-humpback-whale/](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201306/flipper-of-humpback-whale/)

Today I did a Google search, hoping to find a list of a whole bunch  of different design aspects of life on Earth that similarly utilize  principles of physics and such in unexpected ways.  I know I've heard of  others in the past, but can't think of them myself.  For examples, it  seems like in years past I've heard some interesting things about  neurochemistry, biolectricity, cell signaling and such that point toward  intelligent design rather than evolution.

Basically what I'm trying to find is a list of design features of the  human body or other life on Earth that make use of specific physical  principles of science in such a way that would pretty much impossible.   I'm still probably not making sense . . .

What I'm looking for are design features that could NOT have come  into existence incrementally, but rather features that would almost  certainly require a great leap in design, typically combining two  completely different design features that you would never intuitively  have expected to go together.

For example, a design feature that could theoretically have evolved  on its own is the size of the human brain.  Perhaps the first, simplest  brains in history consisted of say 10 cells, but those few cells were in  high demand and got used very frequently, so after a few generations  that creature evolved to have 20 cells, and then 50, and then 1,000,  then millions, then billions.  Through many small mutations, we might be  able to believe that many different features in the human body and  other forms of life evolved on their own.

What I'm looking for though are highly coincidental design features,  synergistic design features, and other design features that just should  almost certainly have never evolved, not unless there was some intelligent being behind the scenes bringing completely new features in.   An example would be the brain going from one single cohesive whole, to  instead splitting into the completely discrete right side and left  side.  Or dinosaurs going from having only scales to starting to have  feathers, and then somehow figuring out how to fly all on their own.   Even the fact that animal's bodies have lots of highly specialized  organs seems unlikely--developing a discrete heart, lungs, gall bladder,  kidneys, brain, etc, not to mention figuring out how to utilize the  cocktail of different chemicals our bodies are full of.

I'm hopeful that this makes sense--basically evolutionary leaps that  would almost certainly require that some intelligent being created us  already understood specific scientific principles, and implemented  features that took advantage of those principles.

If anyone knows of a list of such advanced design features, or can  think of specific examples of such things, preferably with online  sources to link to, I hope you'll reply here.  Perhaps this thread could  even become a running list of such things if there isn't one out there.",120,1533274945,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/946z8p/physical_principles_that_advanced_organisms/

For those of you who wanted to attend the International Conference on Creationism in Pittsburg July 29-Aug 1, 2018, but can't, you can access the papers the presentations are based on for FREE online.  I just learned this today.  Unfortunately the live presentations you have to be present for or pay for. Sorry....

Be warned, the papers are technically challenging to read.  I could hardly understand the geology stuff with all it's terms.  Even some of the physics stuff was challenging.  The papers are written by PhD professors at Christian colleges or professors expelled from secular academia or professors in secular colleges in disciplines where they can't be expelled. So yeah, they write like professors as if publishing in a scientific conference, which means the stuff is barely readable to the lay audience!

For example, here is one by Rob Carter, Stephen Lee, and John Sanford on Adam and Eve:

Most evolutionary stories as to how such features could evolve are just plain silly and unscientific.  Since some people think miracles are outside the realm of science they invoke evolutionary theory, but the problem is, to make evolutionary theory work, evolutionists UNWITTINGLY invoke miracles to rescue their theory.  The problem of butterfly metamorphosis is one such area where miracles are needed to rescue evolutionary theory.

Darwinists don't seem to understand, selection in favor of a trait in the present is evidence of selection against evolving that trait (before it formed) in the past.    What do I mean? When the caterpillar goes into a cocoon, it's body parts totally turn into something like goo.  Ok, so how does the ""goo"" stage (chyrsalis stage) evolve in the first place since it is like dying.  I mean think of your teeth when you grow up.  They fall out.  How did the falling out of teeth get programmed in unless you had teeth to replace them.   I mean there are some really basic questions evolutionists don't think through carefully.

Creation,92kjcy,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,,self.Creation,,Common Descent vs. The Hackability Hypothesis,"Creationists are confronted with the very legitimate question:  ""Why did God create chimps to be so similar to humans if he wanted us to believe in creation? The existence of a chimp sort of makes me think we might have evolved?""  Indeed, that was my feeling once upon a time when I was an evolutionist.

The usual response by creationists, which I deem to be lame (even though I'm a creationist myself), is ""We humans are not that similar to chimps!""     The problem with that response is that it is obvious we are way more similar to chimps than we are to trees.  Our proteins share a lot of similarity with chimps.  If you doubt me, we can spend a few hours in front of gene and protein browsers and I'll show you.  I would even suggest we do indeed, despite the protests of most creationists, have shared errors with chimps.   When God cursed Adam and Eve, he probably cursed the animals in similar ways.  For example, mammals have cancer and juvenille diabetes.  So why should creationist dispute shared errors????  ""Absence of shared errors""  is not exactly what the bible teaches, in fact, the Bible may suggest the opposite.  I see some evidence of shared errors  or the potential for shared errors when I browse through gene sequences, like say the Interferon Lambda 3/4 pseudo genes.  I wish creationists would drop SOME of their arguments against shared errors.  I think God designed life to be blessed, and when Adam sinned, God re-designed life to be cursed, and that entails designed shared errors.

If the fossil record however is young, and life is young, then even evolutionists will concede there is simply not enough time for all the creatures on the Earth to evolve from a common ancestor.  So why did the Intelligent Designer of Life (whom I believe is the Christian God), make chimps?  It would seem making a chimp would be kind of deceptive if He wanted to make people believe in creation rather than evolution.  One ID proponent who goes by the pseudoname ""Mike Gene"" believes in common descent because of that very question, but he still adamantly believes in ID.

So what is my answer to the question of our similarity to chimps?  First off, it seems to me, God does not make it easy for every one to believe the truth.  He normally requires people to seek and ponder the truth rather than making miraculous appearances like he did to the Apostle Paul or the prophet Moses.  ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, the glory of kings is to search out a matter."" Prov 25:2.  People who do not ultimately love truth or who would rather reject God will easily remain in darkness.  2 Thess 2:11-12. 

But is the chimp merely a deceptive tool to make people think we evolve?  Well, if the evidence suggests the fossil record is young, then most certainly another explanation is possible for the similarity of humans to chimps and the supposed progression of life forms from bacteria to fish to mammals to primates (like chimps) to humans.  The answer is ""God did it"", but then the question is ""why?""  The Bible is silent on this as far as I can tell, but let me offer a speculation....

Biology is designed for scientific discovery.   The mysteries of life are, figuratively speaking, hackable (like hackability of a computer).   The patterns of similarity and diversity are designed to help us understand ourselves and our place in the universe.  

If you could see all the cruel things we do to lab rats and mice, you'd appreciate so much more that God gives us model organisms like the mouse that we can mutilate, dissect, mutate, and subject to all manner of cruelty in the lab so that we can understand our own biology.  It is wonderful we can study bacteria and yeast to understand human genes, like say topoisomerase which is very important to developing anti-cancer  drugs.    The patterns of similarity and diversity in biology are highly optimized to help us understand ourselves and the fact we are fearfully and wonderfully made.

Christian theology gives a picture of sacrifice of an innocent lamb to atone for our sins.  In fact, we cannot live in the biological sense unless innocent creatures (be they plants or animals) were sacrificed so that we could live. By way of extension, we cannot even understand ourselves unless innocent creatures (from bacteria to chimps) are sacrificed so that our knowledge could be furthered.  

The progression from simple to complex is very helpful.  We study worms like C. elegans with simple brains because studying something as complex as a human brain in its fullness is sometimes too prohibitive.  The pattern of similarity among biological creatures is a gift from God to man.  Life only looks evolved to those who refuse to see the strong evidence against evolutionary theory such as the age of the fossil record, the orphan genes and features, the lack of viable transitional forms in principle, the waiting time problem, etc. etc.     The patterns of similarity are by design so that we can ""hack"" the codes and mysteries of life.  Hence, I suggest the ""hackability hypothesis.""

So to creationists who are wrestling with ""why did God make chimps so similar to humans?""  I encourage you to think of larger question ""Why did God make us so similar to mammals, and why did God make us have some similarity to bacteria, like the sharing the genetic code?""  

The answers lie in this,  rhetorical queston:  ""what if God didn't make those patterns of similarity and diversity?""   Would we be able to study life so effectively? The answer I think is an emphatic ""No.""  Ergo, God went to great lengths to ensure the scientific enterprise and the study of biology would succeed, he did this by making creatures like chimps.

FWIW, the collective biological knowledge may one day affirm the youth of life and possibly even Noah's flood. This would not have been possible if God didn't make creatures like mammals who have similarity to humans.",6,1532764816,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/92kjcy/common_descent_vs_the_hackability_hypothesis/

Creation,92cq3a,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,,self.Creation,,Why I Don't Trust Geological Stories About the Fossil Record,"Look at this picture of layered  strata

[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/CF1A5C/cliffs-made-of-red-and-white-layered-sedimentary-rock-with-horizontal-CF1A5C.jpg](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/CF1A5C/cliffs-made-of-red-and-white-layered-sedimentary-rock-with-horizontal-CF1A5C.jpg)

The story goes: 

\&gt;""sediments over millions of years accumulated.  First it was one color of sediment, and then abruptly another color of sediment, and then abruptly another color! ""

 Ok, superficially I might have bought that story a long time ago, but as I thought on the basic mechanical problems of how this would have to happen, and when geologists never gave an answer that would make much sense in terms of physics (I have an MS in applied physics), I began to feel like I was being given a sales pitch for a car that didn't work.

Suppose we have a mountain that is one color (dark brown) and it erodes into a valley,  it creates the bottom layer of sediments in the picture.  Ok, so far so good.  But now another mountain of another color (reddish) erodes into the SAME valley while the other mountain for some strange stopped eroding for some reason simultaneously.   Uh, that gets harder to believe.  And then the reddish mountain stops eroding and suddenly the white mount starts eroding simultaneously.  Maybe if this happened in isolation, maybe, but how does this happen over REALLY large geographical areas like say over several American states such as the case in the North America  Permian basin:

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Generalized-geologic-cross-section-of-the-Permian-Basin-along-the-transect-shown-in-Fig\_fig11\_292386282](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Generalized-geologic-cross-section-of-the-Permian-Basin-along-the-transect-shown-in-Fig_fig11_292386282)

Note how ALL the layers that were supposedly formed over millions of years were then suddenly bent out of shape by one event. So let me get this straight, we assume the Earth for millions of years had hardly any geological activity so that the layers can form nicely one on top of the other, somehow without geological activity mountains of different colors for whatever reason switch on and off in an orchestrated manner to give different colored layers. And then one big geological event bends the layers in the North American Permian basin?

Do you believe that or would you prefer an explanation based on simple hydrologic sorting of particles that have been demonstrated over and over and over again in the laboratory and is based on sound physics of moment of inertia and archemedes principle?  Look at this simple experiment (albeit exaggerated):

Creation,907e2w,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,,self.Creation,,"Self-Destructing Designs, Rube Goldberg Machines -- Good or Bad Designs","Darwinists have used the ""bad design"" argument to great effect.  They implicitly leverage the fact of sickness and disease and  dying world as evidence against a wise designer. Since the Designer didn't make us immortal, but rather through the process of death, he made us dispensible, they conclude the Designer must not exist because any competent Designer wouldn't make Designs that self-destruct.  

Well, I would respond, ""Fireworks self destruct, they are quite entertaining to the human designer and the audience the human designer wishes to impress.""  Also, Monsanto invented self-destructing life forms known as terminator and traitor seeds which can grow crops but which are infertile, thus causing farmers to bow down in subjection to Monsanto.  Monsanto used self-destructing designs as way of humbling others and putting them into subjection.  The point is the design is for the benefit of the designER (like say Monsanto, the fireworks maker or  God) not the designEE (the self-destructing seed, the self-destructing firework, the self-destructing human being). 

Now, granted, that doesn't paint a very inviting theological viewpoint regarding humanity's place in reality.  If we are the objects of God's wrath, humans living in a cursed world...that's not a very pleasant thought.  It is, even as Christian creationist, somewhat better to think our world isn't actively cursed by the Designer, rather it is just random nature, because an Designer who has wrath is a disturbing thought.

So what about Rube Goldberg machines?  Are they invented for the benefit of the Rube Goldberg machine or the benefit and amusement of the designer and the designer's audiences?   The problem with Darwinian ""bad design"" arguments is they are framed in terms of human perspectives of what counts as good or bad.  What good does it do for a Rube Goldberg machine to be designed the way it is?  None really, the purpose of the design is not for the benefit of the designEE, but the designER.   

We humans are Rube Goldberg machines.  Michael Behe was the first to suggest that meme, and now it is being used (sometimes as a term of derision) by other biologists including Nobel Prize winner Aziz Sancar.

The point is, it's rather silly to describe the goodness or badness of the design in terms of the benefit conferred to the desginEE.  What benefit is there to the Rube Goldberg machine to be designed the way it is.  The goodness or badness of the design is measured by the designER, not the designEE.  Think about the Rube Goldberg machine in the video below. Is it a good or bad design.  How do you decide if it is good or bad?  This is obviously relevant to the arguments that humans are poorly designed.  We humans are the ultimate in Rube Goldberg machines.

Ok her is a video of  one man-made Rube Goldberg machines:

Dawkins is convinced there is no God because of Darwinian evolution.

He admits, in effect, nothing could convince him in principle God exists.  At least, now he's being a little more honest than he was before.

What he said before was:

\&gt;the presence of a creative deity in the universe is clearly a scientific hypothesis.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more momentous hypothesis in all of science.

Recently he admits changing his tune.  He now says even if he saw God work miracles in front of him, he'd assume he was hallucinating.  Amusingly, the audience is so certain there is no God, they applauded him for saying so.

Elsewhere, Dawkins raises a question about God hiding himself from humans.  I think it actually is a very very good question, and one that isn't adequately addressed in churches.  It's a question that shouldn't be dismissed. It is a question Dawkins hypothetically posed to God.

Somone once asked Dawkins what he would do if he was before God's judgement seat after Dawkins died.  

Dawkins said he would confront God by saying, ""Sir, why did you go to great pains to hide yourself.""  

First, Dawkins admitted even if God made himself apparent to Dawkins, Dawkins would presume he was hallucinating.   Not withstanding that, it is a good question by Dawkins.  Afterall, God appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, why hasn't he done the same for we who seek after God?

Several answers are from Scriptures, some are inspiring, others are disturbing.

""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, it is the glory of kings to search out a matter.""  Prov 25:2

""And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:  that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.""  2 Thes 2:11-12

Dawkins claims his best proof against God is Darwinian evolution which asserts a fish can through ""natural"" selection, after N-generations become a giraffe, a bird, your mommy and daddy, etc..  A six-year old kid overheard me describing evolutionary theory this way to his parents, and he rightly said forcefully, ""that's stupid.""

So here is a hypothetical dialogue based on a real exchange I had with a god-hating Darwinist at TheSkepticalZone.org.

ME: So I ask, ""Ok, for starters so would a miracle in one's personal life convince you there is a God?  Let's say hypothetically you saw the dead raised as described in the Bible.""

Joe Atheistic Darwinist:   ""I would need scientific proof it was a miracle.""

ME:  ""What would count as scientific proof.""

Joe Atheistic Darwinist: ""Repeatable experiments.""

ME:  ""But repeatable experiments imply doing something for you on demand, like flicking on a light switch and seeing the light bulb come on, right?  You believe the light switch works because you can get it to work on demand and understand what makes it work or not work. Right?""

Joe Atheistic Darwinist:  ""Exactly!!!  I want to see we can duplicate raising from the dead, or creating a creature from the dust, or any other miracle pretty much at will.  The way I believe in a light switch is the way I can believe in God.""

ME:  ""So in other words, God has to do things you demand and in the way you specify, otherwise you won't believe in Him.  That sort of seems reasonable since that's the way I've come to believe in the existence of gravity and light switches.  BUT.....

But if God were willing to be called upon to do things at your whim, that wouldn't be much of a God, at best it might be a law of physics, but certainly not anything like a Creator that creates and does miracles for his own good pleasure, not the pleasure and whims of we mere mortals.

 The sort of god that you say will persuade you is real is a god who is at your disposal to do as you say when you want it.  Don't you see there might be a problem in the way you're demanding what would count as evidence for God, a Creator, or creation?  The way you've essentially set up your standards of evidence, you, in effect are defacto god since you would only believe in god if you could dictate to him how he should behave and respond to your every whim of experimental demands.

 If the Christian God is real, by your standards of evidence, even if he does exist, you'll never be able to arrive or believe in his existence.  This is obviously extensible to the question of Creation.

Now one can be an Christian and an evolutionist.   I was, once apon a time. But as a former skilled casino gambler who used math skills to take the casino for a small sum of $30,000,  I think an atheist betting his soul that evolutionary theory is true vs. the life on Earth being young is making a bad bet.  He has to have 100&amp;#37; certainty there is no Creator God whom he will face on judgement day.    But if Noah's flood is real and the fossil record is young, then the Judeo-Christian God has a serious chance of be real.

If hypothetically you had credible evidence the fossil record was young, that life was young, would this give you reasons to believe the Bible was for the most part true?  As I came to accept that the mainstream evolutionary and paleontoligical narrative was an absolute sham after studying the facts, I found it easier to believe the Bible was true.

Even accepting the Earth and Universe are old but that the fossil record is best explained by a global flood rather than millions of years of slow sedimentary accumulation made a difference in my life.

Now if YEC or Noah's flood were purely an academic question with no consequences for our lives, then why invest much time and worry over it?

Sometimes I ponder Creation. 

What was the world like before the fall of man, before the world was corrupted. I read a theory somewhere once. It postulated that before the flood there was no rain, and that the entire planet was surrounded by a body of water (like the ocean as the ozone layerr). The ocean around us made the entire planet like that of a greenhouse. Additionally, it blocked out more of the harmful rays from the sun, allowing everything to live longer, grow bigger.


Maybe after the flood, all the dinosaurs died out at once because their bodies could no longer tolerate the newly increased amount of UV rays. 


Have you ever played with Bey Blades? They're a kids toy, akin to a top. You load it into the launcher, the pull the tab to rapidly spin and release the blade (the top). It spins for a very long time if left undisturbed. 


Sometimes I think of creation as God setting the universe in motion, spinning like a top. As tops spin they lose momentum and balance. The faster a top spins and heavier it is, the longer it will spin. If the universe is like a giant top with everyone spinning inside it, it makes perfect sense that the expanding universe is slowing down, and that everything is slowly dying. 


Maybe days were shorter then too. Who knows? It's something I like to speculate about every now and then. Sometimes it's just nice to wonder.",13,1530992782,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8wvsus/sometimes_i_ponder_creation_i_wanted_to_share_my/

*Hypothetically,*

and 

if the Genesis narrative is historically accurate, 

then (among many other things) the human genome may contain genetic information (from these angelic contributors) that is not in a direct line from Adam and Eve.  

If that is the case,


A) could that throw off estimates of the age of the human genome?

Creation,8tmah1,Gandalf196,,,self.Creation,,Food for thought,"I've recently watched Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odysesey. The guy was a cinema genius, no question about it. He was one of the greatest directors of all time; his movies are timeless masterpieces. The one mentioned in this topic is particularly interesting for this sub, as I am going to expand. Major spoilers ahead!

The Dawn of Man: the audience is presented with a typical evolution textbook scenario, as one would expect, given the subtitle... Apes rummaging through foliage, looking for food, occasionaly falling prey to predators, nothing out of the ordinary. The turning point is heralded by a black rectangular-shaped monolith, which emerges out of thin air. Initially startled by its sudden appearance, the apes' curiosity soon overcome their fear; touching the obelisk becomes commonplace.

The encounter is soon revealed to be pivotal in the ""tape of life"" — a proverbial Dirac delta is set into motion, the stillness of their lives suddenly broken by a major ""Eureka"" event: the previously useless bones of dead animals have a newfound usage as tools.

See, this masterpiece came in 1968, but it could easily pass as a artistical portrayal of Eldrege and Gould's landmark paper, for stasis is the rule; living organisms' features may fluctuate and become slightly different through the course of time, but *something* has to nudge the wheel of life for complexity to increase.

Paved the way for humans to evolve, the monolith would appear two more times in the movie, providing major breakthroughs in each, culminating in something akin to Teilhard's Omega Point.

I feel like there is enough confusion on this topic, people are interested in it, and it's actually something I can help clear up.

Note that I'm trying to approach physics the way a physicist would \-\- leave God out of it. You'll see why we all agree to leave God out of it in the conclusions here.

Note also that we get hung up on terminology. I've avoided using the word ""universe"" because it is so heavily loaded. Instead, I have sets ""A"" and sets ""B"".

I've tried to spell out all of my assumptions and all of the logical conclusions. Feel free to dig down into the logic if you need to. That's the sort of conversation I enjoy immensely.

&gt;Let me try to be perfectly clear and logical.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  set ""A"" is defined to be the set of all things that ever existed, ever  will exist, and that exists now, in material or immaterial form. ""2"" is  in there, along with you and God and everything else.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  set ""B"" is defined to be the set of all things that has matter or  momentum. This is all the stuff that physics talks about, stuff like  light and electrons and cars rolling down hills at a specific angle  \(quick\-calculate the normal force!\)  
&gt;  
&gt;I  assume there are a set of laws that governs A. Those laws may or may not  be finite in number, but they are consistent and describe all possible  behavior of entities in A and interactions among entities in A. We know  some of these laws, such as ""a\+0=a for all a in the set of real  numbers"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of these laws apply to  objects in B, and some do not. \(IE, ""a\+0=a for all a in the set of real  numbers"" doesn't apply because real numbers do not exist in B.\)  
&gt;  
&gt;We think we know a large number of the laws that apply to B, which we call ""Physics"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Two of those laws state:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Total energy is conserved for closed systems.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Entropy increases over time for closed systems.  
&gt;  
&gt;B  is a closed system by definition. There is nothing that the things in B  can interact with physically outside of B, since all physical things  are in B.  
&gt;  
&gt;If B is not an empty set, then either 1 or 2 is violated.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's what I'm saying.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now,  if you were to allow God to create matter or energy, then we have a  problem, since this would violate conservation laws. Conservation laws  are there for a reason: It tells us things won't spontaneously appear  and things won't spontaneously disappear. It says that when we see a  change, we can always track down the source and the destination of that  change. In short, if God is allowed to create new things in B, then 1 is  violated.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand, maybe God  knows how to reverse entropy. If so, then 2 is violated. \(EDIT:  Maxwell's demon shows why a violation of 2 is exactly like a violation  of 1: You can create energy from nothing.\)  
&gt;  
&gt;In either case, we have to break the laws of physics to make B non\-empty.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now,  I'm not going to bet my eternal salvation on the 2 laws of  thermodynamics. I suspect that we're going to find an exception one day,  but here's the thing: To find an exception is to mean that matter and  energy can spontaneously be created or destroyed, and should we find  that exception, it would make us gods, capable of destroying everything  in B or creating an entirely new set of things in B that are completely  unconnected with everything else in B \(pocket universes.\)

Personally, I believe that there is a secret way to violate the second law, probably requiring something that only God has access to. \(It would have to be information of some sort, like a magic spell.\) There is a fantastic short story about this written by Isaac Asimov called ""The Last Question"". Read it, please.

However, as a physics student, I cannot say that this is physically possible, since all evidence \(literally, all of it!\) says it cannot be violated, not even by God. To imagine that God violates these laws is entirely unscientific and unphysical. None of the miracles recorded in the Bible are a clear violation of it either. To allow God to change these laws at his whim is to call into question whether the universe even exists at all, or ever did, or will exist in the next moment, making things entirely contingent on how God is feeling that day. If God is that sort of being, then for some reason, he is choosing not to exercise such power, and hasn't given us any clues that he can exercise such power, or that he will. If God has a power, but never uses it, how is that different from not having such a power?

Finally: I really think you need to ponder on Descartes line of thinking regarding whether we are living in the Matrix or whether we can find any truth at all. I believe that God has inspired people with correct ideas, but especially, God has inspired us to challenge our prevailing ideas with experiment to discern truth and error. That is the foundation of modern science. If God is hiding from us his magnificent power to suspend the laws of physics \-\- is that simply deception? Or is he trying to tell us a far greater truth that perhaps these 2 laws span into non\-physical realms? I can't tell.

Keep in mind, for my atheist friends, ""God"" is the thing that we credit with creating the universe, so for you, substitute ""Big Bang"" for ""God"" and you'll see why I really don't like Big Bang theory, and why it isn't as popular as you would expect among physicists ""in the know"".",18,1526582922,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8k6p16/laws_of_thermodynamics_and_god/

**The Problem of Origin**

&gt;A key philosophical question related to the problem of creation is “Why should something be created?” or “Why is there something rather than nothing?” Philosophers who ask this question may not necessarily doubt that the world presently exists, although Solipsists during Greek times did question it. They are instead looking for rational grounds for something to be created into this present form of existence. We know that the world around us is changing. Things are created and destroyed. The nations, communities, cultures and organizations to which we presently belong were created at some point in time. Could it be that this gigantic universe was also created at some point in history? If yes, how was the universe created? 
 
&gt;It has been customary to treat the problem of creation as a problem of change taken to its logical extreme. We see that new things are created through a process of material change. The philosopher therefore supposes that there must be some change in the beginning that caused the creation of matter and the universe. But, if the present universe is comprised of everything that exists, then what existed prior to the universe? If the visible universe is everything that exists, then the universe must come from nothing. 

&gt;Greek philosophers were aware of this problem and the ques-tion of origin was debated in this context for nearly two thousand years without much of a useful outcome. In recent times, therefore, the question has changed. Now, we don’t ask “How was matter cre-ated?” We rather ask “What caused the universe to appear in its present form, given that matter in some form already existed?” This approach preempts questions about the origin of matter and focus-es upon giving matter a form—its current form. Matter in this view is eternal and not created. Matter is, however, given a form. The idea that matter is eternal arose along with the development of science when Newton wriggled himself out of nearly two millennia of paralyzing Greek questions concerning the origins of material existence by saying that science should study changes and not existence. Newton’s point was that we cannot debate the origin of matter and energy. We can only speak about the changes to matter and energy given that these already exist in some form in the universe.

&gt;From what we can know from within the universe, questions about changes to form can be tackled better than questions about the origin of matter. And yet, questions about the origins of matter are very tempting for some. Indeed, this is one primary area of methodological and ideological conflict between scientific and religious views of creation. In science, matter and energy are eternal, although they can be interconverted. The appearance of the uni-verse is a transformation of energy, not its creation. Most religionists however think that God created the universe, which involved the creation of matter or energy. They are therefore involved with the question of what precedes matter and causes matter to exist. 

&gt;I will not debate whether matter is eternal or not, because the eternality of matter is assumed in Vedic philosophy. Similar to the scientific view, in the Vedic view matter is transformed from an ‘unmanifest’ or ‘dormant’ stage to a ‘manifest’ or ‘active’ stage. The primary difference between scientific and Vedic ideologies is how this transformation takes place. Scientists today hypothesize that matter acquires a form through a random fluctuation in empty space-time, which is, by itself, originally formless. In other words the creation of form is a chance event. The Vedic view says instead that the forms in matter have an origin in the fundamental capabilities of consciousness to sense, use, know, judge, intend and enjoy. Consciousness embeds its abilities to know and act into matter. The primary difference between these two viewpoints is that consciousness arrives late in the scientific view, after billions of years of matter developing into sophisticated forms, while in the Vedic view consciousness exists from the very beginning and creates forms.

&gt;In modern times, the question about the origin of form has been debated for several decades between design creationists and evolutionists. The design creationist says that the laws of nature hold sway over matter—in exactly the same way that current science has discovered—but the laws of nature allow many phenomena to occur, not all of which are determined by the physical laws of nature. Biological species, specifically, are underdetermined by the laws of physics. For these species to arise in the form that we see them, enormous amounts of information is needed, which cannot be created randomly. This information, the creationist maintains, is an element of design by God . The design takes place within the laws of nature, and overcomes the information gap needed to create complexity. The evolutionist rebuttal to this argument is that our universe is a rare event. It is highly improbable but given enormous universal timescales, anything—even a small probability—becomes reality. A stronger version of the design argument, therefore, sees the hand of God in the laws of nature themselves. Physicists know that the formation of atoms, molecules and other complex structures depends on the values of natural constants. If these constants were even fractionally different than what they are, things that we see in the present universe would not exist. The values of these constants, the design creationist claims, are not random occurrences, but an element of design by God. The materialist rebuttal to this view is that material properties and laws appear through a step-by-step symmetry breaking in a multi-dimensional space. The design creationist however asks how that multi-dimensional space came into being. Such a complex mathematical structure is, after all, not “nothing” and the information needed to create such a mathematical structure had to have had a source. In recent times, this problem has become further compounded by the postulate of multiple universes which differ slightly in terms of natural constants. The values of natural constants, the materialist claims, are an accident of our present universe; in another universe, these values would be different. 

&gt;The debate between creationists and evolutionists rages on because they appear to interpret the same facts—namely, empty space-time, physical laws and natural constants in these laws—in two different ways. The evolutionist says that these facts about nature are a coincidence of time and infinite possibilities allowed by modern mathematical theories, but the creationist claims that they are elements of God’s design. It seems to me that this debate cannot be settled without bringing additional ideas to the question itself.

&gt;The key missing piece in this debate is a lack of clarity in how we conceive information. The manner in which science conceives information is different from how observers perceive it. Science describes object states in relation to other objects while we perceive these states in relation to our minds and senses. For instance, science will measure temperature using a thermometer and produce values such as 50oC while the senses will measure the same temperature and produce types such as hot or cold. The mind and senses attribute to the world semantic information rather than physical states. The fundamental difference between these two notions about information keeps cropping up in all debates about chance and information, but they are never adequately explained. Before we get into the creation-evolution debate, therefore, let us try to define the difference between physical and semantic information. What is semantics and how is it different from the physical states? Semantics can be broken down into at least three distinct ideas. 

&gt;First, it is the ability in matter to hold information about other objects; the human world is characterized by the existence of thinking minds which hold information about the world. But minds are not the only stores of information. Books, paintings, music and sciences, which are descriptions of other things, also store information and our commonsense view says that we can hold information about other things within matter. However, no physical theory supports this idea. In all physical theories, matter provides information about itself, not about other objects. Thus, books, music, and theories of science are meaningless physical entities, to which we attribute meaning. But how can we attribute meanings to things if we are also material? The aboutness of semantic information is one key area of difference between semantic and physical information. 

&gt;Second, the manner in which sciences postulate the existence of reality is different from how we perceive that reality. Science says that reality is mass, charge and frequency, which we perceive as taste, touch and smell. Semantic information pertains to how we perceive the world, which is different from how current science de-scribes reality. Our commonsensical view attributes our perceptions back to reality. For example, if the apple is perceived as red, round and sweet by us, we must be able to talk about the apple in terms of how we perceive it rather than as physical concepts of mass, charge, energy, momentum, etc. which we don’t perceive. In performing physical measurements, what we perceive is detector clicks and pointer movements, which are different from mass, energy or momentum. Every physical concept must be mapped to perceptions for science to be empirical, but the language used to describe matter and perceptions are quite different. Science employs the language of perception while describing our observations, but discards this language during theory formation and reality attribution. Matter, in current science, must be described in terms of its relation to other objects, not in relation to observers. This gap between theory and experiment within science has never been bridged. We see pointer movements and hear detector clicks, but interpret them to be indicators of energy or mass. Mass as a property can be applied back to reality but the sound of the detector click cannot be applied to reality. Every perception is typed, but science converts these types to quantities. For example, a sound may be loud or soft; they are two different types. In science, there is only one type—frequency—which has two different values that correspond to our perception of loud and soft. The gap between physical and semantic information is whether we describe nature in terms of types or quantities. 

&gt;Third, science studies the properties of individual material objects but the everyday world attributes new properties to collections of such objects which can’t always be reduced to the parts themselves. For instance, a plank of wood becomes a leg only when it is part of the chair, but not when outside of it. Biologists habitually describe the living body in terms of organs with functions while the materialist sees it as nothing more than atoms, molecules and their states. In the way that a plank of wood is not a leg outside the whole chair, chemicals are not organs outside the whole. While the physical states studied in science are states of the individual objects, the functional concepts we apply to them are properties of the collection of objects. Physical information is always about the individual parts while semantic information is generally about the relation between a part and the whole. Thus, meanings are defined collectively: something is a car only in relation to a driver, a road, a place to go, and the desire to go. Something is food in relation to a stomach, the desire to eat food, and the will to survive and lead a healthy life. Thus far, we know how to measure physical properties of individuals, but we still do not know how to associate these individual physical properties with meanings in the context of whole systems. This is another important area of semantic vs. non-semantic difference.

&gt;Semantics requires information to refer to other objects, to employ types rather than quantities, and to carry meanings which arise in contexts but not in individuals. These are problems not of religion, but of how matter is described in science. Accordingly, the roots of the debate between materialism and creationism lie in everyday intuitions about how the mind refers to things, cognizes the world in terms of types and sees new properties in collections, while science studies things-in-themselves, describes them in terms of physical quantities, and reduces collections to parts. The apparent conflict between these two descriptions would disappear if nature indeed had referential properties, could be described by types and had new properties that arise in collections. Since all these are within the scope of science, the answer to the question of whether religion has anything to offer to science is positively yes. What religion has to say is that there is another way to describe nature, namely in terms of references, types and collections with which we are familiar from everyday experience, but which does not exist in current science. The formation of theories that describe nature in new ways would not be any less empirical. If these theories make new predictions, beyond the reach of current science, then they would change our view of reality from things to meanings. A meaning can be objectified in matter, but its origin cannot be settled without reference to consciousness. In that specific sense, the origin of the universe requires the existence of consciousness which objectifies its choices as objects, by embedding meanings within matter. 

&gt;**The Physical Basis of Meanings**

&gt;One of the problems in semantics is that concepts by which objects are described individually differ from concepts by which they are described collectively. Material objects acquire new properties when aggregated into collections. These new properties are not just features of the whole system; rather, they are features of the individuals within the whole. Whether or not an object is part of a collection makes a difference to that object. The most important question at this time is: What do we mean by a collection? In current science, matter is situated in space-time, which does not have boundaries. Science loosely uses the concept of a system, which is a bounded area of space-time, but the concept of a boundary does not enter physical theories in any meaningful way. Objects inside and outside the boundary are the same. If there are no boundaries in space, and all matter exists in an infinite expanse of space-time, then how can we speak about systems in physical or even biological sciences?

&gt;This is a new facet about information that has gone unnoticed and undetected in both creationist and evolutionist accounts. Let’s suppose for the moment that there is nothing material about the boundary that divides matter into systems. Let’s say that these boundaries are properties of the observer that divide matter into macroscopic objects. Once matter has been aggregated into collections, each member of the collection has new properties that did not exist prior to the drawing of the imaginary boundary. The ability to draw boundaries in space-time therefore has real physical effects, even though you may not perceive the boundary itself. This basic insight forms the basis of an elaborate theory of mind-body interaction in Vedic philosophy. The mind conveys its choices by drawing boundaries, which creates new properties within matter. The boundary cannot be seen, but we can speak of it objectively.

&gt;In Vedic philosophy, mind and matter interact through the subtle element called Ether. Mind does not control matter directly. Rather, it changes ‘forms’ in Ether, which in turn change properties in matter. One of the fundamental aspects of the mind is that it divides the universe into parts. We commonly encounter this fact in our efforts to know the world where we break complex things down into parts, until we can comprehend the parts. This division of the universe into parts is somewhat arbitrary and governed by our ways of thinking and using the world. There is no reason for me to think that the table in front of me is a unitary object, which I can use for reading and writing, different from the air that surrounds it. For the ant on the table, the table may not be a unitary object and table drawers can be seen as different from the table. For me, the meaning of the drawer is given in relation to the table as a whole. Our ability to attribute concepts to matter depends on our ability to divide matter into macroscopic objects. The parts get their meaning from the nature of the whole, which is also a part within a bigger whole, etc. 

&gt;If the observer’s ability to draw boundaries in space has an effect on reality, then the existence of functional parts and wholes can be attributed to the observer’s ability to draw those boundaries. These boundaries cannot be seen, although their existence has physical and empirical consequences. By drawing boundaries in different ways, matter is aggregated into macroscopic objects in different ways. The properties of the parts are a consequence of how the mind has drawn the boundary. Now, the fact that something is a table leg is not an accident. It is rather the product of drawing a boundary between the table and the rest of the world, and dividing the table functionally into different types of parts. Scientists often describe macroscopic objects as systems, although object boundaries have no role in current scientific theories. By adding the notion of macroscopic boundaries—that exist in space, and yet are invisible to observation—it is possible to bridge the current gap between semantic and non-semantic ideas about matter. Semantic units arise when matter is divided by boundaries and aggregated into wholes. Without boundaries, matter is just non-semantic particles.

&gt;That semantics arises inside closed boundaries is an idea that can be applied to ordinary macroscopic systems and to the universe as a whole—a closed universe must be a semantic system. Like a human body is divided into a set of functions, which make sense collectively within the boundary of the body, Vedic philosophy divides the universe into functional parts. The universe as a whole is thus sometimes compared to a virata-purusha or cosmic person. Although there is no single consciousness that inhabits the cosmos like a soul inhabits the whole body, the cosmos is still treated like a single ‘body’. The notion of a cosmic person is an extension of the idea that every closed system is divided into semantically distinct parts and becomes a functional system because of this division. If the universe is a closed system, then, like every closed system, it must be comprised of functional parts. Parts of the universe will be distinct like the head, throat, heart, stomach, hands and legs in a human body. This functional treatment of the universe hinges on the idea that closed systems are semantic systems, and meanings arise automatically within closed systems. The only assumption we need in order to treat the universe semantically is that the universe is closed.

&gt;The notion of closed systems and the fact that they give rise to semantic properties leads us to a new view of space, different from the one used in current science. In a non-semantic space, a location in space denotes a different object, but not necessarily a different type of object. In classical physics, for instance, all particles are identical types of objects. Current science distinguishes matter as different existents, but not as different types. In this science, we see two particles, and say that they exist in different locations, although they are of the same type (i.e. they are both particles). This view has its roots in the notion that locations in space identify different existents, but not distinct types. The causal laws of nature too are defined for each type of object and not for every individual existent. Thus, the same law applies to a very large number of objects. Contrast this with a semantic space, where each object is a different existent because it is a different type. For instance, each object can be different because it denotes a different concept—e.g., a table and a chair. This would imply that no two objects within a system can be exactly identical. Since the laws of nature are associated with different types of objects, each object must obey different laws. To do science, we need to associate the law with the type of object. A science that subsumes many types of objects under the rubric of a single type of law will be causally incomplete as compared to a science that associates a unique type of law with each distinct type of object.
 
&gt;Two objects in separate locations in non-semantic space can have the same type. But two objects in a semantic space are in separate locations because they have different types. If something has a distinct type, then it must also be a separate existent. Type distinctions are therefore stronger than existence distinctions. Semantic space simply means that all things in a space are distinct not just as existents but also as types. There are as many types in the universe as there are locations in the universe. The law governing each object is relative to the type of object. Since each location is a unique type, there are as many unique laws as there are locations. In a semantic space, the laws of nature are tied to locations in space. Unless two locations are semantically analogous, objects at that location will have different behaviors. In current science, all locations in space are identical, and the notion of universal law is achieved by dropping the type distinctions between locations. Of course, in many cases, it is possible to partially ignore the type distinction amongst objects; for example, we can treat all humans to be of the same type. If we now draw laws of human nature and attempt to predict human behavior based on these laws, we will find that that these laws describe human behaviors to some level of accuracy, but, ultimately, these laws are incomplete because the universality of the law hinges on the idea that all humans have the same type, which is false. Laws of human nature will be incomplete, because they ignore type dif-ferences between humans. Similarly, in a semantic space, any theory that subsumes a variety of things into a single class of objects, regardless of the object’s location within space, will be incomplete. 

&gt;It is well-known that almost all areas of modern science are in-complete. These include mathematics, computing, physics, and biology. It is however less widely known that mathematics and computing are incomplete because completeness requires the ability to distinguish between things, names and concepts although names and concepts cannot be distinguished from objects in physical space. At the root of this problem is the fact that mathematics treats space non-semantically, and entities in this space are different identities but not different types. The assumption that two different objects in the same space denote different types contradicts the idea that all locations and directions in space are essentially identical. 

&gt;Physical theories in particular are based on the idea that there are a few types of things in the universe and hence a handful of laws that apply to these few types of things. Different physical theories are conceived in different types of spaces. To reconcile these theories, we must first reconcile the spaces of different objects. 

&gt;Unfortunately, this reconciliation has been very difficult be-cause science believes that the only way two types of things can exist in a single space is if they are described by a new single type. This is often called unification in science where two diverse types of phenomena are explained as ‘surface’ symptoms of a deeper type. To conceive a more general type of thing, scientists postulate spaces with a greater number of dimensions than the dimensions needed for spaces of the individual phenomena. This has led to incredibly complex multi-dimensional theories of nature and scientists assert that these other dimensions are very small and therefore not commonly perceived. That also makes empirical verification of such theories highly problematic, if not impossible. The semantic space approach changes the landscape of how different types are supposed to exist in the same space. In this new view, we don’t require additional dimensions in space to incorporate additional types. We only need to treat locations in space as denoting different types of things. There are thus not additional dimensions in space to incorporate different types of things. Rather, location itself represents a type.

&gt;In current scientific theories, laws represent types of things, and physical properties represent existents. Their distinction arises because we suppose that there are many things in the universe but only a few types of things and eventually our laws will reconcile everything to a single type. But what if there were as many types of things as there are things so that we can drop the divide between things and types? If the distinction between existence and type is dissolved, there is room for a new kind of science that does not have the incompleteness that exists in almost all areas of science today. This is because we will no longer subsume many things into a fewer type of things. Since laws are associated with types, by allowing as many types of things as there are things, we will allow as many laws as there are objects. The law is now a function of the type. To predict the behavior of a thing, we must first know its type. This shift requires a change in current notions about space-time. Now, two objects in different locations are different types of objects.  

&gt;There are four kinds of space in Vedic philosophy called vaikhari, madhyamā, paśyanti and parā and they correspond to four kinds of experiences—waking, dreaming, deep-sleep and transcendent. Locations in these spaces create semantic distinctions be-tween bodies, minds, personalities and souls, respectively. This means that different bodies, minds, personalities and souls are not just different existents, but they are also different types of existents. Distinctions in parā are manifest in paśyanti which are manifest in madhyamā and eventually manifest in vaikhari. Thus, material creation manifests the pre-existent, eternal distinctness between souls first into the distinction between personalities, which is then manifest into distinct minds, subsequently manifesting distinct bodies. The body, of course, denotes distinctions between bodies, but it also represents distinctions between minds, personalities and souls. To see these distinctions, new ways of interpreting the bodily states are needed. Accordingly, the body can be described in many ways, representing a type of object, a type of mind, a type of person and eventually a type of soul. Note that the distinction between types implies a distinction in identity, but the distinction between (physical) identities does not always imply different types. The type distinction includes the identity distinction, although the reverse is not true. 

&gt;My body and your body are not just different bodies, but different kinds of bodies. The difference between our bodies is based on different types of matter that makes them up, but also indicates different types of minds, personalities and souls. To distinguish different bodies, we need to understand type differences amongst the bodies. If a body moves from one location to another, it is transforming from one type of body to another. This view changes many fundamental notions about motion in current science. Motion in classical physics is a change in location without change in identity. Thus, a particle moves without changing its type and the law at earlier and new locations is the same law. Motion in a semantic space is however a change in types. The cause underlying this change is the cause that changes type not just location. If the object changes type during motion, then laws at earlier and new locations are different. The laws of the body at present are different from the laws that were applicable in the past and will be different in the future, because the laws are tied to the types and the body is changing its type.

&gt;If space-time is semantic, then everything currently construct-ed in science is incomplete. This is because, in current science, we subsume many distinct things into limited classes of things, which have limited usefulness. The resulting scientific description is in-complete and leads to the impression that matter is non-semantic. Non-semantic views of matter now conflict with everyday semantic notions of matter, including the idea that we have minds which sense, conceive, judge, intend and enjoy. To fix this erroneous view of matter within science, science needs to revise its current notions of space-time. A shift in how we view the nature of space-time has the potential to resolve the conflict between semantic and non-semantic languages, and eventually the conflict between scientific and religious viewpoints. This resolution is based on new scientific notions, and not on faith. The ideas towards this resolution are in-deed drawn from Vedic philosophy which is considered revealed knowledge rather than researched knowledge. But, hopefully, in the search of truth, we wouldn’t care where the truth comes from. 

&gt;Vedic notions about space-time have many scientific consequences, which I will not discuss in this book. These are discussed at length in my book entitled Sāńkhya and Science. The brief expose of Vedic ideas above, and its relation to science, is meant to show that the debate between creationist and evolutionist ideologies depends on some simple scientific questions. Does the observer’s ability to draw boundaries in space have real effects in matter? Do distinctions of locations in space represent real physical properties? Are objects fundamentally point particles or extended forms? Are all directions in space and time equivalent? Depending on how these questions are answered, there can be a new science in which matter will be described in a new way. This book does not discuss the scientific implications of Vedic ideas, how they can lead to new theories, and their new empirical consequences. This book assumes that the Vedic viewpoint is correct, and describes at length—in a lay person’s language—the intricacies of this viewpoint. 

&gt;What Western philosophy calls the ‘mind’ has many parts in Vedic philosophy which correspond to different kinds of meanings. The senses have sensations, such as color. The mind holds concepts, such as white. The intelligence cognizes objects such as a table. The ego perceives intentions, such as the idea that this is my table. Consciousness associates morality to intentions. These different types of meanings arise in relation to different aspects of the observer and they create different properties in matter. Thus, there are many kinds of semantic properties in matter, which can be understood through a deeper understanding of the observer. Various ways of dividing, combining and relating semantic objects pertain to the ways in which consciousness uses its choices. The properties and capabilities of consciousness can thus be studied in matter through the ways in which meanings are formed by divisions, combinations and relations. Consciousness does not reduce to matter, although it has material effects by which its nature can be understood. 

&gt;The conflict between creationist and evolutionist viewpoints hinges on different notions about space, time and matter. Although detailed scientific implications of these differences are not explored here, I hope that the reader can see that these differences are not a matter of faith. They rather represent different material ideologies which can be used to develop alternative scientific theories. The semantic viewpoint indicates a science based on the capabilities in consciousness, rather than the properties of objects as they exist independent of consciousness. This book aims to describe the Vedic ideas on matter and creation. I would refer the readers interested in the implications of these ideas to modern science to other books, such as Sāńkhya and Science, Quantum Meaning and Gödel’s Mistake.

I came across this analogy and wanted to get your thoughts on its accuracy:

A group of French monks, who do not speak Spanish, do nothing but copy _Don Quixote_ over and over all day long. Because they speak no Spanish, their copying, while quite good, occasionally introduces random mistakes into the text. The monks send each copy to eager readers in Spain. The copies that are appreciated by the readers in Spain are returned to France, where the monks receive and then re-copy the book, tossing the old copies out the windows of the monastery. And the process repeats indefinitely. Darwinian evolution would predict that, over millions of years, the novel that began as _Don Quixote_ could eventually become _War and Peace_.

Jubilees is considered one of the pseudepigrapha by Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox Churches.[1] It is also not considered canon within Judaism outside of the Beta Israel.

&gt;It was well known to Early Christians, as evidenced by the writings of Epiphanius, Justin Martyr, Origen, Diodorus of Tarsus, Isidore of Alexandria, Isidore of Seville, Eutychius of Alexandria, John Malalas, George Syncellus, and George Kedrenos. The text was also utilized by the community that originally collected the Dead Sea Scrolls. No complete Greek or Latin version is known to have survived, but the Ge'ez version has been shown to be an accurate translation of the version found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

I am a Messianic Christian. This last month a friend enlightened me to this book after I shared my interest in the Garden of Eden, more specifically the Tree of Life.

As a Christian for over 30 years I've never been interested in non-canonical writings or books as many are anonymous and not included in the Bible. What caught my interest in this book was how many copies of the Book of Jubilees counted among the Dead Sea Scrolls: 15.

I am writing a Christian thriller inspired by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker. Peretti is best known for his novels This Present Darkness (1986) and Piercing the Darkness (1989). Ted Dekker is best known for his Circle series of novels: Black, Red, White and Green. (PS: He is releasing a fifth in the series soon, The 49th Mystic (Beyond the Circle))

Considering how Judaism treasures the Dead Sea Scrolls and Rabbinical writings/tradition, I'm submitting this for consideration for discussion.

Creation,8fwqzy,NesterGoesBowling,,,self.Creation,,Systems Biology: a predictive quantitative program for biology using an ID-based framework,"&gt; According to evolutionary materialism, there is no purpose. Recently, a Finnish physics teacher bluntly distilled this view when he commented publicly that ""an adjustable wrench has a purpose but life has no purpose."" Yes, that assessment defies our most powerful intuitions, but set that aside for the moment.

&gt; There is a more tangible problem with the claim: It leads to failed predictions. This type of evolutionary thinking has encouraged such notions as vestigial organs and junk DNA, since blind processes often produce waste and poor solutions. The theory of intelligent design sees biology through different spectacles. Both of these paradigms can be predictive and offer explanations for various biological realities. But which one better reflects reality?

&gt; During the last several years a new field in biological sciences, called systems biology, has emerged. It is concerned with ""why"" and ""for what purpose"" questions. University of Pittsburgh physics professor David Snoke has described how the use of teleological concepts and terms is widespread in contemporary systems biology, and said the scientists in that discipline therefore are actually working under a design framework rather than an evolutionary one. ""Many have demanded that the intelligent design paradigm must come up with a successful, predictive, quantitative program for biology,"" he commented, ""but it seems that such a program already exists right under our noses."" (Snoke, BIO-Complexity 3, 2014:1-11)

Creation,8eu8xi,stcordova,Molecular Bio/Phys research assistant,,self.Creation,,"Creation Science Audio Conference Website, Free Science Classes for Beginners","The multiplayer gaming community needed a means of allowing players to communicate with each other and hence a system known as ""DISCORD"" was created.  It's free, and imho, it's better than Skype for some purposes.  DISCORD turned out to have way more uses than just for video gaming interactions.  :-)

If anyone wants to have and audio conference with me and others, they can join by installing the DISCORD system on their computer.  There are several groups on DISCORD (aka ""servers"").  I own the Creation Science server.

Join with this link.  A few people from r/creation have already joined.

I'm thinking of hosting a discussion at 8PM EST/EDT tomorrow, Thursday April 26, 2018.  We can negotiate another meeting time than tomorrow.  Just speak up and say what works for you.  The interactions are anonymous at your discretion....

To see what this is like, I posted a recorded interaction I had with the Republicans (GOPcord) about Creation and Intelligent Design here:

There are a lot of creation/ID conferences happening around the country, but this involves travel expenses and huge time commitment.   

In lieu of this we can meet on DISCORD.  There is a mode where we can also video conference for FREE!   I can screen share and teach molecular biology and biochemistry WAAAAY better than I would on reddit.

Sooooo, if you have high school level understanding of science, I'm happy to teach you some molecular biology that would be helpful in arguing against evolutionary theory.

I emphasize the importance of molecular biology here, and it's a lot easier to learn than you might think:

I did look into this for quiet some time and there are a few skeletons I have problems with.
I just recently concluded that the Peking man must be fully human. I mean look at the similarities to an Aboriginal Skull, a modern human.
But what about the Turkana Boy? The skull doesn't look that much like a human to me, but it must be one as we have a full skeleton of him.
Then again creatonists say the Java man isn't human because of the nearly non existent forehead, the turkana boy has a nearly identical forehead though.
And there are some even ""older"" fossils that I would clearly say are ape like, but still look somewhat similar to the turkana boy. So now I have no idea what to do.
Maye someone can help me with this and can tell me exactly what is human and what is not.",9,1524507075,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8edkwi/how_can_some_apes_look_very_similar_to_human/

Creation,8ebzsi,nomenmeum,,,self.Creation,,Question about fold mountains and erosion...,"[""Fold Mountains:](https://www.universetoday.com/29833/how-mountains-are-formed/)
As the name suggests, fold mountains occur when two tectonic plates collide at a convergent plate boundary, causing the crust to overthicken. This process forces the less dense crust to float on top of the denser mantle rocks – with material being forced upwards to form hills, plateaus or mountains – while a greater volume of material is forced downward into the mantle.""


Has anyone done a study comparing the rate of mountain formation by this process with the rate of mountain erosion by wind and rain?  I know both processes are slow, but at least I can see the effects of erosion.  I haven't been paying attention, but I suspect the process of mountain folding might escape the naked eye.  It seems like there should be a problem if erosion is faster than mountain folding.",13,1524494834,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8ebzsi/question_about_fold_mountains_and_erosion/

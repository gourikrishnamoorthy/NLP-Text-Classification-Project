This is building off of some recent discussions related to “genetic entropy”. Before we get too far, some terms need defining, so we’re all on the same page. 

*Some* creationists might disagree with some of these definitions. Tough luck. These are the biological definitions, not the creationist versions. 

Mutation: Any change to the base sequence of a DNA molecule.

Neutral: Does not affect fitness.

Deleterious: Hurts fitness

Beneficial: Helps fitness

Fitness: Reproductive success.

Got it? Great. Let’s do this.

&amp;nbsp;

**Section 1. Equilibrium**

The first thing we need to cover is perhaps a bit counterintuitive, but extremely important: There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur. 

There are two main reasons for this.

The first is very simple: Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations. Consider a single base, which can exist in state a or a’, where a’ represents a mutation. Once that mutation occurs, a --&gt; a’ is no longer possible, but a’ --&gt; a has become possible. If there is a fitness effect to the original mutation (i.e. it is not neutral), its occurrence changes the distribution of fitness effects going forward. 

So why does this matter? Consider a larger but still extremely oversimplified scenario. Ten bases. Each one has three potential mutations (because there are four possible bases at each site, and each site can only be one at a time). Let’s say for each of these ten sites, one of the possible mutations is beneficial, and the other two are equally deleterious, and all are equally likely. 

So at the start, the ratio of possible beneficial mutations to deleterious is 1:2, and assuming they’re all equally likely, we’d expect deleterious mutations to occur at about twice the rate as beneficial. Right?

Wrong.

Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we *also* remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s *2* beneficial and 1 *neutral*. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.

after 2: 12/2/16.

after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)

One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial. 

Now, that’s pretty unrealistic; beneficial mutations are quite rare. 

So let’s remove them. Now consider each site with 1 neutral and 2 deleterious mutations possible.

After 1 mutation, we go from 0/10/20 to 2/10/18 (because the original neutral mutation became beneficial relative to the new genotype, the deleterious mutation that occurred is off the table, the other becomes neutral, relative to the one that occurred, and the back mutation is beneficial.)

So keep that going:

2 mutations: 4/10/16

3 mutations: 6/10/14. Majority not deleterious. 

At 5 mutations, it becomes 10/10/10. 

[Figure 1.]( https://i.imgur.com/3TMbDY6.png
)

First two scenarios graphed. X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is number of possible mutations. Red line is deleterious mutations, blue is beneficial in first scenario, green is beneficial in second. 

&amp;nbsp;

You can play with these number however you want. Genome size, percentage of bases that are selectable, frequency of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious. As long as you permit neutral mutations, you’ll always hit an equilibrium point at some number of deleterious mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

In fact, let’s model that more specifically. 

Let’s say, what, 99% of mutations are deleterious, and only 0.1% are beneficial. And also that there is zero selection. Is that sufficiently pessimistic for creationists? And let’s work with 1000 sites.

So the expected ratio at the start, in percentages, would be 0.1/0.9/99 b/n/d. 

But as deleterious mutations accumulate, the ratio changes, just like the simple examples above. Where’s the crossover point? About 330 deleterious mutations. That’s where beneficial become more likely. 

[Figure 2.]( https://i.imgur.com/hMShpg9.png
)

X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is frequency of mutations. Red line is deleterious, blue is beneficial. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, these are of course not linear relationships. The probably changes with each mutation, not just at the crossover point where beneficial becomes more likely. So as each mutation occurs, the downward slop of deleterious mutations (i.e. the rate at which that occur) decreases, while the upward slope of beneficial mutations also decreases. The result is that they asymptotically approach the equilibrium point, resulting in a genome that is at dynamic equilibrium between beneficial and harmful mutations. 

And *that*, my friends, is the first reason why harmful mutations cannot accumulate at a constant rate over time. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact. Say you have two sites: J and K, and they can be J (normal) or j (mutation). It can be the case that j and k, each on their own, are deleterious, but together are beneficial. So just considering these two sites, you start off with two possible deleterious mutations and zero possible beneficial mutations. But if J --&gt; j occurs, now you have two possible beneficial mutations (j back to J, or K to k), and zero possible deleterious mutations. This type of thing is well known – it’s part of the [lobster trap model]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01223.x
) of why we can’t get rid of antibiotic resistance.

In the above examples, we’re not considering epistasis, but it would also be occurring. So with each harmful mutation that occurs, not only are you changing the frequencies as described above, you’re *also* turning previously deleterious mutations into beneficial mutations. So in addition to making extremely unrealistic assumptions with regard to the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations, *and* completely omitting selection, we’re *also* leaving out this additional factor that facilitates reaching this equilibrium point faster. 

&amp;nbsp;

So put these two things together, and I hope everyone reading can see why we can’t assign absolute fitness values to specific mutations, how the occurrence of one mutation can cause the fitness effects of other mutations to change, and how that inevitably leads to an equilibrium where beneficial and deleterious mutations occur at the same rate. And why all that means you can’t, as Sanford et al. want to do, allow deleterious mutations to accumulate at a constant rate, even without selection. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 2. Mutation-Selection Balance**

That’s all well and good, but all of that stuff only deals with mutations. We need to talk about the other side of the ledger: Selection.

Adding selection introduces a new concept: Mutation-selection balance. Though I hope it is clear, the point of this section will be to explain how and why, once we add selection to the equation, the equilibrium we found above shifts away from deleterious mutations (because they are selected out of the population).

In order for this to happen, the strength of selection must be high enough for the selection to operate. The strength of selection is more technically called the *selection differential*, the fitness difference between individuals with a specific mutation and the average population fitness. If the difference is large enough, that mutation can be selected for or against (depending on the sign of the differential). 

The rate at which mutations are selected out is based on the rate at which they occur and the selection differential. 

Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated. I don’t know where this threshold is supposed to be, and I don’t think creationists know either, but the fact that it must exist (because if it doesn’t, then creationists are in effect arguing that deleterious mutations can accumulate in a linear fashion without affecting fitness, which is the opposite of what Sanford claims wrt “genetic entropy”) means that *at some point* as mutations occur, selection against deleterious mutations *will* begin to occur. This will slow the rate at which deleterious mutations accumulate, ultimately resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between mutations occurring and being selected out.

&amp;nbsp;

Considering this in the context of what we modeled above, we have two options for what can occur:

1) The selection threshold (the number of mutations that must occur for selection to kick in) is beyond the equilibrium point. In this scenario, the genome in question settles at the equilibrium described above, without selection affecting the number of deleterious mutations. 

or

2) The selection threshold is *before* the “no selection” equilibrium, in which case the genome in question settles at a *different* equilibrium, one with *fewer* deleterious mutations that expected based on the above models. 

Under either case, you still arrive at an equilibrium at which deleterious mutations stop accumulating. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 3. Why this matters for “genetic entropy”**

Now, with all that in mind, I’m going to provide a mechanistic description of how “genetic entropy” supposedly works. I’m going to use Sanford’s (and other creationists’) language here, even though they use several terms incorrectly. 

According to Sanford, the process works like this: Most mutations are deleterious, but the effects are so small they have no effect on reproductive output. But they are still harmful to the fitness (health, function, etc.) of the organism. Over time, as these unselectable “very slightly deleterious mutations” accumulate in every individual, the overall health and ultimately the overall reproductive output of the population decline to below the level of replacement, ultimately resulting in extinction. 

See the problem?

In order for this to happen, two things must be true: There is no selection against deleterious mutations *even as reproductive output declines* (this is literally a contradiction), and deleterious mutations *must constantly accumulate* (impossible, as we saw above). 

Which means “genetic entropy” simply does not work. Period. 

And one more point: Assuming selection *does* occur (which, like, natural selection occurs, y’all), the implication is that every organism, every *genome* exists right on the precipice of experiencing a deleterious mutation and getting selected out, all the time. But we’ve adapted the repair mistakes, and live at an equilibrium where most mutations don’t do anyone one way or the other.  

Sanford’s argument *assumes* special creation because it *requires* an optimal “starting point” from which everything inevitably decays. That’s not what we see. Every genome has existed right on this knife’s edge, forever. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 4. Additional Points**

This is not an answer to every anti-evolution argument. This is an answer to one specific anti-evolution argument: “genetic entropy”.

If you, dear reader, think I am wrong, and that “genetic entropy” is a real thing that occurs, explain why the above reasoning is faulty. *Show your work*. 

That would involve showing how, given a realistic (or even an unrealistic, like those above) set of assumptions, deleterious mutations actually *do* accumulate constantly in a genome. 

It would *not* involve changing the topic to things like “well mutation and selection can’t build complex structures” or “selection constantly removes functions”. Those are *different* anti-evolution arguments, also invalid, *but are not the topic of this thread*. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 5: TL;DR**

Seriously? Just read the damn thing. 

Just kidding. 

For the normies who don’t think about this stuff during most waking (and some non-waking) moments, the point is that as bad mutations occur, the frequency of possible bad mutations decreases, and possible good mutations increases, eventually reaching equilibrium. Selection shifts that equilibrium further away from bad mutations. Since “genetic entropy” requires constant accumulation of bad mutations, and no selection against them, it can’t work.

DebateEvolution,etjksh,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.DebateEvolution,,I was asked to repost this here,"The RNA World Hypothesis

The RNA World Hypothesis: The Failure of Modern Origin-of-Life Theories

The RNA world hypothesis is the most developed origin-of-life theories so far, and it tries to explain how information in DNA, metabolism, and life itself originated. However, this post will show the utter failure of this theory to actually explain the origin of life.

The main premise of this theory is that, before the first living cells originated, the prebiotic world was composed of RNA and, later, RNA viruses. As RNA has been seen to self-replicate in some cases, and ribozymes, or catalytic enzymes like polymerases made of RNA, have been shown to exist, it is assumed that RNA could take the place of both DNA and proteins.

Once the first ribozyme polymerase (able to copy other RNA strands) originated, then strands could replicate, and the laws of natural selection and mutation could take over from there. As more and more complex ribozymes began to originate, and simple lipid cell membranes took them into their cavities, then simple metabolism could evolve. After this, ribonucleoproteins such as ribosomes could take over, and finally, simple cellular life could evolve.

The first hurdle that this theory comes to is the chemical evolution of nucleobases (A, U, G, and C). These are the molecules that encode information in DNA and cause ribozymes to work. Although some scientists suggest that specific nucleobases, such as adenine (A) [can be made by natural processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077245/), others accept that [nucleobases are unlikely to be created naturally](https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4396). Even to make a 0.5% concentration of adenine take unrealistically high concentrations of HCN that likely did not exist in early oceans. In our cells, there is a complex sequence of specific, metabolic proteins to make nucleobases. Also, the reaction that makes nucleobases from HCN makes many undesirable products that would interfere with RNA production.

Also, nucleobases have [very short half-lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20907/). At the temperatures of hydrothermal vents (more than 100 degrees Celsius), cytosine has a half-life of only 19 days, which means that the origin of life would have to have take place within only several years. I can’t stress enough how unlikely this would be.

The second hurdle the theory comes to is the making of ribose sugar. Ribose is the first component of the backbone of RNA (and the R in RNA). There is already a natural process that makes this sugar called the [formose reaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) which begins with formaldehyde. This has even been observed to take place at the temperatures and pressures of hydrothermal vents. The only problem with this is that [it cannot take place in the presence of nitrogenous compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453009), such as the ones that are formed from the production of nucleobases, This is because nitrogenous compounds would chemically react with the formaldehyde that is needed to start the reaction.

So, proponents of the RNA world theory need to explain how ribose could be made apart from the nucleobases, then come in contact with them in a high enough concentration to provoke a *thermodynamically uphill reaction*.

This brings us to the theory’s third hurdle, which is the making of nucleotides. These are the fundamental units of RNA, that are made from a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate ion. To form this, there would need to be a high concentration of phosphate. However, because phosphate is an ion, it is generally trapped in stable minerals. Any free PO^-3 will be quickly ‘snapped up’ by free calcium ions in the ocean. Though [some origin-of-life researchers think this could be solved with sulfur](https://cosmosmagazine.com/chemistry/life-without-phosphate-mystery-solved), there is no known analogue to RNA with anything other than phosphate.

Another problem with this is that the combination of nucleobases, ribose, and phosphate is a *thermodynamically uphill* reaction. To make nucleotides would require an outside source of energy and an extremely high concentration of each of these things, which is unlikely for the reasons previously mentioned.

Also, you need to make sure that the right nitrogen atom from the nucleobase bonds with the right carbon atom on the ribose sugar. In studies, only [8% of bonds were in the right place](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar50083a002), showing that even if the molecules did combine to form a nucleotide, 92% of them would be wrong, so any RNA strand formed from these would be extremely unlikely to work.

The final challenge to this theory, and the most problematic, is the actual forming of ribozymes. Even assuming that a significant concentration of nucleotides were formed, there are only a few sequences that actually produce an enzyme, so we run into the same problem as specified information in DNA.

Natural selection and copying could only begin after the first ribozyme polymerase was formed. [The shortest effective one yet is called 24-3](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9786), and it needs a specific sequence of bases 188 nucleotides in length to work. The chance of this forming randomly is one in 4^188, or approximately one in 10^113. Even assuming that the concentration was enough to produce a new RNA sequence every second, the chance of this forming in a million years is still one in 10^99. Given that, at best, life is given a billion years in evolutionary time to form, you can be sure that the RNA world literally would never form “in a billion years”.

DebateEvolution,esr9ns,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Mutation: Evidence for Common Ancestry?,"Is mutation the mechanism for gene creation, speciation, and common ancestry?

It is the Great White Hope, that the belief in common ancestry depends upon.

The belief:
*Random mutations have produced all the variety and complexity we see today, beginning with a single cell.*

This phenomenon has never been observed, cannot be repeated in rigorous laboratory conditions, flies in the face of observable science, yet is pitched as 'settled science!'

*Does mutation 'create' genes?*

No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'  Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.  

**E Coli**

I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

The ability to digest citrates, and mutate, does NOT indicate speciation, nor macro evolution.  It is an adaptation that ecoli was able to do, from inherent genetic abilities.  There is no indication of 'new genes!', or structural changes in the genome.   Ecoli remained ecoli, after over 66,000 generations, only adapting to micro climate conditions.   It is not proof, or evidence of, common ancestry.

Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  It is a deleterious process, that creates nothing.  The complex  features in living things cannot be explained by mutation..  the leap from a single celled amoeba to even a bacteria is untraceable and unexplainable by mutation.  The eye, flight, warm blood..  and countless variety in living organisms have no indication or evidence of being *caused* by mutation. There is nothing observable or repeatable, to compel a conclusion of mutation as an engine of increasing complexity.   It is a belief, with no empirical evidence.

Observation tells us that mutations are neutral, at best, or deleterious to the organism. It is not a creative power for complexity.  Even the claim of 'neutrality!' is based on presumption and decree.

The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen.

An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

A mutation only alters an existing trait, (or gene, exactly). It is not a selective process, but a deleterious one, that degrades the organism in almost every case.

Ecoli, adapting to digest citrates, is not evidence for common ancestry. It only shows the adaptability of this unique organism. It is not becoming anything else, or changing its genomic architecture.  It is still ecoli.

The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.  There is  no credible evidence of 'gene creation!' in any study to date. Mutations are not, 'new genes!' Selection, acting on existing variability, does not indicate new genes. Traits, variability, fantastically complex features.. hearing, seeing, flight, intelligence.. almost every trait known in the animal and plant kingdom have no empirical source. The belief in mutation, as a mechanism of increasing complexity has no scientific basis.   It is a religious belief, only.",77,1579775321,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/esr9ns/mutation_evidence_for_common_ancestry/

Oh? Not an issue.

&gt;According to a robotically repeated talking point favored by evolution proponents, loyal adherence to Darwin’s theory is crucial to the future of biological research. Informing the public, including students, about the theory’s weaknesses as well as its strengths would thus threaten not only the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. It would even put lives in peril, since medical research would be handicapped. This might or might not explain the addled logic of a phone message we got over the past weekend from a critic of intelligent design who threatened that ID proponents are guilty of “treason” and should be handled by the law accordingly.

&gt;Yikes! Endangering your country’s health and wellbeing, if that were the case, would certainly not be a laudable act. But is a skeptical view of Darwinian theory really “anti-science,” as other critics like to say? Well, when you find something amazing, and there are countless amazing things in biology, you want to understand it. Does that require a Darwinian just-so story? These news items show otherwise. Students might become more motivated to study science, in fact, if given a sense of awe at nature’s wonders, without the usual appeals to happenstance.

Sounds like a strawman to me.

&gt;News from New York University begins without Darwin, and continues to approach the subject of DNA repair free of evolutionary shackles.

&gt;The scientists made DNA glow green, and introduced breaks that glowed red. Watching the reactions, they found that broken areas became denser and moved more quickly as repair processes acted on them. No evolution was required to increase understanding that could potentially better our health.

Oh? https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-26887-1_11
Learning why, is just as important as well as the how it works.

&gt;Those who like to bake salmon have undoubtedly been struck by the chevron shapes in the muscles. All fish have this characteristic pattern, which “is thought to increase swimming efficiency,” according to research from the National University of Singapore (NUS). How does the pattern come about? Is it genetically driven, or is there some other process at work? The scientists didn’t even consider Darwinian evolution as they sought the answer.

&gt;Notably, several mentions of evolution in the PNAS paper have nothing to do with Darwinism, but rather with the unfolding (“evolution”) of the patterns during development. One brief exception mentions that “the shape is tightly controlled and may be evolutionarily optimized.” Performing a Darwin-ectomy on that sentence would cause no harm to the science.

Yes, because we shouldn't consider how these processes come about. I mean it's not like embryology is important to evolution yes? https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-beneficial-consequences-of-having-chevron-or-V-shaped-myomeres-illustrated-using_fig2_225306766

&gt;Another paper in PNAS about epigenetics does perfectly fine without appeals to Darwinian evolution. The “Perspective” article by Aristizabel et al., “Biological embedding of experience: A primer on epigenetics,” includes only one reference to “evolutionary time”:

Yes, because passing on modified genes has nothing to do with evolution huh?

 &gt;As more scientific research proceeds in the absence of references to unguided evolution, science will get stronger, leaner, and more motivated. Let the Darwin stories go, and free up science for a resurgence of awe and wonder that first motivated early scientists.

Evolution is not a force in off itself, but of multiple processes like DNA repair, mutations, embryology. Evolution is the umbrella that brings these studies together and how they affect one another. 

Likewise these studies only show what is going on but not why...as in why things are this way. 

By telling people to ignore Darwinism then, you are limiting their curosity.

&gt;It will take some radical surgery to remove the Darwinian concepts in the Grants’ paper, but will the science survive? Take a closer look at what they actually found. First of all, they admit that the effect of introgressive hybridization on adaptive radiation is “not known.” Ponder that for a moment. After 160 years, has Darwinism been so useless that it has not shed light on a process that should have been well known by now, particularly with these iconic birds? Even worse, though, is that introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system. Search for “selection” in the paper and you find only faith, not evidence, that natural selection might work in tandem with introgressive hybridization to produce new species. The only examples of selection they offer involve microevolution, not innovation. For those, they do lateral passes to other Darwinists in the references. 

Wait what did you say?
&gt;introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system.

But you are describing evolution but say that it isn't evolution. Decent by modification! How does shuffilling around genetic information not cause an increase in information?!

&gt;Their work not only relies on Darwinism, but promises to help future research. How could anyone claim that Darwinism is useless to this paper? Actually, it’s quite easy. It’s as easy as showing that any other kind of circular reasoning is useless in science. These seven biologists assumed evolution, and concluded evolution. The observations had nothing to do with it.

From the study they link to: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/42/21094.short

&gt;Echolocation is a prime example of convergent evolution, the independent gain of similar features in species of different lineages. Is phenotypic convergence driven by underlying molecular convergence? If so, could molecular convergence include contributions from highly constrained, often-pleotropic, coding regions? We develop a generalizable test that offers a resounding “yes” to both extensively debated questions. Our test highlights molecular convergence in genes regulating the cochlear ganglion of echolocating bats and whales, the skin of aquatic mammals, and the lung of high-altitude mammals. Importantly, the approach correctly dismisses confounding convergence-like patterns, such as those from sequence decay of vision genes in blind subterranean species, and is readily applicable to the thousands of genomes sequenced across the tree of life.

How do they respond?

&gt;Some extreme examples can show the fallacy. Humans and turtles can hold their breath underwater. Is that convergent evolution? Turtles can’t think, but humans can. Is that divergent evolution? If tricycles and race cars alike are found to contain both aluminum and iron, did they obtain those through blind, unguided processes? So it is with two very different mammals — bats and whales — that use sound for echolocation. Neither the similarities nor differences prove convergent evolution (or divergent evolution, for that matter), unless you start with that assumption. It’s a non sequitur to conclude they evolved.

It would be very problematic if many species were found that combined characteristics of different nested groupings. Some nonvascular plants could have seeds or flowers, like vascular plants, but they do not. Gymnosperms (e.g. conifers or pines) occasionally could be found with flowers, but they never are. Non-seed plants, like ferns, could be found with woody stems; however, only some angiosperms have woody stems.

Conceivably, some birds could have mammary glands or hair; some mammals could have feathers (they are an excellent means of insulation). Certain fish or amphibians could have differentiated or cusped teeth, but these are only characteristics of mammals.
These patterns are here because evolution predicts that a new trait will emerge from an existing trait. These traits will be cultivated by the environment as they will help organisms live long enough to reproduce and pass on those traits with modification.
A mix and match of characters would make it extremely difficult to objectively organize species into nested hierarchies. Unlike organisms, cars do have a mix and match of characters, and this is precisely why a nested hierarchy does not flow naturally from classification of cars. Indeed a designer wouldn't need to follow any patter because it wouldn't have the same limitation as evolution and thus wouldn't need to follow the same pattern.

DebateEvolution,er0vih,DefenestrateFriends,PhD Genetics/MS Medicine Student,t2_g050d,self.DebateEvolution,,An evaluation of the genetic entropy hypothesis by a genetic scientist,"Hi folks,  
   
I have been discussing the principle tenets of an allele-frequency hypothesis called “Genetic Entropy” with a proponent. Many of you have seen this hypothesis floating around on the sub before and many of you have given it critical feedback. I’m hoping to add to that conversation by highlighting some of the scientific and technical reasons why this hypothesis is unsupported. I’m mostly going to focus on the data and not on the downstream conclusions about creationism or word choices like “entropy.”   
 

*Background:*   
What is genetic entropy (GE)? GE is a hypothesis proposed by Dr. John Sanford which predicts that functionally deleterious single-nucleotide mutations are inherited with each generation and accumulate in the organism/population. The accumulation of these mutations is then hypothesized to result in the progressive loss of integrity (hence the “entropy”) in a genome causing increased disease prevalence and ultimately death of the organism. It is then argued that if GE occurs, evolution is not possible since the organism is progressively experiencing a degradation in fitness which is not surmounted by positive selection. Essentially this hypothesis is an extreme form of Error Catastrophe which postulates that all life on earth operates past the critical mutation rate threshold.  

These are the four basic premises that must be true for functionally deleterious mutations to accumulate:   
 

1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations

2) Most mutations are very small in effect

3) The vast majority of mutations are damaging

4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

 

*What are mutations?*   
   
Mutation: a variant or change in the heritable material of an organism. Normally, we refer to mutations as “variants” because of all the different forms and effects they can take on—substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, conversion, frame shift, extension, synonymous, non-synonymous, DNA/RNA, transposons, linear, circular, coding, non-coding, imprinting, methylation, base adducts, structural, non-structural, pathogenic, clinical, loss of function, gain of function, etc.  
 

When referring to a mutation, it’s important to adequately describe the type of mutation occurring. I primarily study human genetics and so I use the nomenclature proposed by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) with the database ascension and human genome version identifiers. For example, the genomic identifier for a single-nucleotide variant in one of my favorite genes, MC1R, is NC\_000016.9:g.89986117C&gt;A. The protein identifier for that same variant is NP\_002377.4:p.Arg151Ser and the coding DNA identifier is NM\_002386.3:c.451C&gt;A.  
 

The mutation rate in humans is something around 1.0 × 10^(−9) mutations/nucleotide/year (95% CI: 3.0 × 10^(−10)–2.5 × 10^(−9)), or 3.0 × 10^(−8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95% CI: 8.9 × 10^(−9)–7.0 × 10^(−8)). Some loci (coding is lower, non-coding is higher, chromatin access etc) mutate at different rates than others and de novo mutation rates are affected by life-history traits of the parents (age, exposures, etc) in a sex-specific manner. When measured directly, trio probands show between 20 and 155 de novo mutations per offspring with an average around 40. 

What is evolution?

1. Evolution is defined as the change in allele frequencies in a population over generations.

2. Evolution is a process that occurs by 6 mechanisms: mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating, recombination, and natural selection. Sometimes this is referred to as 4 primary and 2 ancillary mechanisms because mating and recombination fall under the natural selection umbrella.

3. Evolution is not abiogenesis.

4. Evolutionary processes explain the diversity of life on Earth.

5. Evolution is not a moral or ethical claim.

6. Evidence for evolution comes in the forms of anatomical structures, biogeography, fossils, direct observation, and molecular biology--namely genetics. Genetic evidence is overwhelming and outweighs the others.

7. There are many ways to differentiate species. The classification of species is a manmade construct, is somewhat arbitrary, and varies across fields.  


*What is neutral theory, nearly neutral theory, and selectionist theory?* 

Population genetics is often concerned with which mechanism of evolution contributes more to allele change frequencies in a population. The two primary mechanisms seem to be natural selection and genetic drift. Neutral theory posits that variation mainly arises from stochastic processes (i.e. genetic drift) which distribute functionally neutral alleles and was proposed by Kimura Motoo in 1955/1968. Nearly neutral theory is an extension of neutral theory proposed by Tomoko Ohta in 1973. She suggested that natural selection can be overpowered by genetic drift in special circumstances relating to the size of the effective mating population and allows for slightly deleterious mutations to reach fixation. Once the effective population size gets large enough, natural selection overtakes influence on that allele and it is purified from the population. Selectionist theory posits that variation is primarily due to advantageous alleles propagated in a population. Neutral theory is now mostly used as a null hypothesis to detect selection.  
 

Neutralist and selectionist mechanisms both contribute to variation within in populations. I should also mention that anyone trying to base their understanding of current evolutionary processes should not use publications from the 60’s and 70’s. These papers and theories were proposed nearly 50 years before we had the data to adequately interrogate their predictions. There are numerous errors in Kimura’s model (didn’t know how many base pairs there were in the human genome or about codon bias etc.), but many of the basic predictions were true.  
 

Here’s a paper that explains the history and evidences for neutral theory:   
 Hughes AL. Near neutrality: leading edge of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. *Ann N Y Acad Sci*. 2008;1133:162–179. doi:10.1196/annals.1438.001

Here is a paper that explains the problems with neutral theory:  
 Kern, A. D. &amp; Hahn, M. W. The Neutral Theory in Light of Natural Selection. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **35**, 1366–1371 (2018).

 

*What are neutral mutations?*

Much of the discussion seems to revolve around the definition and existence of neutral mutations. There seems to have been some confusion when articulating the GE position because it attempts to appropriate operational language from the neutral theory of evolution. Here are the correct definitions of these terms.  
   
The action of a mutation can be defined in one of two ways: operationally or functionally. The operational definition describes how the mutation propagates in a population. The functional definition describes what the mutation does at the molecular level to the organism.  
 

Kimura using the operational definitions of mutation, since the frequency is OPERATIONALLY dependent on the POPULATION SIZE:

(17a) the mutant is **advantageous** such that **2Nes&gt;&gt;1**

(17b) it is **deleterious** such that **2Nes &gt;&gt;1 in which s‘=-s**

(17c) it is **almost neutra**l such that **|2Nes| &lt;&lt; 1**.

Kimura using the functional definition of mutation, since the function of the allele depends on the FITNESS CONFERRED and NOT the population size:

“These results suggest that mutations having a **definite advantage or disadvantage** can not contribute greatly to the heterozygosity of an individual because of the **rare occurrence of advantageous mutations and rapid elimination of deleterious ones.”**

**“Assuming that the majority of molecular mutations due to base substitution is almost neutral for natural selection** and that they occur at the rate of 2 per gamete per generation\[...\]”

\[And several other places in this paper and in all of his works\]

Kimura, M. Genetic variability maintained in a finite population due to mutational production of neutral and nearly neutral isoalleles. *Genet. Res.* **11**, 247–270 (1968).  
 

Having a mastery and understanding of these terms is important because a mutation can be called operationally neutral but be functionally highly deleterious. This is why we consider the functional consequences of a mutation and not the operational descriptor. Here’s an example:   
 

If a deleterious mutation with *s* = −0.001 occurs in a population of *N* = 106, |*s*| is much greater than 1/(2*N*) = 5 × 3 10^(−7). The fitness of mutant homozygotes will be lower than that of wild-type homozygotes only by 0.002. This fitness difference is easily swamped by the large random variation in the number of offspring among different individuals, by which *s* is defined. By contrast, in the case of brother-sister mating *N* = 2, so that even a semi-lethal mutation with *s* = −0.25 will be called neutral. If this mutation is fixed in the population, the mutant homozygote has a fitness of 0.5 compared with the nonmutant homozygote. A fitness decrease of half is removed from the population by natural selection.  
   
Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **22**, 2318–42 (2005).

&amp;#x200B;

*Are the majority of mutations deleterious or neutral?* 

Proponents of the GE hypothesis are quick to point out that, “most experts in the field believe that the majority of mutations are deleterious.” Popular quotes are plucked from the works of:  
 

Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. The fitness effects of spontaneous mutations nearly unseen by selection in a bacterium with multiple chromosomes. *Genetics* **204**, 1225–1238 (2016).

Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley, P. D. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. *Nature Reviews Genetics* **8**, 610–618 (2007).

Keightley, P. D. &amp; Lynch, M. Toward a realistic model of mutations affecting fitness. *Evolution* **57**, 683–685 (2003).

Kimura, M. Model of effectively neutral mutations in which selective constraint is incorporated. *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.* **76**, 3440–3444 (1979).

&amp;#x200B;

Of note, GE proponents selectively misquote these works and apply the authors’ quotes to the entire genome when only the coding-regions are specifically addressed. For example:   
 

The GE proponent quotes Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007):

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small.”  
 

The full quote in context (ibid.): 

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However, there is **a class of mutations that we can term effectively neutral**. These are mutations **for which** ***Nes*** **is much less than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random genetic drift.** As such, the definition of neutrality **is operational rather than functional**; it depends on **whether natural selection is effective on the mutation in the population or the genomic context in which it segregates**, not solely on the effect of the mutation on fitness.”

These definitions form Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) are specifically referencing mutation accumulation (MA) assays which historically interrogated only coding-region mutations. More recent MA experiments often characterize whole genome mutations such as in Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. (2016).  Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) go on to say:   
 

“Unfortunately, accurate measurement of the **effects of single mutations is possible only when they have fairly large effects on fitness** (say &gt;1%; that is, a mutation that increases or decreases viability or fertility by more than 1%)”

“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95% and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50% of mutations are deleterious.**”

After being presented with the contextualized quotes, GE acolytes tend to ignore this dilemma and try to quote other sources such as the MA experiments conducted by Dillon *et al.* (2016). 

&amp;#x200B;

GE supporters believe that MA experiments adequately represent natural evolutionary phenomena and that the results favor the GE hypothesis. Here’s why that is untrue: 

1. MA experiments **do not allow natural selection to happen**, meaning that the deleterious mutations cannot be selected out from the populations.

2. Bacterial strains used in MA experiments have certain DNA repair genes **disabled so that MORE mutations occur** i.e.—not natural

3. The coding regions in these species represent **HUGE portions of their total genome 80-90% versus 10-20% noncoding**. The human genome is about 1% coding.

4. The **majority of mutations are not deleterious** \[as shown in these experiments and in direct opposition to GE premises stated earlier\] and that only rarely occurring mutations cause the fitness declination observed in these studies.

This means, MA experiments a) don't support GE in the slightest and b) are not analogs for human evolution.

Here are the results from Dillon *et al.* (2016) MA experiment:

In the M9MM environment, 4 mutation carriers even had greater fitness than the ancestral genome. This means that effects of the mutations are dependent on the environment i.e.—natural selection. Here are several quotes from that paper demonstrating that more neutral mutations occur than deleterious mutations even in the near absence of natural selection:

“Specifically, MA experiments **limit the efficiency of natural selection** by passaging replicate lineages through repeated single-cell bottlenecks.”

“Here, we measured the relative fitness of 43 fully sequenced MA lineages derived from *Burkholderia cenocepacia* HI2424 in three laboratory environments after they had been evolved **in the near absence of natural selection for 5554 generations**. Following the MA experiment, each lineage harbored a total **mutational load of 2–14 spontaneous mutations**, including base substitution mutations (bpsms), insertion-deletion mutations (indels), and whole-plasmid deletions.”

“Lastly, the genome of *B. cenocepacia* is composed of **6,787,380 bp (88.12%) coding DNA** and **915,460 bp (11.88%) noncoding DNA**. Although both bpsms and indels were observed more frequently than expected in noncoding DNA (bpsms: χ2 = 2.19, d.f. = 1, *P* = 0.14; indels: χ2 = 45.816, d.f. = 1, *P* &lt; 0.0001)”

“In combination, these results suggest that the fitness effects of **a majority of spontaneous mutations were near neutral, or at least undetectable**, with plate-based laboratory fitness assays. Given the average selection coefficient of each line and the number of mutations that it harbors, we can estimate that the **average fitness effect (*****s*****) of a single mutation was –0.0040 ± 0.0052 (SD) in TSOY, –0.0031 ± 0.0044 (SD) in M9MM+CAA, and –0.0017 ± 0.0043 (SD) in M9MM**.”

“Despite acquiring multiple mutations, the fitness of a number of MA lineages **did not differ significantly from the ancestral strain.** Further, the number of spontaneous mutations in a line **did not correlate with their absolute selection coefficients** in any environment (Spearman’s rank correlation; TSOY: d.f. = 41, *S* = 15742, rho = –0.1886, *P* = 0.2257; M9MM+CAA: d.f. = 41, *S* = 13190, rho = 0.0041, *P* = 0.9793; and M9MM: d.f. = 41, *S* = 16293, rho = –0.2303, *P* = 0.1374)”

“Because the fitness of many lineages with multiple mutations did not significantly differ from the ancestor, and because mutation number and fitness were not correlated, this study suggests **that most of the significant losses and gains in fitness were caused by rare, single mutations with large fitness effects.**”

“Here, we estimate that *s* ≅ 0 in all three environments, **largely because the vast majority of mutations appear to have near neutral effects on fitness**. These estimates **are remarkably similar** to estimates from studies of MA lines with fully characterized mutational load in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *S. cerevisiae* (Lynch *et al.* 2008; Heilbron *et al.* 2014), but are lower than estimates derived from unsequenced MA lineages (Halligan and Keightley 2009; Trindade *et al.* 2010).”

The GE proponent that I was discussing with ignored the paper’s conclusion and focused on this quote in the discussion section of the paper:   
 

""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007; Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""

After pointing out that these experiments are explicitly referring to coding-region mutations context, hyper mutation strains, or non-sequencing fitness assays which do not assess total mutations; the GE proponent again tried to quote mine Heilbron *et al.* (2014) paper: 

""After 644 generations of mutation accumulation, MA lines had accumulated an average of 118 mutations, and we found that average fitness across all lines decayed linearly over time.""

The conclusion of Heilbron *et al.* (2014) was ignored by the GE proponent: 

“These steps did not contain a significantly greater number of mutations than the remaining steps (mean of five largest steps: 9.0 mutations, mean of remainder: 7.9 mutations, paired *t*\-test: *P* = 0.285, *t*4 = 1.235). However, these large deleterious steps showed a significantly higher frequency of mutations in highly conserved core genes than other steps (χ2 goodness-of-fit test: *P* = 0.049, χ21 = 3.882; [Table S2](http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.114.163147/-/DC1/genetics.114.163147-6.pdf)). Therefore, large drops in fitness **are due to mutations in more important genes rather than due to a greater number of mutations**.”  
 

This is exactly what MA experiments are designed to do—normally natural selection prunes these heavily deleterious mutations from the population, however, NS is controlled in MA experiments and therefore this doesn’t happen. GE requires a greater number of deleterious mutations than neutral mutations which is the exact opposite of what this paper shows even in the near absence of NS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of pointing to contrived MA experiments to support GE, proponents should use sequencing data from humans and perform a real analysis. I have challenged GE supporters to do this on several occasions which have been ignored. Here is my analysis:   
 

Gómez-Romero et al. (2018) identified de novo mutations in the offspring of a trio proband. 58 mutations were found with 35x coverage on the parents and 100x on the child. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variants (barring PCR primer difficulties).

[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115)

The variants identified in this study can be found in Table S4: [https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf)

Using these 58 mutations, please exactly list their character as “neutral” “deleterious” or “beneficial.” Then let us know the method you employed, the ratio of deleterious to neutral, and at what point the child in this study will go “extinct.”

If you cannot do this simple task, then you cannot test GE and you lose.

**Hint: I have already done the analysis with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)**. The analysis can be viewed here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr\_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0)

Of the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.

Conclusion:   
The GE hypothesis is not supported by data and primarily relies on misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers. I'm calling this fallacy of misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers while never doing experiments (appropriated unapologetically and nonconsensually from another user) ""The Atheist Jesus."" This is a fallacy committed by those who believe quoting scientists is an adequate method to demonstrate scientific validity in the absence of hypothesis testing. For example:  
""Charles Darwin said \[XYZ\] about evolution, therefore evolution isn't true."" Charles Darwin is not ""The Atheist Jesus"" and his words carry no scientific validity until tested.

He says, ""It seems to say that there are not very many ways in which proteins can evolve, but this is exactly what ID science has determined already."" Except that's not what the article says, and that's not what ID claims, either.

[The paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1126/science.1123539) is from Science, 312(5770), 111–114.

The quick and dirty is that scientists observed that a certain (Beta)-lactamase allele increased resistance to an antibiotic by about 100,000x. The researchers discovered that this allele differs from the normal variation of this allele by five point mutations. All five of these mutations must be done for the new allele to be highly resistant.

The paper explains that to reach these five mutations, there are 120 different pathways that could be reached. However, only certain orders increase the resistance and would benefit the bacterium.

Through models and experimentation, the researchers discovered that certain mutations either were deleterious or neutral, while others had limited fixation rates in the population. This means that through natural selection, only certain pathways toward the five mutations could be realized to become resistant.

The paper does not argue that proteins have limited paths to form. The paper only looks at one allele with multiple mutations required to reach it, and what pathways would be favorable or even plausible to make a population retain those steps before reaching the allele with high resistance.

The paper even concludes with this:

&gt; Our conclusion is also consistent with results from prospective experimental evolution studies, in which replicate evolutionary realizations have been observed to follow largely identical mutational trajectories. However, the retrospective, combinatorial strategy employed here substantially enriches our understanding of the process of molecular evolution because it enables us to characterize all mutational trajectories, including those with a vanishingly small probability of realization [which is otherwise impractical]. This is important because it draws attention to the mechanistic basis of selective inaccessibility. It now appears that intramolecular interactions render many mutational trajectories selectively inaccessible, which implies that replaying the protein tape of life might be surprisingly repetitive.

That is, because there are only a limited number of pathways, and those pathways require certain steps to be in place for the next mutation, we can repeat this process once the winning trajectories start to become fixated. We know that this happens not only from this paper but also from Lenski's E. coli experiment.

So this again puts to rest the need for a designer, and just shows that random mutation + natural selection can come to novel features given the proper pressures, attempts and time.",74,1579328271,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eqcv4q/umrh2_wants_some_help_understanding_the_paper/

Unfortunately, there are so many outright lies, misrepresentations, complete ignorance and other such fatal problems with the slides that they're only useful for how not to make any arguments for one side or against another.

**Slide 1** is just the title card.

**Slide 2** is the table of contents. It lists pages even though this is a slide show. Not that big of a deal.

**Slide 3** is the title card for the first section, ""Science.""

**Slide 4** is the PRATT about ""observational vs. historical science."" This is just one of Ken Ham's complete fabrications about how science fits into two categories, of which one is just unverifiable (you'll never guess which one evolution falls into!). But the worst part are the points for each side.

Observational includes ""Composed of empirical evidence,"" ""Can be independently verified"" and ""No initial assumptions."" The first and third don't fit into what would be considered observations in science. You can make observations without running an experiment. And you can make assumptions before observations as well.

For historical, we get the points ""Rests on (but not composed of) empirical evidence,"" ""Cannot be independently verified"" and ""Rests on initial assumptions / worldviews."" All of these are also incorrect, since processes that happened in the past can be measured via experiment, can be verified independently by others who try to replicate such experiments, and don't require any particular world views or need any more assumptions than testing a hypothesis.

So already we are on the first slide of claims and nearly every single one fails.

**Slide 5** are six ""things we know from operational science."" Yet all of these are part of evolutionary biology.

**Slide 6** asks the question, ""Does operational data translate into historical theories?"" with a question mark over two paths coming from ""Things we know: DNA, Proteins, Mutation, Natural Selection, Fossils, Genetics"" and going to either ""Evolution"" or ""Creation."" And that's it. The ""Science"" section makes no other case other than wrongly suggesting that there's two types of science, operational and historical.

&gt;The proof: Erosion rates are too fast to be consistent with an old earth.
There are 2,000 arches remaining in Arches National Park. They are collapsing at a rate of one per year. In 2,000 years they will all be gone. https://creation.com/age-of-arches

This argument makes two erroneous assumptions, first that all of the arches present were present at the moment of creation, and secondly that new arches are not being formed. 

The sandstone that makes up arches was burred deep underground 65 million years ago, wrinkled like a dirty shirt. Uplift and erosion recently exposed it to the surface. Today water and freeze thaw weathering are producing arches. 

&gt;The White Cliffs of Dover (deposited during the Cretaceous period) are eroding at a rate of 1 meter every 6 years. If the cliffs have been eroding at 1 meter every 6 years since the end of the Cretaceous, more than 10,000 km of coastline would have eroded away -- the distance from London to Cape Town, South Africa. England must have been HUGE back in the day. https://creation.com/vanishing-coastlines

Much like the previous argument, this argument erroneously assumes a constant rate of erosion. Poor beach management, increased storms, and acidification of the ocean has increased erosion in the last 150 years. According to [Science World Report](https://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/51981/20161110/historic-white-cliffs-dover-vanish-study-reveals.htm) the rate of erosion is 22 to 32cm per year.

&gt;""People speak about millions of years so easily. It rolls off the tongue. But when we think about what these unimaginable eons of time actually mean, we find they do not match what we observe. The erosion we see on the coastlines all over the world is not consistent with the idea of millions of years.""

I'm always curious what a YEC thinks the earth will look like in millions of years. 

The consistent assumption that deposition, mountain building, volcanism etc. do not occur today is tiresome.",28,1579235109,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epvcuz/more_arguments_to_debunk_from_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,epu40z,SaggysHealthAlt,Young Earth Creationist,t2_4h4ws52t,self.DebateEvolution,,A few questions on Abiogenesis from a Creationist recently receiving lots of attention.,"Hi r/debateevolution! It's about time I make my own post here. I've been receiving attention, usually negative attention, getting called over from my fortress at r/creation. What else could I expect from you guys when I post things like the 95 thesis against Evolution in my own subreddit completely minding my own business? Nevermind that, I got a few questions for you guys!

1. Abiogenesis is yet to be proven either naturally or expirementally. Based on the fossil record you guys interprete as evidence of Evolution of less complex forms to more complex, it can be assumed that as seculars you would find that  abiogenesis did occur regardless of what observable science has to say about it right now. Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occuring relies on *historical science*? 

2. If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

3. Let's say, if abiogenesis did occur naturally, how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

4. Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

5. Let's say that abiogenesis occured and it got food. How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

6. Let's say everything above was answered. Abiogenesis occured, it got it's food, it knew how to make another cell. Now how did this thing get a genome?

7. Ok, so it somehow, somewhere, from some place, the genome is now in this cell. Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

8. Let's say all problems above are solved. There are problems whatsoever. Now look out your window and see the trees, grass, people, life everywhere. The city, town, rural land around you.  Now ask yourself, do you actually believe you came from this thing?

I hope to get rational answers for my rational questions. You don't always get a Creationist leaving his fortress willing to see what no man's land has in store for him.",35,1579228860,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epu40z/a_few_questions_on_abiogenesis_from_a_creationist/

DebateEvolution,eo5aw2,ursisterstoy,Evolutionist,t2_ni1r89j,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The evidence for evolution from common ancestry is overwhelming.,"https://youtu.be/Jw0MLJJJbqc

Genetics, phylogenetics, homology, morphology, embryology, and every other line of evidence regarding the diversification of life paints the same picture. 

For an example we can compare humans to chimpanzees, because this is rather controversial for creationists.

Through genetics we have found that we share 98.4% coding gene similarity and by comparing the whole genome the similarity drops to around 96%. This includes genes located in the same location on the same chromosomes, the merger of chromosome 2A and 2B into a single chromosome in humans. Endogenous retroviruses in the same location. The same gene for producing vitamin C broke in the same way in the same location. It isn’t just enough to say there was a common designer when psueudogenes and viruses are found in both lineages in the same location. Also, the molecular clock based on average mutation rates and parsimony places the point of divergence to around six million years ago.

Shared homology shows that we have the same number of hair follicles, the same muscles attached to the same bones, humans having juvenile chimpanzee shaped skulls into adulthood, a fused tail bone in place of an actual tail, fingerprints, pectoral mammary glands - just two of them, we have the same organs with chimpanzee brains developing in the same way but halting earlier. We can both walk bipedally and also climb trees with our grasping hands. The males have reduced bones or no bones at all in their naked pendulous penises.  Also homology is more than just similar shaped body parts having the same name where arms being composed of one bone followed by two followed by small wrist bones followed by hand and finger bones and never in a different order because they are the same bones connected the same way and not just similar bones taking the same function. A non-homologous trait would be the different style wings of birds, bats, and pterosaurs as they have the same arms but different wings. The arms show common ancestry, the wings show convergent evolution. 

Morphology is related to homology but includes all features that look the same regardless of how they formed - showing that they evolved to fit the same function, with homology being the best type of morphology showing shared ancestry with other morphological traits showing shared environmental pressures. Both are consistent with common ancestry as the common ancestor would be from the same location being the same animal. 

Embryology is based on how organisms develop. Ontogeny takes this from zygote to adulthood. The closer related an organism is the more similar they are for longer throughput their ontogeny with the earliest stages of embryonic development showing how we are related to larger categories of organisms. The sperm cells being opisthokonts categorizes us with other opisthokonts like fungi. The development within amniotic fluid makes us a specific type of animal related to all living reptiles, birds, and mammals more closely than salamanders and living fish. The way our organs develop takes us through the phylogeny of our ancestry and by the time we arrive at the latest stages of development we are strikingly similar to the other great apes, especially chimpanzees based on brain development and other features that show common ancestry. 

The fossil record contains thousands of intermediate forms that match up strikingly well with the other lines of evidence providing us tangible evidence for common ancestry without genetics. Sahelanthropus, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and several intermediate forms within our own genus shows evolution occurring over time when we account for the ages of the fossils and the layers in which they are found - making geology another independent line of evidence for evolution over time when paleontology shows that these fossils are found to be in the expected age ranges and geographical locations that only make sense if there was actual evolution occurring over time and is incompatible with all of these intermediate forms existing at the same time.

And finally, phylogeny takes the evidence from all of these other fields. Simply feeding genetic data into a program that compares similarity produces the same phylogenetic relationships as morphology and embryology produce with few differences. When there are differences in phylogeny, it is genetics that takes precedence. 

Is there anything factual that can debunk common ancestry? If there is, it hasn’t been demonstrated. Creationists, the ball is in your court to support your alternative.",224,1578928115,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eo5aw2/the_evidence_for_evolution_from_common_ancestry/

DebateEvolution,entwuz,theHating,,t2_3ywzyhmj,self.DebateEvolution,,I AM NOT A CREATIONIST.,"I had to repost this here because apparently the moderators at r/evolution either dont know how to read or just like to pretend they know how to read.  In any event, they advised me to dump this gasoline tanker all over the creationism debate, enjoy.

To restate, my intention here, as laid out in the OP, is to refute the following two claims:

1. There exists something that can sensibly be called ""THE theory of evolution"", and

2. The theory of evolution ""fits all the facts""



Near the start of their seminal 1972 paper on punctuated equilibria, Niles Eldredge and co-author Stephen Jay Gould specify the position they are militating against: the traditional Darwin-based theory of slow, steady, adaptive evolution. They refer to it as ""phyletic gradualism"".

Gould and Eldredge identify the following four tenets of phyletic gradualism (and I quote):

(1) New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendents

(2) The transformation is even and slow

(3) The transformation involves large numbers, usually the entire ancestral population

(4) The transformation occurs over all or a large part of the ancestral species' geographical range


One of the testable implications of phyletic gradualism is (and I quote again):

""Ideally, the fossil record for the origin of a new species should consist of a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant""



Now, as some of you may have discovered yourselves, you can show a frothing Darwinian pretty much anything you like and still be told, ""That's perfectly in accordance with my theory. My theory fits all the facts  "".

On the other hand, both thoughtful Darwinians (including CD himself) and their opponents have been aware since the publication of 'Origin' that phyletic gradualism does not fit all the facts: The fossil record does not typically consist of ""a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant"".

Few are more keenly aware of this theoretical embarrassment than paleontologists such as Eldredge and Gould themselves.


Does this mean, then, that phyletic gradualism is falsified and must be abandoned? Well, loyal patrons of my ""Falsifiability"" thread will hopefully be aware by now that there is rarely, if ever, a definitive refutation in empirical science. If its defenders are stubborn -- and ingenuous! -- enough, a seemingly troubled theory can always be shielded from falsification by (say) appeal to unrecognized forces or hidden variables, by postulating an undiscovered planet or subatomic particle, or by conjuring up a cosmological constant (as Einstein did).

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range

In the context of human evolution, this makes perfect sense. We first appeared in East Africa, and as we radiated outwards we experienced serial founder events, reducing diversity in non-African populations. Further from Addis Ababa, less diversity. Exactly as expected.

But what's the creationist explanation for these data? How do these findings fit in that paradigm? I'm talking Young Earth, but you still run into just raw diversity problems if you start with a population of N=2, even in the Old Earth timeframe. So answers from either angle are appreciated.

I'm about half done the book and am enjoying it. While the topic of this subreddit hasn't reared its ugly head, she did mention creation.com, and Mike Pence being a YEC.

In the book she argues that scientific consensus is a very useful tool for determining if we can trust science.  She cited eugenics and continental drift as two areas of study that while commonly argued had arrived at consensus, there was no consensus. In the first point she argued that social scientists and some prominent geneticists were both opposed to eugenics, and while American geologists were largely opposed to continental drift, European geologists accepted it more readily, or at least refused to pass judgment. 

Oreskes suggests asking five questions when determine the validity of scientific consensus. 

1. Do the individual in the community bring to bear different perspectives? Do they represent a range of perspectives in terms of ideas, theoretical commitments, methodological preferences and personal value?

2. Have different methods been applied and diverse lines of evidence considered?

3. Has there been ample opportunity for dissenting views to be heard, considered, and weighted?

4. Is the community open to new information and able to be self-critical?

5. Is the community demographically diverse: in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, country of origin, and the like?

While I'm sure some creationists will object to 3 and 4, I think the answer when discussing evolution is a resounding yes.

/u/MRH2 posted these two ideas thinking that they logically cause problems with evolution. It's a safe bet that he just gets these ideas wrong, but let's still investigate his claims.

Claim #1:

""First, in terms of evolution and adaptation, I don't see how evolution can create **stable complex ecosystems.**"" (emphasis his).

He uses an example of the zebra, impala and lion.

&gt; There is a huge environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion.

No, no there's no environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion. Evolution doesn't work on what someone thinks should be the goal. If a trait forms that allows for the impala to run faster, then that trait likely will propagate to future generations because slower impala will be eaten. But there are other mechanisms which have developed to keep prey from being eaten, such as tougher armor, foul taste, etc. ""Be faster"" is just one trait that several species have evolved over time, and it benefited their populations so it propagated better to offspring over generations.

&gt; Now we've all seen evolution do amazing things, like evolve hearts and lungs, so making an impala be fast enough (or skillful enough) to avoid capture should not be too hard.

Impalas are fast, yes, but to argue that they should evolve to be fast enough to avoid capture and this being an easy evolution is again ignorant of how evolution works. Any advantage that evolves has a trade-off somewhere. Running faster may lead to limbs that are weaker for other things, or requiring more proteins to sustain, or so forth. So it's not just something that is ""easy"" but a matter of whether the advantage outweighs the negative for producing viable offspring. Also, once again, evolution doesn't work on goals. ""Being faster is good"" doesn't mean that species will just evolve methods to being faster. That's just not how it works.

&gt; Now the lion can also evolve. It loves to eat zebra which are not particularly fast. Again, it wouldn't take much, compared to the convergent evolution of echolocation, for evolution to make the lion slightly better at catching zebra.

Once again, we have someone ignorant of evolution arguing that something should be easy, or comparably easier, to evolve to do something. What if lions simply became scavengers? Or waited to trap zebras? There's no goal to evolution, so whatever advantage outweighs the negatives wins out.

&gt; So the lions then eats all the zebra. All zebra are now gone. It can't catch the implala so then it starves. All lion are now gone. All we have are impala.

A very simplistic thought idea, but if the zebra can't reproduce enough to sustain their population, then yes, they will go extinct. But before this happens, there will be fewer lions to feast on them because there will be less food to feed the lions, if all they got to feast on were zebra. So there would be an equilibrium that would form before either were to be wiped out, and something else would need to affect one of their populations to push them over the edge to extinction.

&gt; The point of this is that it's very easy for minor changes to disrupt complex ecosystems and result in very simple ones.

Somehow this ""complex ecosystem"" consisting of one predator and two prey species collapses with a simple change, that is, lions overeating the only one of the two prey they could catch. That's not very complex and it's a bad argument to make.

Claim #2:

""Secondly, this [post] led me to consider DNA's error checking and repair mechanisms.""

Oh, boy... And the [post] does not link anywhere as of the time of posting this.

&gt; How is it, that evolution which depends on random mutations, would evolve mechanisms that try to prevent any mutations from occurring at all?

Because too many errors would be a huge issue for a system which requires replication? However, nothing is perfect, and for humans, even with billions of base pairs in a single genome, over 100 errors get through when forming gametes. Imagine if there was no system of correction how bad that would get?

&gt; The theory of evolution cannot exist without mutations driving change, so why and how would random mutations end up creating complex nanomachines that try to eliminate all mutations.

The ""why"" assumes there's a purpose to it rather than chemistry being chemistry. And just because something tries to do something doesn't mean it will always succeed at it. A working, replicating living cell would continue living if it kept replicating perfectly, as long as it did not need to adapt to any environment. But chemistry doesn't always work the exact way every time (due to external forces interacting with chemical reactions) so sometimes errors creep in. Now we have variations in those organisms. Some bad. Some good. Most do nothing toward the fitness of the organism.

&gt; This doesn't make sense to me.

Perhaps because you refuse to learn about evolution from reputable sources and keep insisting creationism must be true?",116,1578456248,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elncx1/rcreation_two_logical_issues_with_evolution_or/

What could explain his results?,"Mark Armitage has claimed he has found further evidence of the young age of dinosaur fossils.

&gt;Armitage starts showing several structures that he interprets as axons. Scientists who are committed to these fossils being millions of years old dismiss such structures as remnants of fungi that have contaminated the fossil. However, fungal remnants have specific characteristics, and Armitage does tests to show that the structures he interprets as axons don’t have those characteristics. Instead, they have the characteristics expected of axons! Indeed, he shows images from another scientist that demonstrate how axons from a mouse behave under specific conditions, and then he shows that one of the structures he interprets as an axon from a dinosaur behaves in a similar way.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most stunning image in the video is the one I show at the top of this article. The image shows what appears to be the sections of myelin that wrap an axon as well as the nodes of Ranvier that exist in between those sections. The arrows point out where the myelin wrappings end and the nodes of Ranvier begin. If these results are confirmed, they represent the first time anyone has isolated soft axons from a dinosaur fossil! Based on what I have seen, I think Armitage makes a very strong case, so I expect the results to be confirmed.

What could possibly explain this?

DebateEvolution,elfw8g,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"RE: Pseudogenes, this WILL come up, so let's get it out of the way now, because it doesn't say what creationists will claim it says.","New commentary in Nature.

(Don't get me started on Nature. Suffice it to say you should always double check work published there. But this isn't experimental work, it's a ""perspective"", so that caveat doesn't apply.)

&amp;nbsp;

If I were a betting man, I'd say that within a day or two, we're going to see a creationist post something along the lines of ""more biologists acknowledging creationist prediction of functional pseudogenes is accurate"", using this paper as proof.

And when that happens, invite said creationist to chill and read what those authors are saying. 

They are *not* saying ""junk DNA"" doesn't exist. 

They are *not* saying all, or even most, DNA is functional.

They are *not* saying pseudogenes (sequences derived from previously protein-coding regions that are no longer protein-coding) don't exist. 

&amp;nbsp;

They *are* saying that the term ""pseudogene"" is applied to broadly during genome annotation, without sufficient experimental support, and should be applied much more narrowly. Specifically, for regions derived from fully functional (i.e. transcribed, translated, and active) genes:

Retro-transposed coding regions and truncated coding regions, if translated, should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. (I think these should just be called ""genes"". That's the word for a transcribed and translated region of DNA. Pretty simple.)

Transcribed but non-translated regions should not be classified as pseudogenes by default, and should be evaluated on the basis of the activity of the resulting RNA - some have a regulatory function. (Although I think they go too far in the other direction here, and that non-translated RNAs should be in the ""maybe functional, maybe not"" box until each one is specifically checked experimentally.)

Non-transcribed regions that affect chromatin packaging should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. The authors describe how some may be involved in gene regulation via chromatin remodeling. (I think they also go a bit far here, and this affect on chromatin is basically incidental, and that the nearby genes have basically evolved around their genomic neighbors. So remove or modify the neighbors, and the regulation of the genes themselves are messed up. But that doesn't make the neighboring regions ""functional"".)

And finally, they describe two sets of things that can happen to pseudogenes which causes them to be associated with disease: recombination and copy-number variation. I think this is the weakest evidence for functions of the pseudogene regions. Basically, they aren't doing much until there is too much or it's in the wrong place. That's not showing they're functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I have my quibbles with some of what the authors say, but overall I think they make a reasonable point: The term ""pseudogene"" has been applied too widely, to most gene-derived sequences that don't do ""everything"" a gene does (and in some cases, to sequences that *do* do all of those thing, i.e. are genes in the traditional sense), even though at least some of these sequences are probably functional (i.e. contribute affirmatively to cell physiology). 

So be skeptical when you see creationists try to twist this paper to say something it doesn't. 

Or when they do, remind them that pseudogenes are about 1.2% of the human genome, so if *every single one* was functional, that would inch the needle up to about 11% functionality in the human genome. A far cry from ""at least 80% of the genome is functional"" or whatever insane number they use now.",7,1578423478,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elfw8g/re_pseudogenes_this_will_come_up_so_lets_get_it/

Just wanted to get thoughts on how a creationist might respond to those arguments and any criticisms or suggestions DE frequenters would have. 

Arguments:

We have very strong evidence for common descent in recent animals (microevolution acc. to many creationists). A portion of this evidence is weaker, but contributes to and is present among the whole of the evidence. This weaker evidence is present for extinct animals which may have much further removed proposed evolutionary relationships (macroevolution acc. to those same creationists). Our observations supported by strong evidence justify that this weaker evidence indicates evolution, while we have no evidence that it indicates anything creationist models propose. This counts in favor of evolution as the better explanation for all the weaker evidence we see. 

A wide variety of geological and physical processes we observe today are gradual processes that would take many thousands to millions of years to result in earth as we see today. If a young earth or a flood model were to account for these features, it would require a large number of significant coincidences to account for all of these processes at once. Our models which require fewer coincidences, all else equal, are better than models that require more. This counts in favor of old earth and non-flood models of geology as better than young earth and flood models of geology. 

Barimonology can only be a successful model of phylogeny for creationists if humans and primates are separate barims. Any methodology used to identify barims will: include expected and strongly evidenced clades, but include humans as primates; or separate humans and primates, but also separate expected and strongly evidenced clades as separate barims. There are no other successful models of phylogeny for creationists. For universal common descent, however, there are successful models of phylogeny. The best explanations for our observations, all else equal, will be successful models. This counts in favor of universal common descent as a better model of phylogeny than any creationist account. 

How might you expect a creationist respond to these? 

Any questions about the arguments? 

Any criticisms of the arguments? 

Any suggestions for the arguments?

Probably more important, what are some empirical sources I can use to verify some of the premises I'm defending?  It wouldn't be too hard to resort to waffling around the issues addressed if there are no hard obstacles presented.  In particular, I think examples of very clearly related animals alive today (elephants is an example I've seen before) would be very valuable for the explanation of weak evidence and problems with barimonology.  I especially need fossil evidence and the methodology used for recent evolutionary lines we have good accounts of, as this would allow comparison with more ancient evolution (although I expect this could be hard to find).",8,1578373530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/el6q33/developing_arguments_against_creation_model/

[This page (scroll down)](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions) by u/johnberea is an example. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9per4c/what_are_some_papers_you_can_site_showing_the/e87473w/) with u/br56u7, who is a YEC, is another. Thus John does a back-of-a-fag-packet calculation to conclude that if humans were created six million years ago, a diploid genome should have degraded from 100% to 88% functional.

A rather fun counter-argument to this is that plenty of intuitive ""kinds"" have a fantastically long existence in the fossil record without seeming to suffer any appreciable consequence of this phenomenon.

Crocodilians and Crocodyliformes have existed continuously since at least the late Cretaceous and early Jurassic, respectively. Take [this beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus) for instance.

Let’s give it 120 million years.

The relevant parametres are similar to those of humans. Neutral substitution rate of [7.9 x 10^(-9) per site per generation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386873/). Genome size of 2-3 gigabases. Generation time around 20 years. So extrapolating a 12% loss every 6 million years to 120 million years gives me 0.88^20=0.078 functional or a loss of 92.2% of the original function of the genome.

Unless I’m missing something, by u/johnberea’s calculations crocodiles are seriously fucked. Except that [they’re very much still around](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/45433088/3010181).

DebateEvolution,ek7oot,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"A question for the creationists, hopefully leading to nice chill discussion for a change.","I have a few questions for creationists about the life of plants and the great flood.  This is a question for creationists who believe in both the global flood, and micro evolution is the only form of evolution. This is clearly not trying to be too serious a conversation, yet I would like to take is seriously enough to avoid answering the questions by ‘magic’.


Before I ask the question, we have to agree on a few things:

1.	Flood waters would be brackish due to the salinity of the ocean. This would result in a large change to soil chemistry.


2.	Aquatic plants and terrestrial plants are of different kinds as they live in very different environments. Following this logic plants that can survive in saline rich vs non saline rich soil are different kinds. (As I’ve never read a concrete definition of a kind, these are the kinds for this conversation). 


3. To the best of my knowledge, terrestrial plants are unable to survive for 40 days under brackish water (this is a testable hypothesis, I’d love to be shown I’m wrong). Therefore, during the flood all of the terrestrial plants would have likely perished.

4. When the flood waters receded, soil chemistry would have been altered due to being covered with brackish (or straight saline water) water.

5. Aquatic plants didn’t recolonize the land, see point 2.



The Noah’s Ark story makes a big deal about Noah and his family gathering up two animals of every kind for the ark. I’ll admit I’m far from an expert on the story, but I’ve never heard of Noah et al. gathering up every kind of terrestrial (and some aquatic plants depends on the chemistry of the flood waters). But because I want to have good faith conversation I’ll be generous and extend an olive branch and allow Noah to have a massive seed stock of all of the plants on earth. With that said his seed stock would be useless due to changes in soil chemistry (Points 1 and 2).



So my questions are as follows. 

1. If God repopulated the earth with similar plants, (that were magically able to live in saline rich soil) where did our plants that live in non-saline rich soil come from?  

2. How did Noah’s small family desalinate the ground rapidly enough to feed not only themselves, but all of the animals on the Ark. What methods did they use to desalinate the grounds using the very limited technology available at the time, how did the cover the entire earth?  We should see a small break in the fossil record on remote areas of land and isolated regions.

3. If God magically pulled all of the salt out of the ground and repopulated the entire earth with plants, why did he require a 600 year old man undergo the arduous task of building an ark and gathering up the animals when he could have simply repopulating the earth with animals? Clearly God was interested in saving Noah, not the animals as he let nearly every animal die and there were no specific instructions about 'moral' animals.

Be kind to one another, as long as people are here in good faith be reasonable with your down votes.

But Creationists use genetic similarity as evidence for Common Design. Okay, it fits with their narrative but that being said we have actual, actionable evidence that common DNA=common descent. Even if it were evidence of common design, common descent should take priority as an explanation shouldnt it (in the same way thst a person could slip and fall on a knife, but if a bloodstained guy is nearby trying to escape its probably murder)

DebateEvolution,eisps0,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Vivek_david_law says that I lied about Hells Creek being non-marine.,"I’m disappointed you didn’t tag me so I can defend my post vivek_david_law.

[You called me a liar](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eirg13/dishonesty_of_debateevolution_hells_creek_marine/) when I made the case that Hell Creek is a non-marine deposit.  I’m once again forced to return to the discussion. 

Excuse the large amounts of quotes. I’m letting the [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation) page and this [New Yorker]( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) article that Vivek linked to speak for themselves. I'm really not interested in revisiting this topic, but I won't stand idly by when called a liar.

I included links to both articles I’ve copied quotes from so you can ensure I’m not quote mining.

Vivek_david_law:

&gt;So what was found in hells creek? Was it animals from rivers with brackish waters overflowing. Well a quick glance at the hells creek Wikipedia page says that along with fish, they also found sharks, octopuses, sea turtles and marine retitles like the mosasaur. So quick question for r/debateevolution - do sea turtles live in rivers or do they live in the ocean? Do we expect sea turtles from flooding rivers with brackish waters - or would that be consistent with a flood?


Why go to the Wikipedia page when I cited my data from a peer reviewed paper?  But I’ll indulge you, here are some other quotes from the Wikipedia page.

&gt;[Hell’s Creek] is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited…

&gt;The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the Fort Peck area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat, forested floodplainwith a relatively subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to conifers such as the bald cypress, ferns and ginkgos. The Hell Creek Formation was laid down by streams, on a coastal plain along the edge of the Western Interior Seaway. The presence of crocodilia suggests climate was subtropical; there was no cold season and probably ample precipitation.

&gt;At the time, this region had a subtropical, warm and moist climate. The climate was humid, with flowering plants, conifers, palmettos, and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, canopy, understory plants, ash trees, live oak and shrubs in the forests. In northwestern South Dakota, strips of black layers deposited in the wetland environment are rich in coal, and a bright band-like layer of sand and mud from the river floodplain accumulated.

&gt;A broad coastal plain extended westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone which have been attributed to floodplain, fluvial, lacustrine, swamp, estuarine and coastal plainenvironments.


This is exactly what I said, there were forests, and river near an inland sea. Some how you missed all of this while reading the wiki article.

Next you cited an article in the New Yorker. In the interest of fairness I’ll only quote from sources you provided. 

&gt;At the time of the [Chicxulub impact event], the Hell Creek landscape consisted of steamy, subtropical lowlands and floodplains along the shores of an inland sea. The land teemed with life and the conditions were excellent for fossilization, with seasonal floods and meandering rivers that rapidly buried dead animals and plants.

&gt;One paleontologist estimated that in the Cretaceous period Hell Creek was so thick with T. rexes that they were like hyenas on the Serengeti. It was also home to triceratops and duckbills.

Last I checked T-Rexes are terrestrial dinosaurs. 

&gt;In 2004, DePalma, at the time a twenty-two-year-old paleontology undergraduate, began excavating a small site in the Hell Creek Formation. The site had once been a pond, and the deposit consisted of very thin layers of sediment. Normally, one geological layer might represent thousands or millions of years. But DePalma was able to show that each layer in the deposit had been laid down in a single big rainstorm. “We could see when there were buds on the trees,” he told me. “We could see when the cypresses were dropping their needles in the fall. We could experience this in real time.” 




You linked to the article to support the following argument:

&gt;I'm not the only one surprised by salt and freshwater species with land mammals being found at hells creek. While r/DebateEvolution pretends this is normal and unquestioned, here is a non-creation scientist saying that they are perplexed by the finding in the New Yorker


The New Yorker article explains your findings in the following paragraph:

&gt;“When I saw that, I knew this wasn’t just any flood deposit,” DePalma said. “We weren’t just near the KT boundary—this whole site is the KT boundary!” From surveying and mapping the layers, DePalma hypothesized that a massive inland surge of water flooded a river valley and filled the low-lying area where we now stood, perhaps as a result of the KT-impact tsunami, 


There are many more quotes I can take from the article that discuss a non-marine environment, but I think I’ve argued my case.

Finally you linked to an article that discusses a tsunami at the KT boundary. This was already discussed above so I see no need to expand on my argument. 

The Wikipedia page states that deposition of the Hells Creek Formation took 2 million years. This two million years included a tsunami caused by the Chicxulub impact event. This tsunami mixed up terrestrial and marine organism. 

That does NOT mean that is was a non-marine environment for long periods of time. The ample amount of non-marine fossils speak for themselves.",70,1577936318,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eisps0/vivek_david_law_says_that_i_lied_about_hells/

DebateEvolution,eh4ytp,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"The issue isn't science it's philosophy! Okay, u/vivek_david_law, philosophise me this one.","&gt;What I realized from reading the posts, and from reading a lot of the posts on r/debateevolution is the problem for YEC is not a scientific conundrum. 

&gt;...

&gt;We don't even apply philosophy to basic philosophical questions, we think it's a waste of time.

&gt;This is a new modern development, and I think it's the source of this apparent science Young Earth conflict.

This is an amazing claim made on r/creation by u/vivek_david_law.

Unsurprisingly, the rest of his post is full of some quite extraordinary generalities (""often rejected by scientists"", that kind of thing), so let's get down to one very specific empirical case.

I'm going to return to u/denisova's chart, expanded with other measurements from the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary.

25 different analyses using three different isotopes with different halflives, from several locations and performed independently by several laboratories, wouldn't have been in agreement if there had been something fundamentally wrong with radiodating. If they were off by say, five orders of magnitude, as YECs believe. Of if, as you yourself said, we're (incorrectly) assuming ""that we know the way radioactive isotopes form and dissipate over long periods of time"".

This is a simple empirical test of the two theories, Old Earth vs Young Earth. The only assumption it makes is that a theory with predictive power (Old Earth: these methods should agree) is superior to a theory without predictive power (Young Earth: there is no intrinsic reason why these methods should agree).

So, u/vivek_david_law, if you think the empirical science isn't the issue and it's all about philosophy, **please give me a philosophical YEC interpretation of the same data.** I'm all ears.

Please don't downvote answers people.

I don't recall every seeing this before, so let's do it. I'm not going to comprehensively address each item, but I will group them thematically. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#1 is just 0_o...change in allele frequencies is the literal definition of evolution. We can observe this happening. Therefore evolution happens. There's a phrase: ""Microevolution"" is the evolution creationists can't deny, ""macroevolution"" is the evolution creationists must deny."" This is the former, so they go on to say ""but this isn't *really* evolution."" &lt;shruggie&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

\#2 is literally something I teach in the ""common misconceptions"" section of my 200-level evolution class.

&amp;nbsp;

\#3-5 and 7-11 are strawmen. Nobody says any of those things ""prove"" evolution. They are *examples* of evolutionary change, and *evidence* for evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#6 The scientific consensus *is* that evolution is true, but nobody says ""there's consensus, *therefore* evolution is true."" The causality goes the other way. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#12 and \#19-20 go together. Depending on how you make a design argument, it's either unfalsifiable, or false. ""Bad design"" doesn't really come into it, except to undermine some of the clumsily-stated falsifiable versions. It's often framed in religious, rather than scientific terms, and the modern, US-based ID movement, in addition to generally promoting an unfalsifiable idea of biological design, is an explicitly religious movement. Which has no bearing on the validity of the underlying idea, but turned out to be a liability in court. All of this is irrelevant to the validity of evolutionary theory, since disproving one idea does not automatically validate a competing idea. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#13: Biogeography *does* support evolution. It's *what led to evolutionary theory*. Both Darwin and Wallace were primarily engaged in biogeography, and Wallace is considered the father of the field.

&amp;nbsp;

\#14: Abiogenesis is a separate theory, and falling back to ""but evolution doesn't explain the origins of life!"" is a goal-post move. That being said, there's a robust and ever-growing body of evidence for abiogenesis, so biologists shouldn't shy away from the topic when it comes up. If creationists want to die on that hill instead of evolution, fine with me. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#15-18 are things nobody uses to defend evolutionary theory, and I'm reasonably confident these aren't real arguments scientists make. I'd be more confidence, but I can't read literally every argument anyone ever makes on these issues, so I can't be sure. I haven't personally encountered them. They range from unreasonable to laughable. Has the author of this piece ever, I don't know, *asked biologist what the arguments for evolution are*? Or are they just making things up?

&amp;nbsp;

\#21 is irrelevant to the question of the validity of evolutionary theory.

If I wanted to know what happened to them I could simply ask him when I arrived in heaven. I was taught nothing could have lived 65 million years ago because God created all land animals and man on the 6th day of creation. I remember being taught in the 3rd grade that the Earth and universe were both 6,000 years old. This timeline was established in 1650 CE by James Ussher, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh. He studied the Bible and tracked back the time and date of creation to be approximately 6 pm on October 22, 4004 BCE. In a small classroom in 1997 my young mind was being taught the same thing and I believed it. I had no reason to doubt it, after all, I was in school and this was an adult telling me this. I was never taught about the alternative theories. Anytime I would hear anything remotely contradicting the ""Young Earth"" belief I would do as I was told: ignore it.

&amp;nbsp;
You may want to re-read that sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;
I think the debate of TOBE is very [salubrious](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/salubrious). The essence of scientific inquiry is to establish a cause for a given affect.

&amp;nbsp;
When I use the phrase, ""present-day complex bodies,"" that is ***exactly*** the affect (result) that TOBE requires.  ***That's*** not negotiable. The only uncertainty is to the precise complexity. The contemporary discoveries about the human genome, for example, are a genuine examples of complexity. What's preposterous to me is that ""genetic mutation"", ***random or otherwise*** is the mechanism of change that explains the vast physical transformation from a simplistic organism into a present-day complex organism.

&amp;nbsp;
Please note that ""random or otherwise"" means that ***that*** point can be set aside while there's discussion of ""genetic mutation,"" the change mechanism. Natural selection--I've been silent about that, so far--is the ***other*** main tenet, it not being a ""mechanism."" In this sense, natural selection is of the same type of effect as Gravity; and, as we know , [""Gravity always wins""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yw6NKIczZg)",47,1577029235,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ee67bk/on_the_importance_of_debate_over_our_subject/
DebateEvolution,ee2o1i,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Evolution isn’t real, unless it’s decades-scale hyper-evolution on steroids... some specific examples from the historical record.","Today’s “kinds”, in the YEC view, descend from a single couple on the ark (ca. 2300 BCE), which evolved into the many different species we see today, over the course of four thousand years.

Enter, however, a lovely little thing called the historical record, which seriously fucks with this theory.

The fact that modern animals are frequently attested, as far as records go (which is pretty much right up to the Tower of Babel, about a century post-flood, if you’re a YEC), with *the physical and behavioral characteristics of modern animals*, is strong evidence against this YEC model.

This post gives some specific examples of where the historical and archaeological record further constrains already implausible YEC micro-evolution narrative. I’m putting it here for reference. It shows that creationists have, at best, a century or two to play with for many of the kinds they postulate.

(Note: creationists can’t agree on their own bullshit revisionist timelines, so I usually haven’t tried to translate real dates into YEC dates. But these would all have to be a matter of a few centuries at most.)

**Evidence for divergence of the cat kind**

All [one species on the ark](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/), around 2300 BCE. Yet we find, among many other things...

- An extremely clear picture of a lion from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, conventionally around 2550 BCE (figure 8 [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/artifacts-royal-cemetery-of-ur-171678)).

- Pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egyptian tombs containing remains of both wild cats and leopards. See [here](https://www.thegreatcat.org/cat-domestication-continued-the-mostagedda-tomb-hierakonpolis/), [here](https://archive.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html) and [here](http://www.hierakonpolis-online.org/index.php/explore-the-predynastic-cemeteries/hk6-elite-cemetery).

- A Proto-Sumerian (conventionally 3000 BCE) [depiction of a leopard](https://phoenixancientart.com/work-of-art/mesopotamian-statuette-of-a-leopard/)

So that’s a conventional 15.2 million years (lion/domestic cat on timetree.org) compressed into a few centuries max.

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the sheep kind**

- Ancient Sumerian texts from third millennium B.C.E. [distinguish between sheep and goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_between_sheep_and_grain).

- [Summary of early attestation of goats](https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/goats-in-the-ancient-near-east-and-their-relationship-with-the-mythology-fairytale-and-folklore-of-t).

- Extensive [archaeological evidence](https://www.academia.edu/2590017/Sheep-_and_-Goats-Mesopotamia-domestication-_and_-secondary-products) for sheep and goats, stretching deep into prehistory.

- The Proto-Indo-European lexemes for [sheep](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%82%C3%B3wis) and [goat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0u%C7%B5-) are reconstructible, requiring these animals to have existed when PIE was spoken. Creationists tend to assume PIE was spoken immediately after the Tower of Babel, which would give just over a century for the divergence.

Instead of 9.75 million years (sheep/goat on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for equid divergence **

- An 18th century BCE text distinguishing between [horse and mule](http://imh.org/exhibits/online/legacy-of-the-horse/riding-comes-near-east-1350-bce/).

- The notion of the donkey as stubborn (inaccurate, but the stereotype is based on actual behaviour traits of this equid which *differ* from horse traits) dates back at least to Sumerian [texts from 2100-1800 B.C.E.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/598273.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A63fea475e6409e83e7bb2eb0e5c5ceb4)

- Donkey remains from [early dynastic Egypt](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3715).

Particularly interesting is the fact that mules (horse-donkey hybrids) have been infertile since as far as our historical records go. Even where it is not otherwise stated it can be inferred from their market value, as outlined [here](https://books.google.be/books?id=vUIoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Sumerian+price+of+mule&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHWaex_zy1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CQj8yxR88OiaJjetrB-PapKOBLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZx86IlK_mAhWvxoUKHR90DQMQ6AEwDnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20price%20of%20mule&amp;f=false); the fact that mules were so expensive is reflective of the fact that they could not simply be bred.

This is further significant in that deliberately breeding hybrids suggests some experience in equid domestication. By any reasonable scenario, therefore, this pushes horse-onager and horse-donkey divergence even further back. We're presumably playing with decades here. Instead of a conventional 7.7 million years (horse/donkey on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the eagle kind**.

[“Includes hawks, but also kites, harriers, eagles, and Old World vultures.”]( https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-of-avian-ark-kinds/)

- Ancient Sumerians [depicted the eagle](https://books.google.be/books?id=aH-Aq6oF5uoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=eagle+sumeria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xLon2oQ9Gq&amp;sig=ACfU3U1P398gVF7eefpMvqx1Qbk_4wey7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8nc-LnK_mAhXCxYUKHXKlDNMQ6AEwFnoECA4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eagle%20sumeria&amp;f=false).

- The identification of black kites from the [Egyptian fifth dynasty](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40345840?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) is based on their behaviour as well as their appearance.

- Extremely clear depiction of the [Egyptian vulture from 2600 BCE](https://www.lifegyptianvulture.it/en/the-egyptian-vulture/).

That makes, again, a few centuries max instead of conventional 31 million years (eagle/kite on timetree.org). 

-----

On a side note, I must say I never realised just *how* brazenly amateurish baraminology was:

&gt;When hybrid data is lacking, a cognitum approach is preferred; this identifies natural groupings based on human cognitive senses

So a smart creationist might try to rescue the creationist view by saying they’ve just messed up the kinds and those kinds are actually multiple kinds.

But then again, on the flip side of the coin, you have to fit all these animals onto a wooden ship that’s already too big to be seaworthy as described in the Bible.

&gt;In any time of war or danger, the old saying, '*There are no atheists in foxholes*,' rings true. No matter how steely the mind, or the conviction of skepticism, in a crisis, humans revert to the default position:

He goes on to tell an anecdote and then admit that he has no data to support this hypothesis.

However, what I think is interesting is how he does not see a natural explanation, and so it must be a primal instinct. I don't know if it would take that long to show how adaptive that is. I mean, if someone is in danger, it is adaptive to believe that they are saved, or something.

Gunter Bechly 

&gt; I see neither any scientific nor compelling other reasons to dispute the conventional dating of the age of the universe and Earth, or the conventional explanations for the origin of the geological column and the fossil record. I also consider so-called Flood Geology of Young Earth Creationists as a totally failed endeavor.

https://www.bechly.at/anti-darwinism-1/

Michael Behe

&gt; Although in Darwin’s Black Box, Behe confessed that he had “no reason to doubt that the universe is billions of years old,” and that he had “no particular reason to doubt” common descent (p. 5), such comments were few and far between. Some Bible-believing scientists, trying to give Behe the benefit of the doubt, speculated that, perhaps such “brief, sporadic comments...were intended to make the book more marketable” (see Major, 1996). (It was, after all, made available by a major publishing company—Simon &amp; Schuster.) What’s more, “Behe’s arguments stand without any reference to the age issue” (Major).

&gt; Christians have much less about which to be excited in Behe’s latest book, The Edge of Evolution. Sadly, it is riddled with unscriptural, unprovable, even irreverent statements. First, Behe repeatedly gives credence to the evolutionary geologic timetable. He writes about fish that he believes have been around for “ten million years” (2007, p. 16), and how “perhaps a trillion creatures have preceded us [humans—EL] in the past ten million years” (p. 60). Behe even goes so far as to suggest that life has been on Earth for “the past several billion years” (p. 19). The fact is, Behe’s thoughts contradict holy writ: God created “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” in six days (Exodus 20:11)—thousands, not billions, of years ago (cf. Mark 10:6; Luke 11:49-51; Romans 1:20; see also Lyons, 2006).

Any thoughts? 

&gt; This analysis of de novo origination in the genus Oryza detected critical evidence in both ancestral non-coding origination and 
translational products of de novo genes. We identified at least 175 candidate de novo genes with significantly similar ancestral non-coding sequences, implicating an unexpectedly high rate 
(51.5 de novo genes per Myr) of generation and retention of de novo genes in the genomes of young Oryza species compared with reported lower numbers of de novo genes in metazoans1,2,16–29 and 
plants12–15. These observations show that de novo genes are important in the evolution of protein diversity in Oryza. These data reveal the power of evolution in natural populations in the generation 
of de novo genes that arise from non-coding sequences, probably via various possible molecular processes over time54,68, compared with artificial synthesis and selection69,70. We also note that the observed high rate of de novo gene generation and retention in the recent evolution of Oryza might have been in equilibrium with the loss of unrelated genes in genome evolution, as was previously detected in cereal species33. We anticipate that, whether or not such dynamics of gene evolution can be extrapolated beyond the Oryza genus backwards to farther ancestral lineages of Poaceae, monocots and angiosperms will be an important problem to explore in the future.

It's so weird how creationists keep harping on Haeckel's fraudulent embryos as if it presents a formidable challenge to the theory of evolution. Please, enough. Every single biologist worth their weight in salt recognizes this fraud. Even if ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" was a hypothesis worth investigating, Haeckel forged many of his drawings.

Research on embryology into the early twentieth century delved deeper into development, and the boom of molecular biology was so loud that many textbooks just didn't remove this flaw (i.e. Homeobox genes, ""hedgehog"" genes, etc.). But the fact that it is wrong does not discount the interpretation of embryological development through the lens of evolutionary history.

Human embryos have pharyngeal gill slits (like all **chordates**\--cladistic term--have at some point in their life cycle). Duh. That's telling of human evolutionary history. But the theory doesn't always hold. There is no bacterial stage in the development of the zygote. There. An ""evolutionist"" has admitted that ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny. Done.

And of course, /u/PaulDouglasPrice lies through his teeth.

&gt;So this is more or less a question for anybody who happens to work in (or is familiar with) the field of genetics in any capacity:

Then don't try a closed creationist subreddit.

&gt;Are you aware of any discussion going on behind the scenes about genetic entropy? Is there any frank discussion going on, say, in population genetics, for example, about how all the published models of mutation effects predict decline? That there is no biologically realistic simulation or model that would actually predict an overall increase in fitness over time?

None of this is true.

&gt;What about the fact that John Sanford helped create the most biologically-realistic model of evolution ever, Mendel's Accountant? And of course, this program shows clearly that decline happens over time when you put in the realistic parameters of life.

Mendel's Accountant is frighteningly flawed, but of course, PDP is completely unqualified to recognize that.

Did you know that there are *no* values that you can put into Mendel's Accountant which is stable? You can make positive mutations exceedingly common and the population's fitness still collapses.

This suggests something is **very wrong** with his simulation.

&gt;Darwinian evolution is fundamentally broken at the genetic level. The math obviously doesn't work, so how do the researchers manage to keep a straight face while still paying lip service to Darwin?

Because saying it is a lot different than proving it, you still have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;According to Sanford's own testimony on the matter, his findings have been met with nothing but silence from the genetics community (a community of which Sanford himself is an illustrious member, having achieved high honors and distinguished himself as an inventor). He believes they are actively attempting to avoid this issue entirely because they know it is so problematic for them.

Yes, because Sanford is completely discredited. His entire theory is nonsense.",98,1576518433,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ebif5i/pdp_asks_unqualified_laymen_is_genetic_entropy/

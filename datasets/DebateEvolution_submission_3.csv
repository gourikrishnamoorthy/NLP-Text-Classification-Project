This is building off of some recent discussions related to “genetic entropy”. Before we get too far, some terms need defining, so we’re all on the same page. 

*Some* creationists might disagree with some of these definitions. Tough luck. These are the biological definitions, not the creationist versions. 

Mutation: Any change to the base sequence of a DNA molecule.

Neutral: Does not affect fitness.

Deleterious: Hurts fitness

Beneficial: Helps fitness

Fitness: Reproductive success.

Got it? Great. Let’s do this.

&amp;nbsp;

**Section 1. Equilibrium**

The first thing we need to cover is perhaps a bit counterintuitive, but extremely important: There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur. 

There are two main reasons for this.

The first is very simple: Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations. Consider a single base, which can exist in state a or a’, where a’ represents a mutation. Once that mutation occurs, a --&gt; a’ is no longer possible, but a’ --&gt; a has become possible. If there is a fitness effect to the original mutation (i.e. it is not neutral), its occurrence changes the distribution of fitness effects going forward. 

So why does this matter? Consider a larger but still extremely oversimplified scenario. Ten bases. Each one has three potential mutations (because there are four possible bases at each site, and each site can only be one at a time). Let’s say for each of these ten sites, one of the possible mutations is beneficial, and the other two are equally deleterious, and all are equally likely. 

So at the start, the ratio of possible beneficial mutations to deleterious is 1:2, and assuming they’re all equally likely, we’d expect deleterious mutations to occur at about twice the rate as beneficial. Right?

Wrong.

Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we *also* remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s *2* beneficial and 1 *neutral*. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.

after 2: 12/2/16.

after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)

One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial. 

Now, that’s pretty unrealistic; beneficial mutations are quite rare. 

So let’s remove them. Now consider each site with 1 neutral and 2 deleterious mutations possible.

After 1 mutation, we go from 0/10/20 to 2/10/18 (because the original neutral mutation became beneficial relative to the new genotype, the deleterious mutation that occurred is off the table, the other becomes neutral, relative to the one that occurred, and the back mutation is beneficial.)

So keep that going:

2 mutations: 4/10/16

3 mutations: 6/10/14. Majority not deleterious. 

At 5 mutations, it becomes 10/10/10. 

[Figure 1.]( https://i.imgur.com/3TMbDY6.png
)

First two scenarios graphed. X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is number of possible mutations. Red line is deleterious mutations, blue is beneficial in first scenario, green is beneficial in second. 

&amp;nbsp;

You can play with these number however you want. Genome size, percentage of bases that are selectable, frequency of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious. As long as you permit neutral mutations, you’ll always hit an equilibrium point at some number of deleterious mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

In fact, let’s model that more specifically. 

Let’s say, what, 99% of mutations are deleterious, and only 0.1% are beneficial. And also that there is zero selection. Is that sufficiently pessimistic for creationists? And let’s work with 1000 sites.

So the expected ratio at the start, in percentages, would be 0.1/0.9/99 b/n/d. 

But as deleterious mutations accumulate, the ratio changes, just like the simple examples above. Where’s the crossover point? About 330 deleterious mutations. That’s where beneficial become more likely. 

[Figure 2.]( https://i.imgur.com/hMShpg9.png
)

X axis is number of deleterious mutations that have occurred, Y axis is frequency of mutations. Red line is deleterious, blue is beneficial. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, these are of course not linear relationships. The probably changes with each mutation, not just at the crossover point where beneficial becomes more likely. So as each mutation occurs, the downward slop of deleterious mutations (i.e. the rate at which that occur) decreases, while the upward slope of beneficial mutations also decreases. The result is that they asymptotically approach the equilibrium point, resulting in a genome that is at dynamic equilibrium between beneficial and harmful mutations. 

And *that*, my friends, is the first reason why harmful mutations cannot accumulate at a constant rate over time. 

&amp;nbsp;

The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact. Say you have two sites: J and K, and they can be J (normal) or j (mutation). It can be the case that j and k, each on their own, are deleterious, but together are beneficial. So just considering these two sites, you start off with two possible deleterious mutations and zero possible beneficial mutations. But if J --&gt; j occurs, now you have two possible beneficial mutations (j back to J, or K to k), and zero possible deleterious mutations. This type of thing is well known – it’s part of the [lobster trap model]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01223.x
) of why we can’t get rid of antibiotic resistance.

In the above examples, we’re not considering epistasis, but it would also be occurring. So with each harmful mutation that occurs, not only are you changing the frequencies as described above, you’re *also* turning previously deleterious mutations into beneficial mutations. So in addition to making extremely unrealistic assumptions with regard to the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations, *and* completely omitting selection, we’re *also* leaving out this additional factor that facilitates reaching this equilibrium point faster. 

&amp;nbsp;

So put these two things together, and I hope everyone reading can see why we can’t assign absolute fitness values to specific mutations, how the occurrence of one mutation can cause the fitness effects of other mutations to change, and how that inevitably leads to an equilibrium where beneficial and deleterious mutations occur at the same rate. And why all that means you can’t, as Sanford et al. want to do, allow deleterious mutations to accumulate at a constant rate, even without selection. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 2. Mutation-Selection Balance**

That’s all well and good, but all of that stuff only deals with mutations. We need to talk about the other side of the ledger: Selection.

Adding selection introduces a new concept: Mutation-selection balance. Though I hope it is clear, the point of this section will be to explain how and why, once we add selection to the equation, the equilibrium we found above shifts away from deleterious mutations (because they are selected out of the population).

In order for this to happen, the strength of selection must be high enough for the selection to operate. The strength of selection is more technically called the *selection differential*, the fitness difference between individuals with a specific mutation and the average population fitness. If the difference is large enough, that mutation can be selected for or against (depending on the sign of the differential). 

The rate at which mutations are selected out is based on the rate at which they occur and the selection differential. 

Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated. I don’t know where this threshold is supposed to be, and I don’t think creationists know either, but the fact that it must exist (because if it doesn’t, then creationists are in effect arguing that deleterious mutations can accumulate in a linear fashion without affecting fitness, which is the opposite of what Sanford claims wrt “genetic entropy”) means that *at some point* as mutations occur, selection against deleterious mutations *will* begin to occur. This will slow the rate at which deleterious mutations accumulate, ultimately resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between mutations occurring and being selected out.

&amp;nbsp;

Considering this in the context of what we modeled above, we have two options for what can occur:

1) The selection threshold (the number of mutations that must occur for selection to kick in) is beyond the equilibrium point. In this scenario, the genome in question settles at the equilibrium described above, without selection affecting the number of deleterious mutations. 

or

2) The selection threshold is *before* the “no selection” equilibrium, in which case the genome in question settles at a *different* equilibrium, one with *fewer* deleterious mutations that expected based on the above models. 

Under either case, you still arrive at an equilibrium at which deleterious mutations stop accumulating. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 3. Why this matters for “genetic entropy”**

Now, with all that in mind, I’m going to provide a mechanistic description of how “genetic entropy” supposedly works. I’m going to use Sanford’s (and other creationists’) language here, even though they use several terms incorrectly. 

According to Sanford, the process works like this: Most mutations are deleterious, but the effects are so small they have no effect on reproductive output. But they are still harmful to the fitness (health, function, etc.) of the organism. Over time, as these unselectable “very slightly deleterious mutations” accumulate in every individual, the overall health and ultimately the overall reproductive output of the population decline to below the level of replacement, ultimately resulting in extinction. 

See the problem?

In order for this to happen, two things must be true: There is no selection against deleterious mutations *even as reproductive output declines* (this is literally a contradiction), and deleterious mutations *must constantly accumulate* (impossible, as we saw above). 

Which means “genetic entropy” simply does not work. Period. 

And one more point: Assuming selection *does* occur (which, like, natural selection occurs, y’all), the implication is that every organism, every *genome* exists right on the precipice of experiencing a deleterious mutation and getting selected out, all the time. But we’ve adapted the repair mistakes, and live at an equilibrium where most mutations don’t do anyone one way or the other.  

Sanford’s argument *assumes* special creation because it *requires* an optimal “starting point” from which everything inevitably decays. That’s not what we see. Every genome has existed right on this knife’s edge, forever. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 4. Additional Points**

This is not an answer to every anti-evolution argument. This is an answer to one specific anti-evolution argument: “genetic entropy”.

If you, dear reader, think I am wrong, and that “genetic entropy” is a real thing that occurs, explain why the above reasoning is faulty. *Show your work*. 

That would involve showing how, given a realistic (or even an unrealistic, like those above) set of assumptions, deleterious mutations actually *do* accumulate constantly in a genome. 

It would *not* involve changing the topic to things like “well mutation and selection can’t build complex structures” or “selection constantly removes functions”. Those are *different* anti-evolution arguments, also invalid, *but are not the topic of this thread*. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Part 5: TL;DR**

Seriously? Just read the damn thing. 

Just kidding. 

For the normies who don’t think about this stuff during most waking (and some non-waking) moments, the point is that as bad mutations occur, the frequency of possible bad mutations decreases, and possible good mutations increases, eventually reaching equilibrium. Selection shifts that equilibrium further away from bad mutations. Since “genetic entropy” requires constant accumulation of bad mutations, and no selection against them, it can’t work.

DebateEvolution,etjksh,misterme987,,t2_47tbvjxf,self.DebateEvolution,,I was asked to repost this here,"The RNA World Hypothesis

The RNA World Hypothesis: The Failure of Modern Origin-of-Life Theories

The RNA world hypothesis is the most developed origin-of-life theories so far, and it tries to explain how information in DNA, metabolism, and life itself originated. However, this post will show the utter failure of this theory to actually explain the origin of life.

The main premise of this theory is that, before the first living cells originated, the prebiotic world was composed of RNA and, later, RNA viruses. As RNA has been seen to self-replicate in some cases, and ribozymes, or catalytic enzymes like polymerases made of RNA, have been shown to exist, it is assumed that RNA could take the place of both DNA and proteins.

Once the first ribozyme polymerase (able to copy other RNA strands) originated, then strands could replicate, and the laws of natural selection and mutation could take over from there. As more and more complex ribozymes began to originate, and simple lipid cell membranes took them into their cavities, then simple metabolism could evolve. After this, ribonucleoproteins such as ribosomes could take over, and finally, simple cellular life could evolve.

The first hurdle that this theory comes to is the chemical evolution of nucleobases (A, U, G, and C). These are the molecules that encode information in DNA and cause ribozymes to work. Although some scientists suggest that specific nucleobases, such as adenine (A) [can be made by natural processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077245/), others accept that [nucleobases are unlikely to be created naturally](https://www.pnas.org/content/96/8/4396). Even to make a 0.5% concentration of adenine take unrealistically high concentrations of HCN that likely did not exist in early oceans. In our cells, there is a complex sequence of specific, metabolic proteins to make nucleobases. Also, the reaction that makes nucleobases from HCN makes many undesirable products that would interfere with RNA production.

Also, nucleobases have [very short half-lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20907/). At the temperatures of hydrothermal vents (more than 100 degrees Celsius), cytosine has a half-life of only 19 days, which means that the origin of life would have to have take place within only several years. I can’t stress enough how unlikely this would be.

The second hurdle the theory comes to is the making of ribose sugar. Ribose is the first component of the backbone of RNA (and the R in RNA). There is already a natural process that makes this sugar called the [formose reaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) which begins with formaldehyde. This has even been observed to take place at the temperatures and pressures of hydrothermal vents. The only problem with this is that [it cannot take place in the presence of nitrogenous compounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2453009), such as the ones that are formed from the production of nucleobases, This is because nitrogenous compounds would chemically react with the formaldehyde that is needed to start the reaction.

So, proponents of the RNA world theory need to explain how ribose could be made apart from the nucleobases, then come in contact with them in a high enough concentration to provoke a *thermodynamically uphill reaction*.

This brings us to the theory’s third hurdle, which is the making of nucleotides. These are the fundamental units of RNA, that are made from a nucleobase, a ribose sugar, and a phosphate ion. To form this, there would need to be a high concentration of phosphate. However, because phosphate is an ion, it is generally trapped in stable minerals. Any free PO^-3 will be quickly ‘snapped up’ by free calcium ions in the ocean. Though [some origin-of-life researchers think this could be solved with sulfur](https://cosmosmagazine.com/chemistry/life-without-phosphate-mystery-solved), there is no known analogue to RNA with anything other than phosphate.

Another problem with this is that the combination of nucleobases, ribose, and phosphate is a *thermodynamically uphill* reaction. To make nucleotides would require an outside source of energy and an extremely high concentration of each of these things, which is unlikely for the reasons previously mentioned.

Also, you need to make sure that the right nitrogen atom from the nucleobase bonds with the right carbon atom on the ribose sugar. In studies, only [8% of bonds were in the right place](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar50083a002), showing that even if the molecules did combine to form a nucleotide, 92% of them would be wrong, so any RNA strand formed from these would be extremely unlikely to work.

The final challenge to this theory, and the most problematic, is the actual forming of ribozymes. Even assuming that a significant concentration of nucleotides were formed, there are only a few sequences that actually produce an enzyme, so we run into the same problem as specified information in DNA.

Natural selection and copying could only begin after the first ribozyme polymerase was formed. [The shortest effective one yet is called 24-3](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/9786), and it needs a specific sequence of bases 188 nucleotides in length to work. The chance of this forming randomly is one in 4^188, or approximately one in 10^113. Even assuming that the concentration was enough to produce a new RNA sequence every second, the chance of this forming in a million years is still one in 10^99. Given that, at best, life is given a billion years in evolutionary time to form, you can be sure that the RNA world literally would never form “in a billion years”.

DebateEvolution,esr9ns,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Mutation: Evidence for Common Ancestry?,"Is mutation the mechanism for gene creation, speciation, and common ancestry?

It is the Great White Hope, that the belief in common ancestry depends upon.

The belief:
*Random mutations have produced all the variety and complexity we see today, beginning with a single cell.*

This phenomenon has never been observed, cannot be repeated in rigorous laboratory conditions, flies in the face of observable science, yet is pitched as 'settled science!'

*Does mutation 'create' genes?*

No. It alters them, some are survivable, and others deleteriously.   But there is no way a mutated gene can be called a 'New!' gene.  This is like wrecking your car, and calling it a 'New Car!'  Any perceived benefit or 'neutrality' of mutation is by definition or decree.  

**E Coli**

I reviewed this groundbreaking study that allegedly 'proves!' common ancestry here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/ei3l8x/ecoli_proves_common_ancestry_studies_reviewed/

The ability to digest citrates, and mutate, does NOT indicate speciation, nor macro evolution.  It is an adaptation that ecoli was able to do, from inherent genetic abilities.  There is no indication of 'new genes!', or structural changes in the genome.   Ecoli remained ecoli, after over 66,000 generations, only adapting to micro climate conditions.   It is not proof, or evidence of, common ancestry.

Mutation is not the engine of gene creation like so many believe.  It is a deleterious process, that creates nothing.  The complex  features in living things cannot be explained by mutation..  the leap from a single celled amoeba to even a bacteria is untraceable and unexplainable by mutation.  The eye, flight, warm blood..  and countless variety in living organisms have no indication or evidence of being *caused* by mutation. There is nothing observable or repeatable, to compel a conclusion of mutation as an engine of increasing complexity.   It is a belief, with no empirical evidence.

Observation tells us that mutations are neutral, at best, or deleterious to the organism. It is not a creative power for complexity.  Even the claim of 'neutrality!' is based on presumption and decree.

The sci fi imaginations of x-men, or other mutation based themes, project the possibility of this as an explanation for complexity, but there is no evidence that it can, much less did, happen.

An adaptation, or variety, is something that is ALREADY THERE, in the parent stock, and is 'selected', by human or natural means, to survive.

A mutation only alters an existing trait, (or gene, exactly). It is not a selective process, but a deleterious one, that degrades the organism in almost every case.

Ecoli, adapting to digest citrates, is not evidence for common ancestry. It only shows the adaptability of this unique organism. It is not becoming anything else, or changing its genomic architecture.  It is still ecoli.

The belief in common ancestry completely relies on the wishful thinking of mutation,  as the engine for complexity and variability.  There is  no credible evidence of 'gene creation!' in any study to date. Mutations are not, 'new genes!' Selection, acting on existing variability, does not indicate new genes. Traits, variability, fantastically complex features.. hearing, seeing, flight, intelligence.. almost every trait known in the animal and plant kingdom have no empirical source. The belief in mutation, as a mechanism of increasing complexity has no scientific basis.   It is a religious belief, only.",77,1579775321,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/esr9ns/mutation_evidence_for_common_ancestry/

Oh? Not an issue.

&gt;According to a robotically repeated talking point favored by evolution proponents, loyal adherence to Darwin’s theory is crucial to the future of biological research. Informing the public, including students, about the theory’s weaknesses as well as its strengths would thus threaten not only the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. It would even put lives in peril, since medical research would be handicapped. This might or might not explain the addled logic of a phone message we got over the past weekend from a critic of intelligent design who threatened that ID proponents are guilty of “treason” and should be handled by the law accordingly.

&gt;Yikes! Endangering your country’s health and wellbeing, if that were the case, would certainly not be a laudable act. But is a skeptical view of Darwinian theory really “anti-science,” as other critics like to say? Well, when you find something amazing, and there are countless amazing things in biology, you want to understand it. Does that require a Darwinian just-so story? These news items show otherwise. Students might become more motivated to study science, in fact, if given a sense of awe at nature’s wonders, without the usual appeals to happenstance.

Sounds like a strawman to me.

&gt;News from New York University begins without Darwin, and continues to approach the subject of DNA repair free of evolutionary shackles.

&gt;The scientists made DNA glow green, and introduced breaks that glowed red. Watching the reactions, they found that broken areas became denser and moved more quickly as repair processes acted on them. No evolution was required to increase understanding that could potentially better our health.

Oh? https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-26887-1_11
Learning why, is just as important as well as the how it works.

&gt;Those who like to bake salmon have undoubtedly been struck by the chevron shapes in the muscles. All fish have this characteristic pattern, which “is thought to increase swimming efficiency,” according to research from the National University of Singapore (NUS). How does the pattern come about? Is it genetically driven, or is there some other process at work? The scientists didn’t even consider Darwinian evolution as they sought the answer.

&gt;Notably, several mentions of evolution in the PNAS paper have nothing to do with Darwinism, but rather with the unfolding (“evolution”) of the patterns during development. One brief exception mentions that “the shape is tightly controlled and may be evolutionarily optimized.” Performing a Darwin-ectomy on that sentence would cause no harm to the science.

Yes, because we shouldn't consider how these processes come about. I mean it's not like embryology is important to evolution yes? https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-beneficial-consequences-of-having-chevron-or-V-shaped-myomeres-illustrated-using_fig2_225306766

&gt;Another paper in PNAS about epigenetics does perfectly fine without appeals to Darwinian evolution. The “Perspective” article by Aristizabel et al., “Biological embedding of experience: A primer on epigenetics,” includes only one reference to “evolutionary time”:

Yes, because passing on modified genes has nothing to do with evolution huh?

 &gt;As more scientific research proceeds in the absence of references to unguided evolution, science will get stronger, leaner, and more motivated. Let the Darwin stories go, and free up science for a resurgence of awe and wonder that first motivated early scientists.

Evolution is not a force in off itself, but of multiple processes like DNA repair, mutations, embryology. Evolution is the umbrella that brings these studies together and how they affect one another. 

Likewise these studies only show what is going on but not why...as in why things are this way. 

By telling people to ignore Darwinism then, you are limiting their curosity.

&gt;It will take some radical surgery to remove the Darwinian concepts in the Grants’ paper, but will the science survive? Take a closer look at what they actually found. First of all, they admit that the effect of introgressive hybridization on adaptive radiation is “not known.” Ponder that for a moment. After 160 years, has Darwinism been so useless that it has not shed light on a process that should have been well known by now, particularly with these iconic birds? Even worse, though, is that introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system. Search for “selection” in the paper and you find only faith, not evidence, that natural selection might work in tandem with introgressive hybridization to produce new species. The only examples of selection they offer involve microevolution, not innovation. For those, they do lateral passes to other Darwinists in the references. 

Wait what did you say?
&gt;introgression and hybridization involve shuffling existing genetic information. It has nothing to do with variation by random mutation being “selected” by a blind watchmaker, much less being able to build an irreducibly complex system.

But you are describing evolution but say that it isn't evolution. Decent by modification! How does shuffilling around genetic information not cause an increase in information?!

&gt;Their work not only relies on Darwinism, but promises to help future research. How could anyone claim that Darwinism is useless to this paper? Actually, it’s quite easy. It’s as easy as showing that any other kind of circular reasoning is useless in science. These seven biologists assumed evolution, and concluded evolution. The observations had nothing to do with it.

From the study they link to: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/42/21094.short

&gt;Echolocation is a prime example of convergent evolution, the independent gain of similar features in species of different lineages. Is phenotypic convergence driven by underlying molecular convergence? If so, could molecular convergence include contributions from highly constrained, often-pleotropic, coding regions? We develop a generalizable test that offers a resounding “yes” to both extensively debated questions. Our test highlights molecular convergence in genes regulating the cochlear ganglion of echolocating bats and whales, the skin of aquatic mammals, and the lung of high-altitude mammals. Importantly, the approach correctly dismisses confounding convergence-like patterns, such as those from sequence decay of vision genes in blind subterranean species, and is readily applicable to the thousands of genomes sequenced across the tree of life.

How do they respond?

&gt;Some extreme examples can show the fallacy. Humans and turtles can hold their breath underwater. Is that convergent evolution? Turtles can’t think, but humans can. Is that divergent evolution? If tricycles and race cars alike are found to contain both aluminum and iron, did they obtain those through blind, unguided processes? So it is with two very different mammals — bats and whales — that use sound for echolocation. Neither the similarities nor differences prove convergent evolution (or divergent evolution, for that matter), unless you start with that assumption. It’s a non sequitur to conclude they evolved.

It would be very problematic if many species were found that combined characteristics of different nested groupings. Some nonvascular plants could have seeds or flowers, like vascular plants, but they do not. Gymnosperms (e.g. conifers or pines) occasionally could be found with flowers, but they never are. Non-seed plants, like ferns, could be found with woody stems; however, only some angiosperms have woody stems.

Conceivably, some birds could have mammary glands or hair; some mammals could have feathers (they are an excellent means of insulation). Certain fish or amphibians could have differentiated or cusped teeth, but these are only characteristics of mammals.
These patterns are here because evolution predicts that a new trait will emerge from an existing trait. These traits will be cultivated by the environment as they will help organisms live long enough to reproduce and pass on those traits with modification.
A mix and match of characters would make it extremely difficult to objectively organize species into nested hierarchies. Unlike organisms, cars do have a mix and match of characters, and this is precisely why a nested hierarchy does not flow naturally from classification of cars. Indeed a designer wouldn't need to follow any patter because it wouldn't have the same limitation as evolution and thus wouldn't need to follow the same pattern.

DebateEvolution,er0vih,DefenestrateFriends,PhD Genetics/MS Medicine Student,t2_g050d,self.DebateEvolution,,An evaluation of the genetic entropy hypothesis by a genetic scientist,"Hi folks,  
   
I have been discussing the principle tenets of an allele-frequency hypothesis called “Genetic Entropy” with a proponent. Many of you have seen this hypothesis floating around on the sub before and many of you have given it critical feedback. I’m hoping to add to that conversation by highlighting some of the scientific and technical reasons why this hypothesis is unsupported. I’m mostly going to focus on the data and not on the downstream conclusions about creationism or word choices like “entropy.”   
 

*Background:*   
What is genetic entropy (GE)? GE is a hypothesis proposed by Dr. John Sanford which predicts that functionally deleterious single-nucleotide mutations are inherited with each generation and accumulate in the organism/population. The accumulation of these mutations is then hypothesized to result in the progressive loss of integrity (hence the “entropy”) in a genome causing increased disease prevalence and ultimately death of the organism. It is then argued that if GE occurs, evolution is not possible since the organism is progressively experiencing a degradation in fitness which is not surmounted by positive selection. Essentially this hypothesis is an extreme form of Error Catastrophe which postulates that all life on earth operates past the critical mutation rate threshold.  

These are the four basic premises that must be true for functionally deleterious mutations to accumulate:   
 

1) Nearly all mutations have some effect on the organism—there are essentially no truly neutral mutations

2) Most mutations are very small in effect

3) The vast majority of mutations are damaging

4) Very small mutations are not subject to natural selection

 

*What are mutations?*   
   
Mutation: a variant or change in the heritable material of an organism. Normally, we refer to mutations as “variants” because of all the different forms and effects they can take on—substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, inversion, conversion, frame shift, extension, synonymous, non-synonymous, DNA/RNA, transposons, linear, circular, coding, non-coding, imprinting, methylation, base adducts, structural, non-structural, pathogenic, clinical, loss of function, gain of function, etc.  
 

When referring to a mutation, it’s important to adequately describe the type of mutation occurring. I primarily study human genetics and so I use the nomenclature proposed by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) with the database ascension and human genome version identifiers. For example, the genomic identifier for a single-nucleotide variant in one of my favorite genes, MC1R, is NC\_000016.9:g.89986117C&gt;A. The protein identifier for that same variant is NP\_002377.4:p.Arg151Ser and the coding DNA identifier is NM\_002386.3:c.451C&gt;A.  
 

The mutation rate in humans is something around 1.0 × 10^(−9) mutations/nucleotide/year (95% CI: 3.0 × 10^(−10)–2.5 × 10^(−9)), or 3.0 × 10^(−8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95% CI: 8.9 × 10^(−9)–7.0 × 10^(−8)). Some loci (coding is lower, non-coding is higher, chromatin access etc) mutate at different rates than others and de novo mutation rates are affected by life-history traits of the parents (age, exposures, etc) in a sex-specific manner. When measured directly, trio probands show between 20 and 155 de novo mutations per offspring with an average around 40. 

What is evolution?

1. Evolution is defined as the change in allele frequencies in a population over generations.

2. Evolution is a process that occurs by 6 mechanisms: mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating, recombination, and natural selection. Sometimes this is referred to as 4 primary and 2 ancillary mechanisms because mating and recombination fall under the natural selection umbrella.

3. Evolution is not abiogenesis.

4. Evolutionary processes explain the diversity of life on Earth.

5. Evolution is not a moral or ethical claim.

6. Evidence for evolution comes in the forms of anatomical structures, biogeography, fossils, direct observation, and molecular biology--namely genetics. Genetic evidence is overwhelming and outweighs the others.

7. There are many ways to differentiate species. The classification of species is a manmade construct, is somewhat arbitrary, and varies across fields.  


*What is neutral theory, nearly neutral theory, and selectionist theory?* 

Population genetics is often concerned with which mechanism of evolution contributes more to allele change frequencies in a population. The two primary mechanisms seem to be natural selection and genetic drift. Neutral theory posits that variation mainly arises from stochastic processes (i.e. genetic drift) which distribute functionally neutral alleles and was proposed by Kimura Motoo in 1955/1968. Nearly neutral theory is an extension of neutral theory proposed by Tomoko Ohta in 1973. She suggested that natural selection can be overpowered by genetic drift in special circumstances relating to the size of the effective mating population and allows for slightly deleterious mutations to reach fixation. Once the effective population size gets large enough, natural selection overtakes influence on that allele and it is purified from the population. Selectionist theory posits that variation is primarily due to advantageous alleles propagated in a population. Neutral theory is now mostly used as a null hypothesis to detect selection.  
 

Neutralist and selectionist mechanisms both contribute to variation within in populations. I should also mention that anyone trying to base their understanding of current evolutionary processes should not use publications from the 60’s and 70’s. These papers and theories were proposed nearly 50 years before we had the data to adequately interrogate their predictions. There are numerous errors in Kimura’s model (didn’t know how many base pairs there were in the human genome or about codon bias etc.), but many of the basic predictions were true.  
 

Here’s a paper that explains the history and evidences for neutral theory:   
 Hughes AL. Near neutrality: leading edge of the neutral theory of molecular evolution. *Ann N Y Acad Sci*. 2008;1133:162–179. doi:10.1196/annals.1438.001

Here is a paper that explains the problems with neutral theory:  
 Kern, A. D. &amp; Hahn, M. W. The Neutral Theory in Light of Natural Selection. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **35**, 1366–1371 (2018).

 

*What are neutral mutations?*

Much of the discussion seems to revolve around the definition and existence of neutral mutations. There seems to have been some confusion when articulating the GE position because it attempts to appropriate operational language from the neutral theory of evolution. Here are the correct definitions of these terms.  
   
The action of a mutation can be defined in one of two ways: operationally or functionally. The operational definition describes how the mutation propagates in a population. The functional definition describes what the mutation does at the molecular level to the organism.  
 

Kimura using the operational definitions of mutation, since the frequency is OPERATIONALLY dependent on the POPULATION SIZE:

(17a) the mutant is **advantageous** such that **2Nes&gt;&gt;1**

(17b) it is **deleterious** such that **2Nes &gt;&gt;1 in which s‘=-s**

(17c) it is **almost neutra**l such that **|2Nes| &lt;&lt; 1**.

Kimura using the functional definition of mutation, since the function of the allele depends on the FITNESS CONFERRED and NOT the population size:

“These results suggest that mutations having a **definite advantage or disadvantage** can not contribute greatly to the heterozygosity of an individual because of the **rare occurrence of advantageous mutations and rapid elimination of deleterious ones.”**

**“Assuming that the majority of molecular mutations due to base substitution is almost neutral for natural selection** and that they occur at the rate of 2 per gamete per generation\[...\]”

\[And several other places in this paper and in all of his works\]

Kimura, M. Genetic variability maintained in a finite population due to mutational production of neutral and nearly neutral isoalleles. *Genet. Res.* **11**, 247–270 (1968).  
 

Having a mastery and understanding of these terms is important because a mutation can be called operationally neutral but be functionally highly deleterious. This is why we consider the functional consequences of a mutation and not the operational descriptor. Here’s an example:   
 

If a deleterious mutation with *s* = −0.001 occurs in a population of *N* = 106, |*s*| is much greater than 1/(2*N*) = 5 × 3 10^(−7). The fitness of mutant homozygotes will be lower than that of wild-type homozygotes only by 0.002. This fitness difference is easily swamped by the large random variation in the number of offspring among different individuals, by which *s* is defined. By contrast, in the case of brother-sister mating *N* = 2, so that even a semi-lethal mutation with *s* = −0.25 will be called neutral. If this mutation is fixed in the population, the mutant homozygote has a fitness of 0.5 compared with the nonmutant homozygote. A fitness decrease of half is removed from the population by natural selection.  
   
Nei, M. Selectionism and neutralism in molecular evolution. *Mol. Biol. Evol.* **22**, 2318–42 (2005).

&amp;#x200B;

*Are the majority of mutations deleterious or neutral?* 

Proponents of the GE hypothesis are quick to point out that, “most experts in the field believe that the majority of mutations are deleterious.” Popular quotes are plucked from the works of:  
 

Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. The fitness effects of spontaneous mutations nearly unseen by selection in a bacterium with multiple chromosomes. *Genetics* **204**, 1225–1238 (2016).

Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley, P. D. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. *Nature Reviews Genetics* **8**, 610–618 (2007).

Keightley, P. D. &amp; Lynch, M. Toward a realistic model of mutations affecting fitness. *Evolution* **57**, 683–685 (2003).

Kimura, M. Model of effectively neutral mutations in which selective constraint is incorporated. *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.* **76**, 3440–3444 (1979).

&amp;#x200B;

Of note, GE proponents selectively misquote these works and apply the authors’ quotes to the entire genome when only the coding-regions are specifically addressed. For example:   
 

The GE proponent quotes Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007):

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small.”  
 

The full quote in context (ibid.): 

“The first point to make is one of definition; it seems unlikely that any mutation is truly neutral in the sense that it has no effect on fitness. All mutations must have some effect, even if that effect is vanishingly small. However, there is **a class of mutations that we can term effectively neutral**. These are mutations **for which** ***Nes*** **is much less than 1, the fate of which is largely determined by random genetic drift.** As such, the definition of neutrality **is operational rather than functional**; it depends on **whether natural selection is effective on the mutation in the population or the genomic context in which it segregates**, not solely on the effect of the mutation on fitness.”

These definitions form Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) are specifically referencing mutation accumulation (MA) assays which historically interrogated only coding-region mutations. More recent MA experiments often characterize whole genome mutations such as in Dillon, M. M. &amp; Cooper, V. S. (2016).  Eyre-Walker, A. &amp; Keightley (2007) go on to say:   
 

“Unfortunately, accurate measurement of the **effects of single mutations is possible only when they have fairly large effects on fitness** (say &gt;1%; that is, a mutation that increases or decreases viability or fertility by more than 1%)”

“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**”

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.”

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95% and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50% of mutations are deleterious.**”

After being presented with the contextualized quotes, GE acolytes tend to ignore this dilemma and try to quote other sources such as the MA experiments conducted by Dillon *et al.* (2016). 

&amp;#x200B;

GE supporters believe that MA experiments adequately represent natural evolutionary phenomena and that the results favor the GE hypothesis. Here’s why that is untrue: 

1. MA experiments **do not allow natural selection to happen**, meaning that the deleterious mutations cannot be selected out from the populations.

2. Bacterial strains used in MA experiments have certain DNA repair genes **disabled so that MORE mutations occur** i.e.—not natural

3. The coding regions in these species represent **HUGE portions of their total genome 80-90% versus 10-20% noncoding**. The human genome is about 1% coding.

4. The **majority of mutations are not deleterious** \[as shown in these experiments and in direct opposition to GE premises stated earlier\] and that only rarely occurring mutations cause the fitness declination observed in these studies.

This means, MA experiments a) don't support GE in the slightest and b) are not analogs for human evolution.

Here are the results from Dillon *et al.* (2016) MA experiment:

In the M9MM environment, 4 mutation carriers even had greater fitness than the ancestral genome. This means that effects of the mutations are dependent on the environment i.e.—natural selection. Here are several quotes from that paper demonstrating that more neutral mutations occur than deleterious mutations even in the near absence of natural selection:

“Specifically, MA experiments **limit the efficiency of natural selection** by passaging replicate lineages through repeated single-cell bottlenecks.”

“Here, we measured the relative fitness of 43 fully sequenced MA lineages derived from *Burkholderia cenocepacia* HI2424 in three laboratory environments after they had been evolved **in the near absence of natural selection for 5554 generations**. Following the MA experiment, each lineage harbored a total **mutational load of 2–14 spontaneous mutations**, including base substitution mutations (bpsms), insertion-deletion mutations (indels), and whole-plasmid deletions.”

“Lastly, the genome of *B. cenocepacia* is composed of **6,787,380 bp (88.12%) coding DNA** and **915,460 bp (11.88%) noncoding DNA**. Although both bpsms and indels were observed more frequently than expected in noncoding DNA (bpsms: χ2 = 2.19, d.f. = 1, *P* = 0.14; indels: χ2 = 45.816, d.f. = 1, *P* &lt; 0.0001)”

“In combination, these results suggest that the fitness effects of **a majority of spontaneous mutations were near neutral, or at least undetectable**, with plate-based laboratory fitness assays. Given the average selection coefficient of each line and the number of mutations that it harbors, we can estimate that the **average fitness effect (*****s*****) of a single mutation was –0.0040 ± 0.0052 (SD) in TSOY, –0.0031 ± 0.0044 (SD) in M9MM+CAA, and –0.0017 ± 0.0043 (SD) in M9MM**.”

“Despite acquiring multiple mutations, the fitness of a number of MA lineages **did not differ significantly from the ancestral strain.** Further, the number of spontaneous mutations in a line **did not correlate with their absolute selection coefficients** in any environment (Spearman’s rank correlation; TSOY: d.f. = 41, *S* = 15742, rho = –0.1886, *P* = 0.2257; M9MM+CAA: d.f. = 41, *S* = 13190, rho = 0.0041, *P* = 0.9793; and M9MM: d.f. = 41, *S* = 16293, rho = –0.2303, *P* = 0.1374)”

“Because the fitness of many lineages with multiple mutations did not significantly differ from the ancestor, and because mutation number and fitness were not correlated, this study suggests **that most of the significant losses and gains in fitness were caused by rare, single mutations with large fitness effects.**”

“Here, we estimate that *s* ≅ 0 in all three environments, **largely because the vast majority of mutations appear to have near neutral effects on fitness**. These estimates **are remarkably similar** to estimates from studies of MA lines with fully characterized mutational load in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *S. cerevisiae* (Lynch *et al.* 2008; Heilbron *et al.* 2014), but are lower than estimates derived from unsequenced MA lineages (Halligan and Keightley 2009; Trindade *et al.* 2010).”

The GE proponent that I was discussing with ignored the paper’s conclusion and focused on this quote in the discussion section of the paper:   
 

""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007; Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""

After pointing out that these experiments are explicitly referring to coding-region mutations context, hyper mutation strains, or non-sequencing fitness assays which do not assess total mutations; the GE proponent again tried to quote mine Heilbron *et al.* (2014) paper: 

""After 644 generations of mutation accumulation, MA lines had accumulated an average of 118 mutations, and we found that average fitness across all lines decayed linearly over time.""

The conclusion of Heilbron *et al.* (2014) was ignored by the GE proponent: 

“These steps did not contain a significantly greater number of mutations than the remaining steps (mean of five largest steps: 9.0 mutations, mean of remainder: 7.9 mutations, paired *t*\-test: *P* = 0.285, *t*4 = 1.235). However, these large deleterious steps showed a significantly higher frequency of mutations in highly conserved core genes than other steps (χ2 goodness-of-fit test: *P* = 0.049, χ21 = 3.882; [Table S2](http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.114.163147/-/DC1/genetics.114.163147-6.pdf)). Therefore, large drops in fitness **are due to mutations in more important genes rather than due to a greater number of mutations**.”  
 

This is exactly what MA experiments are designed to do—normally natural selection prunes these heavily deleterious mutations from the population, however, NS is controlled in MA experiments and therefore this doesn’t happen. GE requires a greater number of deleterious mutations than neutral mutations which is the exact opposite of what this paper shows even in the near absence of NS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of pointing to contrived MA experiments to support GE, proponents should use sequencing data from humans and perform a real analysis. I have challenged GE supporters to do this on several occasions which have been ignored. Here is my analysis:   
 

Gómez-Romero et al. (2018) identified de novo mutations in the offspring of a trio proband. 58 mutations were found with 35x coverage on the parents and 100x on the child. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variants (barring PCR primer difficulties).

[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802244115)

The variants identified in this study can be found in Table S4: [https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/05/01/1802244115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1802244115.sapp.pdf)

Using these 58 mutations, please exactly list their character as “neutral” “deleterious” or “beneficial.” Then let us know the method you employed, the ratio of deleterious to neutral, and at what point the child in this study will go “extinct.”

If you cannot do this simple task, then you cannot test GE and you lose.

**Hint: I have already done the analysis with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)**. The analysis can be viewed here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr\_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA-sG6F27ili6ZuBMQ1InpMr_TyTYad2LP0B95F8pNA/edit#gid=0)

Of the 58 mutations detected, zero are shown to have deleterious effects and only two are missense variants--of which are predicted to be benign.

Conclusion:   
The GE hypothesis is not supported by data and primarily relies on misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers. I'm calling this fallacy of misquoting and misrepresenting scientific papers while never doing experiments (appropriated unapologetically and nonconsensually from another user) ""The Atheist Jesus."" This is a fallacy committed by those who believe quoting scientists is an adequate method to demonstrate scientific validity in the absence of hypothesis testing. For example:  
""Charles Darwin said \[XYZ\] about evolution, therefore evolution isn't true."" Charles Darwin is not ""The Atheist Jesus"" and his words carry no scientific validity until tested.

He says, ""It seems to say that there are not very many ways in which proteins can evolve, but this is exactly what ID science has determined already."" Except that's not what the article says, and that's not what ID claims, either.

[The paper](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1126/science.1123539) is from Science, 312(5770), 111–114.

The quick and dirty is that scientists observed that a certain (Beta)-lactamase allele increased resistance to an antibiotic by about 100,000x. The researchers discovered that this allele differs from the normal variation of this allele by five point mutations. All five of these mutations must be done for the new allele to be highly resistant.

The paper explains that to reach these five mutations, there are 120 different pathways that could be reached. However, only certain orders increase the resistance and would benefit the bacterium.

Through models and experimentation, the researchers discovered that certain mutations either were deleterious or neutral, while others had limited fixation rates in the population. This means that through natural selection, only certain pathways toward the five mutations could be realized to become resistant.

The paper does not argue that proteins have limited paths to form. The paper only looks at one allele with multiple mutations required to reach it, and what pathways would be favorable or even plausible to make a population retain those steps before reaching the allele with high resistance.

The paper even concludes with this:

&gt; Our conclusion is also consistent with results from prospective experimental evolution studies, in which replicate evolutionary realizations have been observed to follow largely identical mutational trajectories. However, the retrospective, combinatorial strategy employed here substantially enriches our understanding of the process of molecular evolution because it enables us to characterize all mutational trajectories, including those with a vanishingly small probability of realization [which is otherwise impractical]. This is important because it draws attention to the mechanistic basis of selective inaccessibility. It now appears that intramolecular interactions render many mutational trajectories selectively inaccessible, which implies that replaying the protein tape of life might be surprisingly repetitive.

That is, because there are only a limited number of pathways, and those pathways require certain steps to be in place for the next mutation, we can repeat this process once the winning trajectories start to become fixated. We know that this happens not only from this paper but also from Lenski's E. coli experiment.

So this again puts to rest the need for a designer, and just shows that random mutation + natural selection can come to novel features given the proper pressures, attempts and time.",74,1579328271,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eqcv4q/umrh2_wants_some_help_understanding_the_paper/

Unfortunately, there are so many outright lies, misrepresentations, complete ignorance and other such fatal problems with the slides that they're only useful for how not to make any arguments for one side or against another.

**Slide 1** is just the title card.

**Slide 2** is the table of contents. It lists pages even though this is a slide show. Not that big of a deal.

**Slide 3** is the title card for the first section, ""Science.""

**Slide 4** is the PRATT about ""observational vs. historical science."" This is just one of Ken Ham's complete fabrications about how science fits into two categories, of which one is just unverifiable (you'll never guess which one evolution falls into!). But the worst part are the points for each side.

Observational includes ""Composed of empirical evidence,"" ""Can be independently verified"" and ""No initial assumptions."" The first and third don't fit into what would be considered observations in science. You can make observations without running an experiment. And you can make assumptions before observations as well.

For historical, we get the points ""Rests on (but not composed of) empirical evidence,"" ""Cannot be independently verified"" and ""Rests on initial assumptions / worldviews."" All of these are also incorrect, since processes that happened in the past can be measured via experiment, can be verified independently by others who try to replicate such experiments, and don't require any particular world views or need any more assumptions than testing a hypothesis.

So already we are on the first slide of claims and nearly every single one fails.

**Slide 5** are six ""things we know from operational science."" Yet all of these are part of evolutionary biology.

**Slide 6** asks the question, ""Does operational data translate into historical theories?"" with a question mark over two paths coming from ""Things we know: DNA, Proteins, Mutation, Natural Selection, Fossils, Genetics"" and going to either ""Evolution"" or ""Creation."" And that's it. The ""Science"" section makes no other case other than wrongly suggesting that there's two types of science, operational and historical.

&gt;The proof: Erosion rates are too fast to be consistent with an old earth.
There are 2,000 arches remaining in Arches National Park. They are collapsing at a rate of one per year. In 2,000 years they will all be gone. https://creation.com/age-of-arches

This argument makes two erroneous assumptions, first that all of the arches present were present at the moment of creation, and secondly that new arches are not being formed. 

The sandstone that makes up arches was burred deep underground 65 million years ago, wrinkled like a dirty shirt. Uplift and erosion recently exposed it to the surface. Today water and freeze thaw weathering are producing arches. 

&gt;The White Cliffs of Dover (deposited during the Cretaceous period) are eroding at a rate of 1 meter every 6 years. If the cliffs have been eroding at 1 meter every 6 years since the end of the Cretaceous, more than 10,000 km of coastline would have eroded away -- the distance from London to Cape Town, South Africa. England must have been HUGE back in the day. https://creation.com/vanishing-coastlines

Much like the previous argument, this argument erroneously assumes a constant rate of erosion. Poor beach management, increased storms, and acidification of the ocean has increased erosion in the last 150 years. According to [Science World Report](https://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/51981/20161110/historic-white-cliffs-dover-vanish-study-reveals.htm) the rate of erosion is 22 to 32cm per year.

&gt;""People speak about millions of years so easily. It rolls off the tongue. But when we think about what these unimaginable eons of time actually mean, we find they do not match what we observe. The erosion we see on the coastlines all over the world is not consistent with the idea of millions of years.""

I'm always curious what a YEC thinks the earth will look like in millions of years. 

The consistent assumption that deposition, mountain building, volcanism etc. do not occur today is tiresome.",28,1579235109,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epvcuz/more_arguments_to_debunk_from_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,epu40z,SaggysHealthAlt,Young Earth Creationist,t2_4h4ws52t,self.DebateEvolution,,A few questions on Abiogenesis from a Creationist recently receiving lots of attention.,"Hi r/debateevolution! It's about time I make my own post here. I've been receiving attention, usually negative attention, getting called over from my fortress at r/creation. What else could I expect from you guys when I post things like the 95 thesis against Evolution in my own subreddit completely minding my own business? Nevermind that, I got a few questions for you guys!

1. Abiogenesis is yet to be proven either naturally or expirementally. Based on the fossil record you guys interprete as evidence of Evolution of less complex forms to more complex, it can be assumed that as seculars you would find that  abiogenesis did occur regardless of what observable science has to say about it right now. Would this mean that your basis of abiogenesis occuring relies on *historical science*? 

2. If oxygen was present on the Earth prior to abiogenesis, it would be toxic to the process, meaning no life. If oxygen was not present on Earth, there would be no ozone, meaning the sun rays would kill the process anyways. If abiogenesis was deep under water, this runs back into the oxygen being present problem again. How do you account for this paradox?

3. Let's say, if abiogenesis did occur naturally, how in the primordial world did this organism it get food?

4. Let's say it got food. How did it know how to turn it into glucose?

5. Let's say that abiogenesis occured and it got food. How did this cell form with the ability to form another cell?

6. Let's say everything above was answered. Abiogenesis occured, it got it's food, it knew how to make another cell. Now how did this thing get a genome?

7. Ok, so it somehow, somewhere, from some place, the genome is now in this cell. Wouldn't negative mutations off this little thing eventually?

8. Let's say all problems above are solved. There are problems whatsoever. Now look out your window and see the trees, grass, people, life everywhere. The city, town, rural land around you.  Now ask yourself, do you actually believe you came from this thing?

I hope to get rational answers for my rational questions. You don't always get a Creationist leaving his fortress willing to see what no man's land has in store for him.",35,1579228860,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/epu40z/a_few_questions_on_abiogenesis_from_a_creationist/

DebateEvolution,eo5aw2,ursisterstoy,Evolutionist,t2_ni1r89j,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The evidence for evolution from common ancestry is overwhelming.,"https://youtu.be/Jw0MLJJJbqc

Genetics, phylogenetics, homology, morphology, embryology, and every other line of evidence regarding the diversification of life paints the same picture. 

For an example we can compare humans to chimpanzees, because this is rather controversial for creationists.

Through genetics we have found that we share 98.4% coding gene similarity and by comparing the whole genome the similarity drops to around 96%. This includes genes located in the same location on the same chromosomes, the merger of chromosome 2A and 2B into a single chromosome in humans. Endogenous retroviruses in the same location. The same gene for producing vitamin C broke in the same way in the same location. It isn’t just enough to say there was a common designer when psueudogenes and viruses are found in both lineages in the same location. Also, the molecular clock based on average mutation rates and parsimony places the point of divergence to around six million years ago.

Shared homology shows that we have the same number of hair follicles, the same muscles attached to the same bones, humans having juvenile chimpanzee shaped skulls into adulthood, a fused tail bone in place of an actual tail, fingerprints, pectoral mammary glands - just two of them, we have the same organs with chimpanzee brains developing in the same way but halting earlier. We can both walk bipedally and also climb trees with our grasping hands. The males have reduced bones or no bones at all in their naked pendulous penises.  Also homology is more than just similar shaped body parts having the same name where arms being composed of one bone followed by two followed by small wrist bones followed by hand and finger bones and never in a different order because they are the same bones connected the same way and not just similar bones taking the same function. A non-homologous trait would be the different style wings of birds, bats, and pterosaurs as they have the same arms but different wings. The arms show common ancestry, the wings show convergent evolution. 

Morphology is related to homology but includes all features that look the same regardless of how they formed - showing that they evolved to fit the same function, with homology being the best type of morphology showing shared ancestry with other morphological traits showing shared environmental pressures. Both are consistent with common ancestry as the common ancestor would be from the same location being the same animal. 

Embryology is based on how organisms develop. Ontogeny takes this from zygote to adulthood. The closer related an organism is the more similar they are for longer throughput their ontogeny with the earliest stages of embryonic development showing how we are related to larger categories of organisms. The sperm cells being opisthokonts categorizes us with other opisthokonts like fungi. The development within amniotic fluid makes us a specific type of animal related to all living reptiles, birds, and mammals more closely than salamanders and living fish. The way our organs develop takes us through the phylogeny of our ancestry and by the time we arrive at the latest stages of development we are strikingly similar to the other great apes, especially chimpanzees based on brain development and other features that show common ancestry. 

The fossil record contains thousands of intermediate forms that match up strikingly well with the other lines of evidence providing us tangible evidence for common ancestry without genetics. Sahelanthropus, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Kenyanthropus, and several intermediate forms within our own genus shows evolution occurring over time when we account for the ages of the fossils and the layers in which they are found - making geology another independent line of evidence for evolution over time when paleontology shows that these fossils are found to be in the expected age ranges and geographical locations that only make sense if there was actual evolution occurring over time and is incompatible with all of these intermediate forms existing at the same time.

And finally, phylogeny takes the evidence from all of these other fields. Simply feeding genetic data into a program that compares similarity produces the same phylogenetic relationships as morphology and embryology produce with few differences. When there are differences in phylogeny, it is genetics that takes precedence. 

Is there anything factual that can debunk common ancestry? If there is, it hasn’t been demonstrated. Creationists, the ball is in your court to support your alternative.",224,1578928115,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eo5aw2/the_evidence_for_evolution_from_common_ancestry/

DebateEvolution,entwuz,theHating,,t2_3ywzyhmj,self.DebateEvolution,,I AM NOT A CREATIONIST.,"I had to repost this here because apparently the moderators at r/evolution either dont know how to read or just like to pretend they know how to read.  In any event, they advised me to dump this gasoline tanker all over the creationism debate, enjoy.

To restate, my intention here, as laid out in the OP, is to refute the following two claims:

1. There exists something that can sensibly be called ""THE theory of evolution"", and

2. The theory of evolution ""fits all the facts""



Near the start of their seminal 1972 paper on punctuated equilibria, Niles Eldredge and co-author Stephen Jay Gould specify the position they are militating against: the traditional Darwin-based theory of slow, steady, adaptive evolution. They refer to it as ""phyletic gradualism"".

Gould and Eldredge identify the following four tenets of phyletic gradualism (and I quote):

(1) New species arise by the transformation of an ancestral population into its modified descendents

(2) The transformation is even and slow

(3) The transformation involves large numbers, usually the entire ancestral population

(4) The transformation occurs over all or a large part of the ancestral species' geographical range


One of the testable implications of phyletic gradualism is (and I quote again):

""Ideally, the fossil record for the origin of a new species should consist of a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant""



Now, as some of you may have discovered yourselves, you can show a frothing Darwinian pretty much anything you like and still be told, ""That's perfectly in accordance with my theory. My theory fits all the facts  "".

On the other hand, both thoughtful Darwinians (including CD himself) and their opponents have been aware since the publication of 'Origin' that phyletic gradualism does not fit all the facts: The fossil record does not typically consist of ""a long sequence of continuous, insensibly graded intermediate forms linking ancestor and descendant"".

Few are more keenly aware of this theoretical embarrassment than paleontologists such as Eldredge and Gould themselves.


Does this mean, then, that phyletic gradualism is falsified and must be abandoned? Well, loyal patrons of my ""Falsifiability"" thread will hopefully be aware by now that there is rarely, if ever, a definitive refutation in empirical science. If its defenders are stubborn -- and ingenuous! -- enough, a seemingly troubled theory can always be shielded from falsification by (say) appeal to unrecognized forces or hidden variables, by postulating an undiscovered planet or subatomic particle, or by conjuring up a cosmological constant (as Einstein did).

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range

In the context of human evolution, this makes perfect sense. We first appeared in East Africa, and as we radiated outwards we experienced serial founder events, reducing diversity in non-African populations. Further from Addis Ababa, less diversity. Exactly as expected.

But what's the creationist explanation for these data? How do these findings fit in that paradigm? I'm talking Young Earth, but you still run into just raw diversity problems if you start with a population of N=2, even in the Old Earth timeframe. So answers from either angle are appreciated.

I'm about half done the book and am enjoying it. While the topic of this subreddit hasn't reared its ugly head, she did mention creation.com, and Mike Pence being a YEC.

In the book she argues that scientific consensus is a very useful tool for determining if we can trust science.  She cited eugenics and continental drift as two areas of study that while commonly argued had arrived at consensus, there was no consensus. In the first point she argued that social scientists and some prominent geneticists were both opposed to eugenics, and while American geologists were largely opposed to continental drift, European geologists accepted it more readily, or at least refused to pass judgment. 

Oreskes suggests asking five questions when determine the validity of scientific consensus. 

1. Do the individual in the community bring to bear different perspectives? Do they represent a range of perspectives in terms of ideas, theoretical commitments, methodological preferences and personal value?

2. Have different methods been applied and diverse lines of evidence considered?

3. Has there been ample opportunity for dissenting views to be heard, considered, and weighted?

4. Is the community open to new information and able to be self-critical?

5. Is the community demographically diverse: in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, country of origin, and the like?

While I'm sure some creationists will object to 3 and 4, I think the answer when discussing evolution is a resounding yes.

/u/MRH2 posted these two ideas thinking that they logically cause problems with evolution. It's a safe bet that he just gets these ideas wrong, but let's still investigate his claims.

Claim #1:

""First, in terms of evolution and adaptation, I don't see how evolution can create **stable complex ecosystems.**"" (emphasis his).

He uses an example of the zebra, impala and lion.

&gt; There is a huge environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion.

No, no there's no environmental impetus for the impala to evolve to be faster than the lion. Evolution doesn't work on what someone thinks should be the goal. If a trait forms that allows for the impala to run faster, then that trait likely will propagate to future generations because slower impala will be eaten. But there are other mechanisms which have developed to keep prey from being eaten, such as tougher armor, foul taste, etc. ""Be faster"" is just one trait that several species have evolved over time, and it benefited their populations so it propagated better to offspring over generations.

&gt; Now we've all seen evolution do amazing things, like evolve hearts and lungs, so making an impala be fast enough (or skillful enough) to avoid capture should not be too hard.

Impalas are fast, yes, but to argue that they should evolve to be fast enough to avoid capture and this being an easy evolution is again ignorant of how evolution works. Any advantage that evolves has a trade-off somewhere. Running faster may lead to limbs that are weaker for other things, or requiring more proteins to sustain, or so forth. So it's not just something that is ""easy"" but a matter of whether the advantage outweighs the negative for producing viable offspring. Also, once again, evolution doesn't work on goals. ""Being faster is good"" doesn't mean that species will just evolve methods to being faster. That's just not how it works.

&gt; Now the lion can also evolve. It loves to eat zebra which are not particularly fast. Again, it wouldn't take much, compared to the convergent evolution of echolocation, for evolution to make the lion slightly better at catching zebra.

Once again, we have someone ignorant of evolution arguing that something should be easy, or comparably easier, to evolve to do something. What if lions simply became scavengers? Or waited to trap zebras? There's no goal to evolution, so whatever advantage outweighs the negatives wins out.

&gt; So the lions then eats all the zebra. All zebra are now gone. It can't catch the implala so then it starves. All lion are now gone. All we have are impala.

A very simplistic thought idea, but if the zebra can't reproduce enough to sustain their population, then yes, they will go extinct. But before this happens, there will be fewer lions to feast on them because there will be less food to feed the lions, if all they got to feast on were zebra. So there would be an equilibrium that would form before either were to be wiped out, and something else would need to affect one of their populations to push them over the edge to extinction.

&gt; The point of this is that it's very easy for minor changes to disrupt complex ecosystems and result in very simple ones.

Somehow this ""complex ecosystem"" consisting of one predator and two prey species collapses with a simple change, that is, lions overeating the only one of the two prey they could catch. That's not very complex and it's a bad argument to make.

Claim #2:

""Secondly, this [post] led me to consider DNA's error checking and repair mechanisms.""

Oh, boy... And the [post] does not link anywhere as of the time of posting this.

&gt; How is it, that evolution which depends on random mutations, would evolve mechanisms that try to prevent any mutations from occurring at all?

Because too many errors would be a huge issue for a system which requires replication? However, nothing is perfect, and for humans, even with billions of base pairs in a single genome, over 100 errors get through when forming gametes. Imagine if there was no system of correction how bad that would get?

&gt; The theory of evolution cannot exist without mutations driving change, so why and how would random mutations end up creating complex nanomachines that try to eliminate all mutations.

The ""why"" assumes there's a purpose to it rather than chemistry being chemistry. And just because something tries to do something doesn't mean it will always succeed at it. A working, replicating living cell would continue living if it kept replicating perfectly, as long as it did not need to adapt to any environment. But chemistry doesn't always work the exact way every time (due to external forces interacting with chemical reactions) so sometimes errors creep in. Now we have variations in those organisms. Some bad. Some good. Most do nothing toward the fitness of the organism.

&gt; This doesn't make sense to me.

Perhaps because you refuse to learn about evolution from reputable sources and keep insisting creationism must be true?",116,1578456248,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elncx1/rcreation_two_logical_issues_with_evolution_or/

What could explain his results?,"Mark Armitage has claimed he has found further evidence of the young age of dinosaur fossils.

&gt;Armitage starts showing several structures that he interprets as axons. Scientists who are committed to these fossils being millions of years old dismiss such structures as remnants of fungi that have contaminated the fossil. However, fungal remnants have specific characteristics, and Armitage does tests to show that the structures he interprets as axons don’t have those characteristics. Instead, they have the characteristics expected of axons! Indeed, he shows images from another scientist that demonstrate how axons from a mouse behave under specific conditions, and then he shows that one of the structures he interprets as an axon from a dinosaur behaves in a similar way.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most stunning image in the video is the one I show at the top of this article. The image shows what appears to be the sections of myelin that wrap an axon as well as the nodes of Ranvier that exist in between those sections. The arrows point out where the myelin wrappings end and the nodes of Ranvier begin. If these results are confirmed, they represent the first time anyone has isolated soft axons from a dinosaur fossil! Based on what I have seen, I think Armitage makes a very strong case, so I expect the results to be confirmed.

What could possibly explain this?

DebateEvolution,elfw8g,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"RE: Pseudogenes, this WILL come up, so let's get it out of the way now, because it doesn't say what creationists will claim it says.","New commentary in Nature.

(Don't get me started on Nature. Suffice it to say you should always double check work published there. But this isn't experimental work, it's a ""perspective"", so that caveat doesn't apply.)

&amp;nbsp;

If I were a betting man, I'd say that within a day or two, we're going to see a creationist post something along the lines of ""more biologists acknowledging creationist prediction of functional pseudogenes is accurate"", using this paper as proof.

And when that happens, invite said creationist to chill and read what those authors are saying. 

They are *not* saying ""junk DNA"" doesn't exist. 

They are *not* saying all, or even most, DNA is functional.

They are *not* saying pseudogenes (sequences derived from previously protein-coding regions that are no longer protein-coding) don't exist. 

&amp;nbsp;

They *are* saying that the term ""pseudogene"" is applied to broadly during genome annotation, without sufficient experimental support, and should be applied much more narrowly. Specifically, for regions derived from fully functional (i.e. transcribed, translated, and active) genes:

Retro-transposed coding regions and truncated coding regions, if translated, should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. (I think these should just be called ""genes"". That's the word for a transcribed and translated region of DNA. Pretty simple.)

Transcribed but non-translated regions should not be classified as pseudogenes by default, and should be evaluated on the basis of the activity of the resulting RNA - some have a regulatory function. (Although I think they go too far in the other direction here, and that non-translated RNAs should be in the ""maybe functional, maybe not"" box until each one is specifically checked experimentally.)

Non-transcribed regions that affect chromatin packaging should not be classified as pseudogenes by default. The authors describe how some may be involved in gene regulation via chromatin remodeling. (I think they also go a bit far here, and this affect on chromatin is basically incidental, and that the nearby genes have basically evolved around their genomic neighbors. So remove or modify the neighbors, and the regulation of the genes themselves are messed up. But that doesn't make the neighboring regions ""functional"".)

And finally, they describe two sets of things that can happen to pseudogenes which causes them to be associated with disease: recombination and copy-number variation. I think this is the weakest evidence for functions of the pseudogene regions. Basically, they aren't doing much until there is too much or it's in the wrong place. That's not showing they're functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I have my quibbles with some of what the authors say, but overall I think they make a reasonable point: The term ""pseudogene"" has been applied too widely, to most gene-derived sequences that don't do ""everything"" a gene does (and in some cases, to sequences that *do* do all of those thing, i.e. are genes in the traditional sense), even though at least some of these sequences are probably functional (i.e. contribute affirmatively to cell physiology). 

So be skeptical when you see creationists try to twist this paper to say something it doesn't. 

Or when they do, remind them that pseudogenes are about 1.2% of the human genome, so if *every single one* was functional, that would inch the needle up to about 11% functionality in the human genome. A far cry from ""at least 80% of the genome is functional"" or whatever insane number they use now.",7,1578423478,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/elfw8g/re_pseudogenes_this_will_come_up_so_lets_get_it/

Just wanted to get thoughts on how a creationist might respond to those arguments and any criticisms or suggestions DE frequenters would have. 

Arguments:

We have very strong evidence for common descent in recent animals (microevolution acc. to many creationists). A portion of this evidence is weaker, but contributes to and is present among the whole of the evidence. This weaker evidence is present for extinct animals which may have much further removed proposed evolutionary relationships (macroevolution acc. to those same creationists). Our observations supported by strong evidence justify that this weaker evidence indicates evolution, while we have no evidence that it indicates anything creationist models propose. This counts in favor of evolution as the better explanation for all the weaker evidence we see. 

A wide variety of geological and physical processes we observe today are gradual processes that would take many thousands to millions of years to result in earth as we see today. If a young earth or a flood model were to account for these features, it would require a large number of significant coincidences to account for all of these processes at once. Our models which require fewer coincidences, all else equal, are better than models that require more. This counts in favor of old earth and non-flood models of geology as better than young earth and flood models of geology. 

Barimonology can only be a successful model of phylogeny for creationists if humans and primates are separate barims. Any methodology used to identify barims will: include expected and strongly evidenced clades, but include humans as primates; or separate humans and primates, but also separate expected and strongly evidenced clades as separate barims. There are no other successful models of phylogeny for creationists. For universal common descent, however, there are successful models of phylogeny. The best explanations for our observations, all else equal, will be successful models. This counts in favor of universal common descent as a better model of phylogeny than any creationist account. 

How might you expect a creationist respond to these? 

Any questions about the arguments? 

Any criticisms of the arguments? 

Any suggestions for the arguments?

Probably more important, what are some empirical sources I can use to verify some of the premises I'm defending?  It wouldn't be too hard to resort to waffling around the issues addressed if there are no hard obstacles presented.  In particular, I think examples of very clearly related animals alive today (elephants is an example I've seen before) would be very valuable for the explanation of weak evidence and problems with barimonology.  I especially need fossil evidence and the methodology used for recent evolutionary lines we have good accounts of, as this would allow comparison with more ancient evolution (although I expect this could be hard to find).",8,1578373530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/el6q33/developing_arguments_against_creation_model/

[This page (scroll down)](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna-predictions) by u/johnberea is an example. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9per4c/what_are_some_papers_you_can_site_showing_the/e87473w/) with u/br56u7, who is a YEC, is another. Thus John does a back-of-a-fag-packet calculation to conclude that if humans were created six million years ago, a diploid genome should have degraded from 100% to 88% functional.

A rather fun counter-argument to this is that plenty of intuitive ""kinds"" have a fantastically long existence in the fossil record without seeming to suffer any appreciable consequence of this phenomenon.

Crocodilians and Crocodyliformes have existed continuously since at least the late Cretaceous and early Jurassic, respectively. Take [this beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcosuchus) for instance.

Let’s give it 120 million years.

The relevant parametres are similar to those of humans. Neutral substitution rate of [7.9 x 10^(-9) per site per generation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4386873/). Genome size of 2-3 gigabases. Generation time around 20 years. So extrapolating a 12% loss every 6 million years to 120 million years gives me 0.88^20=0.078 functional or a loss of 92.2% of the original function of the genome.

Unless I’m missing something, by u/johnberea’s calculations crocodiles are seriously fucked. Except that [they’re very much still around](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/45433088/3010181).

DebateEvolution,ek7oot,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"A question for the creationists, hopefully leading to nice chill discussion for a change.","I have a few questions for creationists about the life of plants and the great flood.  This is a question for creationists who believe in both the global flood, and micro evolution is the only form of evolution. This is clearly not trying to be too serious a conversation, yet I would like to take is seriously enough to avoid answering the questions by ‘magic’.


Before I ask the question, we have to agree on a few things:

1.	Flood waters would be brackish due to the salinity of the ocean. This would result in a large change to soil chemistry.


2.	Aquatic plants and terrestrial plants are of different kinds as they live in very different environments. Following this logic plants that can survive in saline rich vs non saline rich soil are different kinds. (As I’ve never read a concrete definition of a kind, these are the kinds for this conversation). 


3. To the best of my knowledge, terrestrial plants are unable to survive for 40 days under brackish water (this is a testable hypothesis, I’d love to be shown I’m wrong). Therefore, during the flood all of the terrestrial plants would have likely perished.

4. When the flood waters receded, soil chemistry would have been altered due to being covered with brackish (or straight saline water) water.

5. Aquatic plants didn’t recolonize the land, see point 2.



The Noah’s Ark story makes a big deal about Noah and his family gathering up two animals of every kind for the ark. I’ll admit I’m far from an expert on the story, but I’ve never heard of Noah et al. gathering up every kind of terrestrial (and some aquatic plants depends on the chemistry of the flood waters). But because I want to have good faith conversation I’ll be generous and extend an olive branch and allow Noah to have a massive seed stock of all of the plants on earth. With that said his seed stock would be useless due to changes in soil chemistry (Points 1 and 2).



So my questions are as follows. 

1. If God repopulated the earth with similar plants, (that were magically able to live in saline rich soil) where did our plants that live in non-saline rich soil come from?  

2. How did Noah’s small family desalinate the ground rapidly enough to feed not only themselves, but all of the animals on the Ark. What methods did they use to desalinate the grounds using the very limited technology available at the time, how did the cover the entire earth?  We should see a small break in the fossil record on remote areas of land and isolated regions.

3. If God magically pulled all of the salt out of the ground and repopulated the entire earth with plants, why did he require a 600 year old man undergo the arduous task of building an ark and gathering up the animals when he could have simply repopulating the earth with animals? Clearly God was interested in saving Noah, not the animals as he let nearly every animal die and there were no specific instructions about 'moral' animals.

Be kind to one another, as long as people are here in good faith be reasonable with your down votes.

But Creationists use genetic similarity as evidence for Common Design. Okay, it fits with their narrative but that being said we have actual, actionable evidence that common DNA=common descent. Even if it were evidence of common design, common descent should take priority as an explanation shouldnt it (in the same way thst a person could slip and fall on a knife, but if a bloodstained guy is nearby trying to escape its probably murder)

DebateEvolution,eisps0,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Vivek_david_law says that I lied about Hells Creek being non-marine.,"I’m disappointed you didn’t tag me so I can defend my post vivek_david_law.

[You called me a liar](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eirg13/dishonesty_of_debateevolution_hells_creek_marine/) when I made the case that Hell Creek is a non-marine deposit.  I’m once again forced to return to the discussion. 

Excuse the large amounts of quotes. I’m letting the [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation) page and this [New Yorker]( https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) article that Vivek linked to speak for themselves. I'm really not interested in revisiting this topic, but I won't stand idly by when called a liar.

I included links to both articles I’ve copied quotes from so you can ensure I’m not quote mining.

Vivek_david_law:

&gt;So what was found in hells creek? Was it animals from rivers with brackish waters overflowing. Well a quick glance at the hells creek Wikipedia page says that along with fish, they also found sharks, octopuses, sea turtles and marine retitles like the mosasaur. So quick question for r/debateevolution - do sea turtles live in rivers or do they live in the ocean? Do we expect sea turtles from flooding rivers with brackish waters - or would that be consistent with a flood?


Why go to the Wikipedia page when I cited my data from a peer reviewed paper?  But I’ll indulge you, here are some other quotes from the Wikipedia page.

&gt;[Hell’s Creek] is a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited…

&gt;The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the Fort Peck area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat, forested floodplainwith a relatively subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to conifers such as the bald cypress, ferns and ginkgos. The Hell Creek Formation was laid down by streams, on a coastal plain along the edge of the Western Interior Seaway. The presence of crocodilia suggests climate was subtropical; there was no cold season and probably ample precipitation.

&gt;At the time, this region had a subtropical, warm and moist climate. The climate was humid, with flowering plants, conifers, palmettos, and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, canopy, understory plants, ash trees, live oak and shrubs in the forests. In northwestern South Dakota, strips of black layers deposited in the wetland environment are rich in coal, and a bright band-like layer of sand and mud from the river floodplain accumulated.

&gt;A broad coastal plain extended westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone which have been attributed to floodplain, fluvial, lacustrine, swamp, estuarine and coastal plainenvironments.


This is exactly what I said, there were forests, and river near an inland sea. Some how you missed all of this while reading the wiki article.

Next you cited an article in the New Yorker. In the interest of fairness I’ll only quote from sources you provided. 

&gt;At the time of the [Chicxulub impact event], the Hell Creek landscape consisted of steamy, subtropical lowlands and floodplains along the shores of an inland sea. The land teemed with life and the conditions were excellent for fossilization, with seasonal floods and meandering rivers that rapidly buried dead animals and plants.

&gt;One paleontologist estimated that in the Cretaceous period Hell Creek was so thick with T. rexes that they were like hyenas on the Serengeti. It was also home to triceratops and duckbills.

Last I checked T-Rexes are terrestrial dinosaurs. 

&gt;In 2004, DePalma, at the time a twenty-two-year-old paleontology undergraduate, began excavating a small site in the Hell Creek Formation. The site had once been a pond, and the deposit consisted of very thin layers of sediment. Normally, one geological layer might represent thousands or millions of years. But DePalma was able to show that each layer in the deposit had been laid down in a single big rainstorm. “We could see when there were buds on the trees,” he told me. “We could see when the cypresses were dropping their needles in the fall. We could experience this in real time.” 




You linked to the article to support the following argument:

&gt;I'm not the only one surprised by salt and freshwater species with land mammals being found at hells creek. While r/DebateEvolution pretends this is normal and unquestioned, here is a non-creation scientist saying that they are perplexed by the finding in the New Yorker


The New Yorker article explains your findings in the following paragraph:

&gt;“When I saw that, I knew this wasn’t just any flood deposit,” DePalma said. “We weren’t just near the KT boundary—this whole site is the KT boundary!” From surveying and mapping the layers, DePalma hypothesized that a massive inland surge of water flooded a river valley and filled the low-lying area where we now stood, perhaps as a result of the KT-impact tsunami, 


There are many more quotes I can take from the article that discuss a non-marine environment, but I think I’ve argued my case.

Finally you linked to an article that discusses a tsunami at the KT boundary. This was already discussed above so I see no need to expand on my argument. 

The Wikipedia page states that deposition of the Hells Creek Formation took 2 million years. This two million years included a tsunami caused by the Chicxulub impact event. This tsunami mixed up terrestrial and marine organism. 

That does NOT mean that is was a non-marine environment for long periods of time. The ample amount of non-marine fossils speak for themselves.",70,1577936318,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/eisps0/vivek_david_law_says_that_i_lied_about_hells/

DebateEvolution,eh4ytp,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"The issue isn't science it's philosophy! Okay, u/vivek_david_law, philosophise me this one.","&gt;What I realized from reading the posts, and from reading a lot of the posts on r/debateevolution is the problem for YEC is not a scientific conundrum. 

&gt;...

&gt;We don't even apply philosophy to basic philosophical questions, we think it's a waste of time.

&gt;This is a new modern development, and I think it's the source of this apparent science Young Earth conflict.

This is an amazing claim made on r/creation by u/vivek_david_law.

Unsurprisingly, the rest of his post is full of some quite extraordinary generalities (""often rejected by scientists"", that kind of thing), so let's get down to one very specific empirical case.

I'm going to return to u/denisova's chart, expanded with other measurements from the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary.

25 different analyses using three different isotopes with different halflives, from several locations and performed independently by several laboratories, wouldn't have been in agreement if there had been something fundamentally wrong with radiodating. If they were off by say, five orders of magnitude, as YECs believe. Of if, as you yourself said, we're (incorrectly) assuming ""that we know the way radioactive isotopes form and dissipate over long periods of time"".

This is a simple empirical test of the two theories, Old Earth vs Young Earth. The only assumption it makes is that a theory with predictive power (Old Earth: these methods should agree) is superior to a theory without predictive power (Young Earth: there is no intrinsic reason why these methods should agree).

So, u/vivek_david_law, if you think the empirical science isn't the issue and it's all about philosophy, **please give me a philosophical YEC interpretation of the same data.** I'm all ears.

Please don't downvote answers people.

I don't recall every seeing this before, so let's do it. I'm not going to comprehensively address each item, but I will group them thematically. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#1 is just 0_o...change in allele frequencies is the literal definition of evolution. We can observe this happening. Therefore evolution happens. There's a phrase: ""Microevolution"" is the evolution creationists can't deny, ""macroevolution"" is the evolution creationists must deny."" This is the former, so they go on to say ""but this isn't *really* evolution."" &lt;shruggie&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

\#2 is literally something I teach in the ""common misconceptions"" section of my 200-level evolution class.

&amp;nbsp;

\#3-5 and 7-11 are strawmen. Nobody says any of those things ""prove"" evolution. They are *examples* of evolutionary change, and *evidence* for evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#6 The scientific consensus *is* that evolution is true, but nobody says ""there's consensus, *therefore* evolution is true."" The causality goes the other way. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#12 and \#19-20 go together. Depending on how you make a design argument, it's either unfalsifiable, or false. ""Bad design"" doesn't really come into it, except to undermine some of the clumsily-stated falsifiable versions. It's often framed in religious, rather than scientific terms, and the modern, US-based ID movement, in addition to generally promoting an unfalsifiable idea of biological design, is an explicitly religious movement. Which has no bearing on the validity of the underlying idea, but turned out to be a liability in court. All of this is irrelevant to the validity of evolutionary theory, since disproving one idea does not automatically validate a competing idea. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#13: Biogeography *does* support evolution. It's *what led to evolutionary theory*. Both Darwin and Wallace were primarily engaged in biogeography, and Wallace is considered the father of the field.

&amp;nbsp;

\#14: Abiogenesis is a separate theory, and falling back to ""but evolution doesn't explain the origins of life!"" is a goal-post move. That being said, there's a robust and ever-growing body of evidence for abiogenesis, so biologists shouldn't shy away from the topic when it comes up. If creationists want to die on that hill instead of evolution, fine with me. 

&amp;nbsp;

\#15-18 are things nobody uses to defend evolutionary theory, and I'm reasonably confident these aren't real arguments scientists make. I'd be more confidence, but I can't read literally every argument anyone ever makes on these issues, so I can't be sure. I haven't personally encountered them. They range from unreasonable to laughable. Has the author of this piece ever, I don't know, *asked biologist what the arguments for evolution are*? Or are they just making things up?

&amp;nbsp;

\#21 is irrelevant to the question of the validity of evolutionary theory.

If I wanted to know what happened to them I could simply ask him when I arrived in heaven. I was taught nothing could have lived 65 million years ago because God created all land animals and man on the 6th day of creation. I remember being taught in the 3rd grade that the Earth and universe were both 6,000 years old. This timeline was established in 1650 CE by James Ussher, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh. He studied the Bible and tracked back the time and date of creation to be approximately 6 pm on October 22, 4004 BCE. In a small classroom in 1997 my young mind was being taught the same thing and I believed it. I had no reason to doubt it, after all, I was in school and this was an adult telling me this. I was never taught about the alternative theories. Anytime I would hear anything remotely contradicting the ""Young Earth"" belief I would do as I was told: ignore it.

&amp;nbsp;
You may want to re-read that sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;
I think the debate of TOBE is very [salubrious](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/salubrious). The essence of scientific inquiry is to establish a cause for a given affect.

&amp;nbsp;
When I use the phrase, ""present-day complex bodies,"" that is ***exactly*** the affect (result) that TOBE requires.  ***That's*** not negotiable. The only uncertainty is to the precise complexity. The contemporary discoveries about the human genome, for example, are a genuine examples of complexity. What's preposterous to me is that ""genetic mutation"", ***random or otherwise*** is the mechanism of change that explains the vast physical transformation from a simplistic organism into a present-day complex organism.

&amp;nbsp;
Please note that ""random or otherwise"" means that ***that*** point can be set aside while there's discussion of ""genetic mutation,"" the change mechanism. Natural selection--I've been silent about that, so far--is the ***other*** main tenet, it not being a ""mechanism."" In this sense, natural selection is of the same type of effect as Gravity; and, as we know , [""Gravity always wins""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yw6NKIczZg)",47,1577029235,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ee67bk/on_the_importance_of_debate_over_our_subject/
DebateEvolution,ee2o1i,ThurneysenHavets,,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Evolution isn’t real, unless it’s decades-scale hyper-evolution on steroids... some specific examples from the historical record.","Today’s “kinds”, in the YEC view, descend from a single couple on the ark (ca. 2300 BCE), which evolved into the many different species we see today, over the course of four thousand years.

Enter, however, a lovely little thing called the historical record, which seriously fucks with this theory.

The fact that modern animals are frequently attested, as far as records go (which is pretty much right up to the Tower of Babel, about a century post-flood, if you’re a YEC), with *the physical and behavioral characteristics of modern animals*, is strong evidence against this YEC model.

This post gives some specific examples of where the historical and archaeological record further constrains already implausible YEC micro-evolution narrative. I’m putting it here for reference. It shows that creationists have, at best, a century or two to play with for many of the kinds they postulate.

(Note: creationists can’t agree on their own bullshit revisionist timelines, so I usually haven’t tried to translate real dates into YEC dates. But these would all have to be a matter of a few centuries at most.)

**Evidence for divergence of the cat kind**

All [one species on the ark](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/), around 2300 BCE. Yet we find, among many other things...

- An extremely clear picture of a lion from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, conventionally around 2550 BCE (figure 8 [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/artifacts-royal-cemetery-of-ur-171678)).

- Pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egyptian tombs containing remains of both wild cats and leopards. See [here](https://www.thegreatcat.org/cat-domestication-continued-the-mostagedda-tomb-hierakonpolis/), [here](https://archive.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html) and [here](http://www.hierakonpolis-online.org/index.php/explore-the-predynastic-cemeteries/hk6-elite-cemetery).

- A Proto-Sumerian (conventionally 3000 BCE) [depiction of a leopard](https://phoenixancientart.com/work-of-art/mesopotamian-statuette-of-a-leopard/)

So that’s a conventional 15.2 million years (lion/domestic cat on timetree.org) compressed into a few centuries max.

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the sheep kind**

- Ancient Sumerian texts from third millennium B.C.E. [distinguish between sheep and goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_between_sheep_and_grain).

- [Summary of early attestation of goats](https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/goats-in-the-ancient-near-east-and-their-relationship-with-the-mythology-fairytale-and-folklore-of-t).

- Extensive [archaeological evidence](https://www.academia.edu/2590017/Sheep-_and_-Goats-Mesopotamia-domestication-_and_-secondary-products) for sheep and goats, stretching deep into prehistory.

- The Proto-Indo-European lexemes for [sheep](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%82%C3%B3wis) and [goat](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/b%CA%B0u%C7%B5-) are reconstructible, requiring these animals to have existed when PIE was spoken. Creationists tend to assume PIE was spoken immediately after the Tower of Babel, which would give just over a century for the divergence.

Instead of 9.75 million years (sheep/goat on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for equid divergence **

- An 18th century BCE text distinguishing between [horse and mule](http://imh.org/exhibits/online/legacy-of-the-horse/riding-comes-near-east-1350-bce/).

- The notion of the donkey as stubborn (inaccurate, but the stereotype is based on actual behaviour traits of this equid which *differ* from horse traits) dates back at least to Sumerian [texts from 2100-1800 B.C.E.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/598273.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A63fea475e6409e83e7bb2eb0e5c5ceb4)

- Donkey remains from [early dynastic Egypt](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3715).

Particularly interesting is the fact that mules (horse-donkey hybrids) have been infertile since as far as our historical records go. Even where it is not otherwise stated it can be inferred from their market value, as outlined [here](https://books.google.be/books?id=vUIoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Sumerian+price+of+mule&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHWaex_zy1&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CQj8yxR88OiaJjetrB-PapKOBLg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZx86IlK_mAhWvxoUKHR90DQMQ6AEwDnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20price%20of%20mule&amp;f=false); the fact that mules were so expensive is reflective of the fact that they could not simply be bred.

This is further significant in that deliberately breeding hybrids suggests some experience in equid domestication. By any reasonable scenario, therefore, this pushes horse-onager and horse-donkey divergence even further back. We're presumably playing with decades here. Instead of a conventional 7.7 million years (horse/donkey on timetree.org).

-----

**Evidence for divergence in the eagle kind**.

[“Includes hawks, but also kites, harriers, eagles, and Old World vultures.”]( https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-of-avian-ark-kinds/)

- Ancient Sumerians [depicted the eagle](https://books.google.be/books?id=aH-Aq6oF5uoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=eagle+sumeria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xLon2oQ9Gq&amp;sig=ACfU3U1P398gVF7eefpMvqx1Qbk_4wey7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8nc-LnK_mAhXCxYUKHXKlDNMQ6AEwFnoECA4QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eagle%20sumeria&amp;f=false).

- The identification of black kites from the [Egyptian fifth dynasty](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40345840?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) is based on their behaviour as well as their appearance.

- Extremely clear depiction of the [Egyptian vulture from 2600 BCE](https://www.lifegyptianvulture.it/en/the-egyptian-vulture/).

That makes, again, a few centuries max instead of conventional 31 million years (eagle/kite on timetree.org). 

-----

On a side note, I must say I never realised just *how* brazenly amateurish baraminology was:

&gt;When hybrid data is lacking, a cognitum approach is preferred; this identifies natural groupings based on human cognitive senses

So a smart creationist might try to rescue the creationist view by saying they’ve just messed up the kinds and those kinds are actually multiple kinds.

But then again, on the flip side of the coin, you have to fit all these animals onto a wooden ship that’s already too big to be seaworthy as described in the Bible.

However, what I think is interesting is how he does not see a natural explanation, and so it must be a primal instinct. I don't know if it would take that long to show how adaptive that is. I mean, if someone is in danger, it is adaptive to believe that they are saved, or something.

&gt; I see neither any scientific nor compelling other reasons to dispute the conventional dating of the age of the universe and Earth, or the conventional explanations for the origin of the geological column and the fossil record. I also consider so-called Flood Geology of Young Earth Creationists as a totally failed endeavor.

https://www.bechly.at/anti-darwinism-1/

Michael Behe

&gt; Although in Darwin’s Black Box, Behe confessed that he had “no reason to doubt that the universe is billions of years old,” and that he had “no particular reason to doubt” common descent (p. 5), such comments were few and far between. Some Bible-believing scientists, trying to give Behe the benefit of the doubt, speculated that, perhaps such “brief, sporadic comments...were intended to make the book more marketable” (see Major, 1996). (It was, after all, made available by a major publishing company—Simon &amp; Schuster.) What’s more, “Behe’s arguments stand without any reference to the age issue” (Major).

&gt; Christians have much less about which to be excited in Behe’s latest book, The Edge of Evolution. Sadly, it is riddled with unscriptural, unprovable, even irreverent statements. First, Behe repeatedly gives credence to the evolutionary geologic timetable. He writes about fish that he believes have been around for “ten million years” (2007, p. 16), and how “perhaps a trillion creatures have preceded us [humans—EL] in the past ten million years” (p. 60). Behe even goes so far as to suggest that life has been on Earth for “the past several billion years” (p. 19). The fact is, Behe’s thoughts contradict holy writ: God created “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” in six days (Exodus 20:11)—thousands, not billions, of years ago (cf. Mark 10:6; Luke 11:49-51; Romans 1:20; see also Lyons, 2006).

Any thoughts? 

&gt; This analysis of de novo origination in the genus Oryza detected critical evidence in both ancestral non-coding origination and 
translational products of de novo genes. We identified at least 175 candidate de novo genes with significantly similar ancestral non-coding sequences, implicating an unexpectedly high rate 
(51.5 de novo genes per Myr) of generation and retention of de novo genes in the genomes of young Oryza species compared with reported lower numbers of de novo genes in metazoans1,2,16–29 and 
plants12–15. These observations show that de novo genes are important in the evolution of protein diversity in Oryza. These data reveal the power of evolution in natural populations in the generation 
of de novo genes that arise from non-coding sequences, probably via various possible molecular processes over time54,68, compared with artificial synthesis and selection69,70. We also note that the observed high rate of de novo gene generation and retention in the recent evolution of Oryza might have been in equilibrium with the loss of unrelated genes in genome evolution, as was previously detected in cereal species33. We anticipate that, whether or not such dynamics of gene evolution can be extrapolated beyond the Oryza genus backwards to farther ancestral lineages of Poaceae, monocots and angiosperms will be an important problem to explore in the future.

It's so weird how creationists keep harping on Haeckel's fraudulent embryos as if it presents a formidable challenge to the theory of evolution. Please, enough. Every single biologist worth their weight in salt recognizes this fraud. Even if ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" was a hypothesis worth investigating, Haeckel forged many of his drawings.

Research on embryology into the early twentieth century delved deeper into development, and the boom of molecular biology was so loud that many textbooks just didn't remove this flaw (i.e. Homeobox genes, ""hedgehog"" genes, etc.). But the fact that it is wrong does not discount the interpretation of embryological development through the lens of evolutionary history.

Human embryos have pharyngeal gill slits (like all **chordates**\--cladistic term--have at some point in their life cycle). Duh. That's telling of human evolutionary history. But the theory doesn't always hold. There is no bacterial stage in the development of the zygote. There. An ""evolutionist"" has admitted that ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny. Done.

And of course, /u/PaulDouglasPrice lies through his teeth.

&gt;So this is more or less a question for anybody who happens to work in (or is familiar with) the field of genetics in any capacity:

Then don't try a closed creationist subreddit.

&gt;Are you aware of any discussion going on behind the scenes about genetic entropy? Is there any frank discussion going on, say, in population genetics, for example, about how all the published models of mutation effects predict decline? That there is no biologically realistic simulation or model that would actually predict an overall increase in fitness over time?

None of this is true.

&gt;What about the fact that John Sanford helped create the most biologically-realistic model of evolution ever, Mendel's Accountant? And of course, this program shows clearly that decline happens over time when you put in the realistic parameters of life.

Mendel's Accountant is frighteningly flawed, but of course, PDP is completely unqualified to recognize that.

Did you know that there are *no* values that you can put into Mendel's Accountant which is stable? You can make positive mutations exceedingly common and the population's fitness still collapses.

This suggests something is **very wrong** with his simulation.

&gt;Darwinian evolution is fundamentally broken at the genetic level. The math obviously doesn't work, so how do the researchers manage to keep a straight face while still paying lip service to Darwin?

Because saying it is a lot different than proving it, you still have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;According to Sanford's own testimony on the matter, his findings have been met with nothing but silence from the genetics community (a community of which Sanford himself is an illustrious member, having achieved high honors and distinguished himself as an inventor). He believes they are actively attempting to avoid this issue entirely because they know it is so problematic for them.

Yes, because Sanford is completely discredited. His entire theory is nonsense.",98,1576518433,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ebif5i/pdp_asks_unqualified_laymen_is_genetic_entropy/

(1998) suggested that the Hell Creek is among the most fossiliferous and carefully studied Upper Cretaceous nonmarine deposits in the world.

Creationist horse manure strikes once again. /u/nomenmeum posted [this]( https://www.thebereancall.org/content/marine-fossils-mixed-hell-creek-dinosaurs) steaming pile of lies at /r/creation. 

There are two lies that I want to discuss. 

First:
&gt;Hell Creek itself is claimed to be terrestrial solely because it contains dinosaur fossils. But it’s filled with marine fossils from top to bottom.

Second:
&gt;Spinosaurus, the largest theropod dinosaur ever discovered, was found in Morocco with car-size fossils of coelacanth fish, which today are only found in the deep ocean.

We’ll tackle the lies in reveres order.

First the Spinosaurus in the paper cited by the creationist ‘journal’ states:

&gt;These adaptations suggest that Spinosaurus was primarily a piscivore, subsisting on sharks, sawfish, coelacanths, lungfish, and actinopterygians that were common in the Kem Kem river system.

I’m not a geographer, but last I checked rivers are non-marine.

Secondly, on the 23rd of December 1938, Captain Hendrick Goosen caught a species of Coelacanth in the [Tyolomnqa river]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth#cite_note-Smith-6) in South Africa. 

So we have the implication of a lie, followed by an outright lie.


Now to the true heart of the matter, Hells Creek Formation (HCF).

There is a lot of evidence that large areas of HCF was non-marine for a long period of time, so I’m going to list of 6 pieces of evidence followed by a brief discussion. All of my evidence comes from ‘Lithostratigraphy of the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota’ by Edward C. Murphy, John W. Hoganson, and Kirk R. Johnson. The paper was originally published in Geological Society of America in 2002. You can access it yourself at DOI: 10.1130/0-8137-2361-2.9.

1.	Paleosols have been found in HCF, these of fossilized soil horizons.  Soil takes long periods to form.

2.	Fossilized pine cones and many other varieties of plants and roots have been been found in the HCF.

3.	Rivers that have flooded their banks are present in the geological record of the HCF.

4.	‘Fossilized Popcorn weathering’ that is weather than occurs when clays water content changes, most commonly found today in the badlands. 

5.	Fresh water mollusks, and many other non-marine fossils (including dinosaurs) have been found in HCF.

6.	Coal deposits are present. 

I think that list shows that there were long periods time were the HCF was non-marine. If you have any question about any of pieces of evidence please ask. Due to the proximity of the Western Interior seaway, parts of the HCF were brackish and there are layers of marine sediment, but that doesn’t mean that dinosaurs swam out to see and drowned. It simply means sea level was changing. There is ample evidence to support a non-marine ecosystems existed during the HCF epoch. The creationists even agree agrees with my findings:

&gt;The data show multiple examples of mixed land, freshwater, and marine influences in the upper HCF. These results mesh well with the marine influence found in North Dakota.


You’ll note that the authors stop just short of using this as evidence for the Noachian flood, they strongly implied it stating that the finding of marine fossils didn’t surprise ~~flood geologists~~ creationists. Yet there is abundant evidence free for anyone to check out that simply proves that a single flooding even did not occur (at least during the same time period as the deposition of HCF, nor any other time, but this is only evidence for this time).


To those of you in /r/creation who are upset that once again, a lurker from /r/debateevolution is create their own parallel post and vent their hatred and scoffing [at /r/debateevolution]. I have a simple one step solution. You should have no problems following it, it’s one of your (for the Christians at least) 10 commandments.

STOP TELLING LIES.

One of the reasons I fell in love with geology is you can do a lot of it for nearly free. Getting to the study area is generally the hardest part. Any one of us can travel to HCF and see the paleosols, see the fossilized popcorn weathering, and the pine cones and other plant matter. It’s all there for anyone to see. 

Posts with lies like these are toxic, we literally owe our modern lifestyle to science, and you hand wave it away. Remember next time you need antibiotics, or eat a vegetable, or fill your car with gas, many years of science has been done in the background so you can do those things. These are the same fields that have contributed to the theory of evolution. You man not believe evolution is real, but you are quick to reap the material rewards of the same fields of science. 

Stop living in the past, and most importantly, STOP TELLING LIES and I guarantee we’ll stop ~~creating [our] own parallel posts and vent [our] hatred and scoffing~~ calling you out for your bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the flaw in basic thinking is that you assume that what you see as a red shift demonstrates ""Evidence"" for a bing bang therefore in your puny minds bing bang happened ergo evolution.

How do you know that what you call the unvierse isnt just a SINGLE atom or cell in a much HIGHER dimension that we couldnt even begin to see or imagine.

How could you observe that your just living in a SINGLE cell that is called the Universe?

We are so puny we could NEVER know this, not to mention, just like time or speed is considered relative, so is size. Size is relative as well. We dont know whether or not our universe isnt just a SINGLE atom or Cell that is just as random as the atoms in our observable universe and that it gets its randomness by the randomness of the atoms in our universe that combines into the randomness of the atom which is called our observable universe.

&amp;#x200B;

When you take these things into account, it becomes difficult to accept evolotion because evolution becomes yet another fallacy in logic that humans who know NOTHING about life and existence tend to make. I would wager millions of dollars that the MAJORITY of people who believe in evolution do so simply JUST to avoid the ridicule that EVERYONE tends to get when they dispute the theory. Name one person that DOESNT get insults and hate for trying to go against this theory. It truly is so carefully protected and just watch how everyone that posts here will go off with the insults or the nonsense just because they HATE when somoene goes against their theory. THey use the fallacy of logic saying that ""majority of scientists believe it ergo its true"" when its NOT. No one can explain what our Universe is at all, so if you dont know what the universe is, how could you explain its origin or the origin of life?

Im not here trying to say that based on what I say, the only truth must be Creation. My point is, no one can know, so lets instead spend time on ACTUAL REAL science that can be observed and ALWAYS tested in a lab with 100% success rate which is what REAL SCIENCE is. Dont give me your opinions on how we got here based on some flimsy evidence and your desperate attempt to deduce how things happened.   


The moron who before evolution or even Darwin, aka Charles Lyell, came up with the geologic column and applied his own arbitrary dates to layers of rock before any form of radiometric dating existed, and people took his word and believed it with NO PROOF or any EVIDENCE, why? simply because at that time the climate was such that people didnt want a King and especially didnt want God. The fallacy humans make today is to think they are Gods, they are all knowing, and they dont need a God and can do everything themselves, so they will believe whatever they want to just so they can have some way or reason or excuse to disregard a creator.

&amp;#x200B;

Again Im not for creation nor evolution. I simply live my life. I came here on an alt account because on my main account I noticed that after like 6 months of not posting here, someone apparently mentioned my name in this subreddit, and I was banned because I was just too difficult for the evolutionists to try and disprove. Honestly all I ever got was insults and hate because thats all evolutionists can do, come only online as in real life they are cowards and cant talk all bold as they do online, they group together, and think ""yes I can insult him and all my evolutionists small brained morons will also defend me, and then they will ban him on top of it for some flimsy reason even though we are the ones cursing him out""

&amp;#x200B;

So yea guys, dont miss my point please as you all tend to do. My point is, you can NEVER know or Observe directly what we are and why or how we got here, so just enjoy life and stop wasting your time and life on this ridiculous theory. Focus on real science like chemistry or physics. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, for all you know, the Universe is a computer simulation and it could have been made 20,000 years ago and how would you know. Matter of fact, the universe IS a simulation. We have particles and randomness. Our universe just tends more towards randomness which is why we are the way we are and have some sort of free will, whereas computers dont as they are only able to process information directly with no randomness. Even when a computer does generate random numbers it does it via a direct algorithm, and theres nothing random about it. Somoene will maybe say im wrong here i dont know how computers work but watch as someone says I am wrong about how computers do RNG therefore everything else is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Gene Creation!  Increasing complexity and trait creation is assumed and believed, with no evidence that this can, or did, happen.
3. A Creator is religion! Atheism is science!  This propaganda meme is repeated constantly to give the illusion that only atheistic naturalism is capable of examination of data that suggests possible origins.
4. Abiogenesis. Life began, billions of years ago,  then evolved to what we see today.  But just as there is no evidence for spontaneous generation of life, so there is no evidence of universal common ancestry. Both are religious opinions. 
5. Mutation!  This is the Great White Hope, that the theory of common ancestry rides on.  Random mutations have produced all the variety and complexity we see today, beginning with a single cell.

What does man's best friend have to say about universal common descent?

I read the following study several years ago, and found a wealth of information about canidae.. many old beliefs or assumptions have been corrected by hard genetic evidence. It has interesting facts about dogs, &amp; their genetic base.

http://genome.cshlp.org/content/16/8/990.full

This is a study by evolutionists, with the assumptions of evolution dispersed throughout. They even quote Darwin. Here is a summary of some of the points, with quotes from the study :

1. The ancestor of wolves, coyotes, dogs, and other canidae is unknown, appears suddenly, and contained all the genetic information for each haplotype. ""the origin of the huge morphological diversity that led Darwin to his speculation remains largely unknown""
2. All of the current variety of dogs are recent developments, less than 200 yrs old. ""Recent studies show that the origin of most dog breeds may derive from very recent selective breeding practices and are probably &lt;200 yr old""
3. Selection acts on EXISTING variability. It is not created on the fly, &amp; is assumed to take thousands or millions of years to come about. ""selection acts upon existing variability""
4. ALL of this variability EXISTED in the ancestral wolf/parent, according to the time frame in the CA (common  ancestry) model. ""It is remarkable that the potential for such large diversification existed in the ancestral wolf population""
5. The recent time for the variety of dog breeds is incongruent with the assumption of 'millions' or even thousands of years of evolution, to generate such variety. ""Furthermore, the time since domestication seems insufficient to generate substantial additional genetic diversity.""

The child branches within canidae show REDUCING variability, as the diverse genetic information became localized in the various clades/haplogroups.

The mtDNA provides clear evidence of the descendancy within canidae, but the time frame is incompatible with the CA model.


From the link:
""Phylogenetic tree of wolf (W), dog (D), and coyote (C) mtDNA sequences. The tree was constructed using a Bayesian approach. The same topology was obtained with a neighbor-joining approach. Support is indicated at the nodes as percent bootstrap support for 1000 neighbor-joining replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Four clades of dog sequences (I to IV) are indicated as in Vilà et al. (1997). Internal dog branches are marked in orange, and internal wolf branches are marked in light blue. The branch leading to wolf haplotype W1 was basal to the rest of the tree and it was also considered internal. Internal branches that could not be conclusively associated to dogs or to wolves are indicated in discontinuous green.""

As you can see, the mtDNA shows the ancestry line. The canid ancestor preceded the wolf, the dog, &amp; the coyote, as well as other canidae not listed. I have seen them in other genetic studies. But all this does is PROVE descendancy, and shows the variability to be INHERENT in the genes. It was not created on the fly, or mutated over millions of years.

Canidae shows diversity and adaptability. There is no evidence they shared ancestry with felids, equids, or any other haplotype. We can follow the MICRO variations within canidae, but there is NOTHING to suggest they were once of a different genetic structure. Canids have always been canids, and always produce canids, though with reduced variability, as we reach the ends of the branches in their haplotree.

I welcome any rebuttal, alternate conclusions, or additions to this study on canidae.",69,1575471728,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e60gmq/common_ancestry_canidae/

DebateEvolution,e5hkxc,azusfan,,t2_541cninl,self.DebateEvolution,,Problems with Common Ancestry: MRCA,"
I propose an examination of the evidence, (and the problems), for the theory of universal common ancestry, aka, macro evolution. 

This thread is about mitochondrial DNA, and the discovery some years back, of a 'marker', that was passed down to daughters, tracing actual descent. It leads to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA), in genetic lines, and provides hard science for timelines, descent, and relationships.

From wiki:
In human genetics, the Mitochondrial Eve (also mt-Eve, mt-MRCA) is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans, i.e., the most recent woman from whom all living humans descend in an unbroken line purely through their mothers, and through the mothers of those mothers, back until all lines converge on one woman.

It is a problem for the theory of common descent, as it clearly shows the lines of descent in a particular genetic haplogroup.

For example, we can trace the descendancy in canids.. dogs, wolves, coyotes.. even though they are different morphologically, they show evidence of descent, and share a common mother.. the Most Recent Common Ancestor that they ALL descended from.

This marker does not cross over to other speculated ancestors. Humans, for example, share a common MRCA, which shows we all descended from the same mother, and did not evolve seperately, in different geological regions, as was once proposed. Neanderthals were human. Pygmies, Mongols, Eskimos, Europeans, Africans.. every race, region and body type of human beings all share the MRCA.. a marker showing descendancy and relationship with all other humans. Chimps, monkeys, apes, or any other speculated 'cousins', do not have this MRCA marker, but their own, showing THEIR  line of descent.

So, while the dingo, dog, wolf and coyote can be traced to a MRCA, humans, apes, and monkeys cannot. Each has its own MRCA, and they do not intersect or overlap. There is no evidence of descent.

From wiki:
""Mitochondrial DNA is the small circular chromosome found inside mitochondria. These organelles found in cells have often been called the powerhouse of the cell. The mitochondria, and thus mitochondrial DNA, are passed almost exclusively from mother to offspring through the egg cell.
...
Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by electron microscopy as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria, and by Ellen Haslbrunner, Hans Tuppy and Gottfried Schatz by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.""


TMRCA:

Time to most recent common ancestor, aka 'mitochondrial clock'.

Source:
News this Week | Science

""Regardless of the cause, evolutionists are most concerned about the effect of a faster mutation rate.
For example, researchers have calculated that ""mitochondrial Eve""--the woman whose mtDNA was ancestral to that in all living people--lived 100,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa. Using the new
clock, she would be a mere 6000 years old.
...
The most widely used mutation rate for noncoding human mtDNA relies on estimates of the date when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor, taken to be 5 million years ago. That date is based on counting the mtDNA and protein differences between all the great apes and timing their divergence using dates from fossils of one great ape's ancestor. In humans, this yields a rate of about one mutation every 300 to 600 generations, or one every 6000 to 12,000 years..""

..aka, circular reasoning.. you presume the descendancy of apes and humans, THEN calculate a 'rate!'. It is convenient if the data fits within (and is based upon) the preconceived assumptions.

""The researchers sequenced 610 base pairs of the mtDNA control region in 357 individuals from 134 different families, representing 327 generational events, or times that mothers passed on mtDNA to their offspring. Evolutionary studies led them to expect about one mutation in 600 generations (one every 12,000 years). So they were “stunned” to find 10 base-pair changes, which gave them a rate of one mutation every 40 generations, or one every 800 years. The data were published last year in Nature Genetics, and the rate has held up as the number of families has doubled..""

So the ACTUAL, MEASURED rates, from real life data and evidence, is suspected, while the ASSUMPTIONS are clung to with dogmatic certainty. The measured, scientifically based rate is dismissed, in favor of the assumed and believed rate that fits the belief.",249,1575382017,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e5hkxc/problems_with_common_ancestry_mrca/
DebateEvolution,e57ran,Rayalot72,Philosophy Nerd,t2_ofntq,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Philosophical Problems With Intelligent Design Arguments,"I wanted to take a moment to argue against Meyer's intelligent design arguments.  I see these everywhere in creationist circles, and think they receive too much credit.  While I think the objections by the more scientifically minded are good, those tend to be more technical, involving problems with the numbers and equations.  As a result, they're much less accessible, and are often ignored and not shared around.  My hope is to provide a more direct critique of what the argument is trying to do, which should be much more marketable and difficult for creationists to avoid.  The numbers can be granted, and the argument would still fail.  I also believe this can be done while granting most of Meyer's ideas.  

These objections should work for both the evolutionary intelligent design argument and the abiogenesis intelligent design argument, but I will focus on the abiogenesis version since it's more compelling as an argument for design, and more commonly used by creationists.  I will focus on two subjects, and have multiple sections for approaches to each.  I will also argue against a version with a very strong conclusion as the main objective of the post, and then relate those objections to weaker versions in a third section afterwards.  

#Designers:

Depending on the variation of the argument, the goal is to conclude that life is or is probably, at some stage, designed, and, therefore, there is a designer.  However, if we ask who or what the designer is, and how we know that, this conclusion turns out to be very hard to reach.  

Most important for this section is going to be cosmological principles.  Infinite regression creates a lot of philosophical problems when used as an ultimate explanation.  Some may not be possible, while others require explanations themselves.  For this reason, some final explanation must serve as the termination point (which I will refer to as ""ultimate explanation"").  This is used in the context of intelligent design to defend that design is the superior explanation, as it can act as the start of the chain, while naturalistic explanations themselves need to be explained.  This sort of designer is unlike any other designer we see day to day, and very similar to God.  A pretty strong conclusion.  Obviously, I will defend that this doesn't work out.  

**We Ought to Kick the can:**

So, let's consider what we can know about the designer.  We observe design regularly, and this is what Meyer uses to establish that design is able to explain abiogenesis.  The two designers we observe are biological, such as humans and other primates, and designed, such as computers and machines that can assemble other things.  

This creates an inductive problem for this strong notion of intelligent design.  All designed designers can be traced back to us, and we are biological entities.  This means all designers we observe are these natural beings, so we can know inductively that all designers probably have explanations.  This prevents designers from being valid termination points, as we are justified in believing they will all either be designed or themselves or biological in nature.  Design is just as good of an explanation as any other naturalistic explanation because we'll need to go one step further either way.  Even worse, we have reason to think there were no biological designers early in the universe, so we *must* have an explanation for at least some biological designers that does not involve design, and this explanation will likely apply to us as well.  

What if we already know God exists?  This would provide an interesting defense of intelligent design for *Christians and other theists*, since they can avoid the induction, but this will not matter for anyone starting from other positions.  I will also give reasons for why God is still not a better explanation in the next section.  

**Misuse of Cosmological Termination:**

What is the explanation for the movement of planets in our solar system?  Well, this is explained by the bending of space-time, the mass of the planets and the sun, their velocities, etc., and there are explanations as to how the masses and velocities got to be as they are, etc., until we eventually arrive at some ultimate explanation that is either necessary or brute.  

In the above example, we can see that our explanations interact with one another in a chain to get to a termination point, making any explanation along this chain a good explanation.  The cosmological principle described at the start of this subject is quite strange, then, as it aims to differentiate between designers and most naturalistic explanations in terms of their relation to ultimate explanations.  Since any naturalistic explanation provided can be explained by very ordinary natural facts (chemicals, physics, thermodynamics, etc.) which we know have ultimate explanations down the line, they don't truly violate our cosmological principles, so we don't need any special entities, such as ultimate designers, to serve as corrections.  We need not kick the can after all.  

Theists cannot appeal to God as a best explanation in this case, since He is just as viable as an ultimate explanation as any other fact God explains, which includes natural facts.  Some further argument is required to differentiate those explanations such that God is better for other reasons, which will be dealt with in the second subject.  

#Irreducibility:

The second facet of intelligent design arguments is the notion that biological complexity is irreducible.  It could not reasonably be caused by undirected processes, and design is the only or best example of a directed process we have.  

Most numbers-related objections are directed at this component of the intelligent design argument.  As stated in the introduction, I will not talk about these, but I believe I can poke some interesting holes in it anyway.  

**More can Kicking:**

In requiring a ""directed process,"" this could really be any source of complexity, information, etc. that exists prior to life, whether it's a designer, life (panspermia), or something else.  This creates a new problem where all the sources of these phenomenon we observe are natural, and the inductive argument described for first subject can be repeated in these broader terms to conclude natural complexity, information, etc.  

**The Epistemic Problem of Irreducibility:**

How can you know that something is irreducible?  Well, a few arguments for irreducibility exist in other areas, and they are fairly successful.  I will cover three different approaches, the third of which is most applicable to how intelligent design arguments are presented, but the other two are good analogies for similar arguments in creationist circles.  

The open question argument/naturalistic fallacy defends that moral properties can't be reducible to any other properties, like natural properties, since they'd be analytically equivalent, yet we don't treat them as definitionally the same (this argument is quite widely rejected, but for reasons unrelated to irreducibility).  So, we may be able to deduce irreducibility, but no facts in science seem to entail that complexity, information, etc., could not arise by undirected processes.  It can only be argued to be improbable, or not known to occur, so irreducibility is not guarenteed.  Some intelligent design arguments of this sort do exist, the argument that biology violates the second law of thermodynamics is a good example, but these are unsound, to put it lightly (they grossly misunderstand physics and other disciplines).  

The triviality objection is a similar argument which defends that, if moral properties are reducible to other properties, such as natural properties, then it would be trivial to show that they are the same.  This is a different approach that appeals to a straightforward reducibility that we ought to be able to do, but can't.  In this case, the nature of science makes this sort of objection inapplicable to abiogenesis.  Many scientific discoveries are quite non-trivial, and take time to find.  If abiogenesis occurred by natural processes, we couldn't expect to know how it happened regardless of how long research has been ongoing.  The claims that abiogenesis research has taken too long or that we have no naturalistic explanation right now, when used to defend creationism, are examples of arguments from triviality, and fail due to vague or indefensible assertions about what state abiogenesis research ought to be in.  

Arguments for dualism and against physicalism in the philosophy of mind are the closest to Meyer's original intelligent design arguments.  In the former case, the irreducibility of the mind is presented as the best account of mental phenomenon, evading the problems physicalism has with emergentism, qualia, and the difficulty of complete reduction.  For the latter, the improbability of the complexity, information, etc. is used to defend its probable irreducibility to undirected mechanisms as the best explanation of that phenomenon.  This makes many of the same mistakes as the triviality approach to the irreducibility of life.  Just because those numbers that result in such bad odds are accurate now (again, his numbers are quite questionable, I'm merely granting them for sake of argument) doesn't mean they will not change once research has progressed.  We me also discover alternative processes and structures which gave rise to life which require completely different calculations.  The true conclusion is that life is not reducible *to the structures we know of as we know them now*.  We also have very little information on abiogenesis, as we weren't there, have little to no fossils from that time, and only have the earth as an example of a life-bearing planet.  This provides very good reason to think we wouldn't be able to figure out how abiogenesis occured if it did.  

For the abduction to irreducibility, I should also point out that all of the objections raised for the first subject are damning to it.  Its dependence on probability means that a designer that can explain it mustn't be improbable, but those counter-arguments demonstrate just that.  A weaker objection that accomplishes the same goal would be referencing to the rarity of design in nature to suggest it's not actually a very good explanation, and, thus, harder to abduct to.  This may require first establishing that evolution is free of design, so that there is a good set of examples natural and undirected complexity, information, etc.

**Disparity in Progress:**

Over time, we've come up with more detailed accounts of how life may have started with abiogenesis.  We seem to be moving, for the time being, towards undirected natural processes.  Design, on the other hand, isn't something we've found much evidence for, and we may not even be able to find evidence of it if it did occur.  

While unverifiable and unfalsifiable explanations have become more acceptable in science, they are still very hard to defend as the best explanations of phenomenon.  Much more is needed than we have now to defend that inference, which puts irreducibility at a significant disadvantage to begin with.  

#Weaker Intelligent Design Arguments:

A lot of variations of Meyer's argument are much less useful to creationists but definitely easier to defend.  While I'm much less bothered by these, I also don't think they truly avoid the problems I describe for the first two subjects.  

**Abduction to Inclusive Intelligent Design:**

As pointed out for the first subject, natural designers would be the most likely designers, and would still terminate at some other explanation.  They cannot be much better explanations than just abiogenesis.  

Other sources of complexity, information, etc. are just as viable explanations as, if not better than, designers.  Panspermia in particular is a very good alternative candidate, since it fulfills all of the same purposes.  

Design may not actually be very probable for the reasons provided for the second subject.  If they were natural designers, we should have an even greater expectation of evidence that they exist, which, despite what UFO enthusiasts might say, we don't have.  Ayys are probably not responsible.  

**Intelligent Design as a Scientific Postulate:**

This is an argument I'm willing to concede, with caveats.  

For the reasons provided in the first subject, only natural designers are likely, so the notion that life was seeded by extratarrestrials is the only design postulate that works.  

This could be different if starting from theism, but science operates as if there are no non-natural facts (or at least, it won't draw conclusions about them), so God or designers as ultimate explanations are excluded.  

This conclusion is quite trivial, I seriously doubt much of anyone leaning on the side of abiogenesis entirely excluded this as a possibility.  It's definitely not what creationists are looking for, and it doesn't seem as if Meyer is aiming for *merely* this conclusion either.",15,1575329917,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/e57ran/philosophical_problems_with_intelligent_design/

&gt;In the world of myth, miracles are commonplace and occur regularly. Much the same could be said of evolutionary myths of origins. Just like in the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories and the Wolverine stories from the First Nations of North America, in the evolutionary origins myth one regularly encounters phenomena that are contrary to natural law and which have never been observed by any human. And the first of these miracles is abiogenesis, the transition from inert matter to living organisms, capable of reproducing themselves. But that is just the beginning. From there we go on to the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, then there’s the transition from marine organisms, such as fish, to terrestrial organisms, the transition from reptiles to mammals, the transition from land mammals to marine mammals and then the transition from crawling reptiles to flying birds. But the greatest miracle of all? This is undoubtedly the appearance of functional genetic code and its chemical basis, DNA, and all this without the intervention of a Programmer. It is clear that miracles abound in the evolutionary origins myth. The faith of evolutionary believers is great, but for my part I have to admit lacking enough faith to believe in such miracles

https://thenaturalhistorian.com/2019/11/11/the-lake-malawi-sediment-chronometer-and-thetoba-super-eruption/

Using C14 dating on the sediment below the lake floor, scientists were able to work out a deposition rate of 0.03 - 0.04cm per year for much of the lake's history.

The Toba Supereruption dating estimate was about 75000 years ago based on 40Ar/39Ar, 230Th/234U, ice core and spaleotherm dating methods

https://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/E3047


Now, C14 dating is only accurate to 50 000 years, so thr sedimentation rate was used to estimate the depth at which the Toba Supereruption should be - 75 000years * 0.03-0.04cm/year =&gt; that is, 24-30m down. 

And indeed, the Toba ash layer was found as predicted 28m down.

DebateEvolution,dwne76,witchdoc86,Professional Vampire,t2_ccp95,self.DebateEvolution,,SN1987A and the Age of the Universe,"There is one supernova in history that has allowed us to calculate its distance from us - INDEPENDENT of the speed of light in terms of light years, using simple trigonometry. It is SN1987A. 

&gt; After the progenitor star Sk-69 202 exploded, astronomers measured the time it took for the energy to travel from the star to the primary ring that is around the star. From this, we can determined the actual radius of the ring from the star. Second, we already knew the angular size of the ring against the sky (as measured through telescopes, and measured most precisely with the Hubble Space Telescope).

&gt; So to carry out the calculation think of a right triangle as indicated in the diagram below.

&gt; The line from SN1987A to earth (distance) is the base.
A line from SN1987A to the ring (the radius of the ring) is the height.
The line from the ring to earth is the hypotenuse.
The angle between the base and the hypotenuse is half the angular size of the ring
trig formula: base = radius ÷ tan(angle)


&gt; Substituting:

&gt; radius = 6.23 x 1012 km (see note 1 below) = 0.658 light-years
angle = 0.808 arcseconds (see note 1 below) = 0.000224 degrees
distance = 0.658 ly ÷ tan(0.000224)
distance = 0.658 ly ÷ 0.00000392
distance = 168,000 light-years
Note that taking the measurement error limits into account makes this value 168,000 light-years ± 3.5%.

&gt; For reference:
    c (lightspeed) = 299,792.5 kilometers per second
    1 arcsecond = 1/3600°
    1 parsec = 3.26 light-years
    1 light-year ~ 9.46 x 1012 km
    1 light-year ~ 5.88 x 10^12 miles

&gt;""What a curious argument Dawkins gives regarding the ""poor design"" of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Is he not aware that the nerve does more than innervate the larynx? It gives branches to the cardiac plexus, esophagus and trachea in addition to the muscles of the larynx. Hence its circuitous route is necessary and not inefficient. I do thyroidectomies all the time and have to be careful not to injure any part of the nerve during the dissection, not just the branches that serve the larynx. Also, the superior laryngeal nerve does give a direct connection to the larynx, and complements the recurrent laryngeal nerve and provides redundancy in function, so a more direct pathway already exists.""

Oh goodie you can read wikipedia

If anything it misunderstands the purpose of design, efficiency.

&gt;There are unusual conditions in which either the right or left recurrent laryngeal nerves do not loop around in the chest but rather directly innervate the larynx. In such individuals, there is the potential for significant problems in swallowing and breathing. Ironically, if you subscribe to the evolutionary paradigm, such conditions may represent example of mutations that regularly occur but yet evolution ""chooses"" not to select out for the more direct route!

Interesting...so they admit it is bad design but say ask ""well why doesn't evolution select for the better design huh?""
The answer being while evolution is powerful...it goes for the ""quickest"" solution, not the most ""efficient"" 9ne. If the design hypothesis was true, we would see that instead of what we have

Oi. Mate. There is NO hardware in organisms. What, you think that organisms have transistor counts? Tflops? Shader cores? This is the height of incompetence. No, creationist is not saying that ""software"" in organisms is an analogy (though I'd still take a problem with it being used an analogy). Said creationist actually thinks organisms has actual, literal software and that organs and other stuff are ""hardware."" It is beyond a joke. If you cannot show actual evidence of said software, please, for my sanity, just don't even approach this subject. You will save me a pounding headache at least.

It is beyond infuriating to see those of you try and screw up my passion for computers and use ""tech"" terms in a conversation where it most certainly does not belong. Not only do I have to sit and watch screw up my area of passion, I also have to watch back in exasperation as you try and bamboozle people with ""tech"" words which you use out of place - in other words, said creationists use these ""tech"" terms in an area where they have no applicability.

The wide variety of shapes of birth canals around the world is evidence for neutral mutations from genetic drift, as well as evidence against a recent bottleneck, and also against a strict dualistic antagonism of evolutionary forces of a widely held theory of the ""obstetric dilemma"" - 

&gt;  ‘obstetrical dilemma’ - whereby locomotory efficiency poses a limit to the size of the birth canal in our species, sometimes leading to childbirth complications due to cephalo-pelvic disproportion (a mismatch between the size of the fetus' skull and the mother's birth canal).

This theorised obstetric dilemma was thought to

&gt; The shape of a mother’s birth canal is a tug-of-war between two opposing evolutionary forces: It needs to be wide enough to allow our big-brained babies to pass through, yet narrow enough to allow women to walk efficiently.

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1807

That being said, there has been evidence 

&gt; Despite this seeming lack of change in average pelvic morphology, we show that humans have evolved a complex link between pelvis shape, stature, and head circumference that was not recognized before. The identified covariance patterns contribute to ameliorate the “obstetric dilemma.” Females with a large head, who are likely to give birth to neonates with a large head, possess birth canals that are shaped to better accommodate large-headed neonates. Short females with an increased risk of cephalopelvic mismatch possess a rounder inlet, which is beneficial for obstetrics. We suggest that these covariances have evolved by the strong correlational selection resulting from childbirth. 

https://www.pnas.org/content/112/18/5655.short

tl;dr

Birth canals are evidence that humans undergo neutral mutations and genetic drift. 
Birth canals are evidence against a recent Adam and Eve / Noah's Flood genetic bottleneck a few thousand years ago.

Here are a few of his basic misunderstandings:

&gt;One form of radiometric dating is often used to compare with another, and this case should be no different.

Except the half life of different isotopes are well known. There is zero point in comparing C14 dating to K-Ar, U-Pb etc. I don’t use a thermometer for snow temperature to check my BBQ when I’m searing steaks at 700F. It would be useless. 

&gt;particularly when the science of biochemistry justifies believing that this material could be within the range of C14 testing.

Why should we accept that these may fossils of magnitude younger than many other dating methods suggest when you’ve yet to demonstrate that the methods of burial / preservation precludes what Schweitzer found. 

&gt;How do you know [the fossils] are too old [for carbon dating]?

DebateEvolution,dfry62,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,"Stratigraphy, a very brief introduction.","Every time anything related to dating rocks comes up, there seems to be an huge lack of knowledge. Here is a simple primer on the subject. We will (and again, I want to stress briefly) look at lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronostratigraphy.  Hopefully this sparks some discussion, and gives people a starting off place for some more reading. 

Nicholas Steno, a Catholic Priest posited the first laws of stratigraphy: The law of superposition, the principle of horizontality, the principle of lateral continuity, and the principle of cross cutting relationships. These basic ideas are not new, steno published them in his Dissertationis prodromus in 1669. 

The law of superposition states that the older layers are deeper than younger layers. For example, if you dig down in your yard, each soil horizon you encounter is older than the one above it.

The principle of horizontality states that rocks are largely deposited horizontally. For the purposes of this discussion we can assume horizontal deposition. 

The principle of lateral continuity states that the deposition will extend on a horizontal plane, in theory for ever. Like the principle of horizontality, this is not strictly true, but it is sufficient for this example. An example of when this principle is used is in a canyon, it can be assumed that similar rocks on either side of the canyon were deposited at the together.

Finally the principle of cross cutting relationships states that if a layer is cut by another rock, the rock that cut the layer must be younger. 

There is one more important bit think to know before we are ready to look at some examples, unconformities. An unconformity occurs when there is a hiatus from deposition. There are four types of unconformities. Angular, disconformity, paraconformity, and non-conformity.  However for the purposes of this post, we will not get into the specifics of each. 

Now we can examine the simple diagram [here](https://imgur.com/a/UU2eaAD). I put the M in myself, as it appears the creator of this exercise forgot to label the layer, or I need to visit my optometrist. 

I pulled the image from [this site](http://tsime.uz.ac.zw/claroline/backends/download.php?url=L0hHTF8xMDVfQVBQTElFRF9HRU9MT0dZX0lfUkVMQVRJVkVfREFUSU5HX0VYRVJDSVNFUy5wZGY%3D&amp;cidReset=true&amp;cidReq=HGL105).
 

Starting from youngest to oldest.

A, followed by B due to cross cutting. Then there is an unconformity, followed by the deposition of M, D, E, F, G, and H. The rocks then underwent tilting, then there was another hiatus. Following the second unconformity I, J, K, and L were deposited, before Dike C penetrated all of the layers. I should note, that even if the creator of the exercise wasn’t so kinds as to label the unconformities, they are easy to spot by the erosional surfaces (wavy lines).

So far we have assigned relatives ages to the rocks, using techniques that are over 300 years old.

Next we can look at fossils, as this example doesn’t include biostratigraphy, we’ll just put some fossils in the layers. 

Rocks A (most likely some metamorphic basement rock, B, and C all do not have fossils as they are not sedimentary. 

Below we have the rocks in the upper case letters, and the fossil types in lower case letters. 

* L: a, b, c 
* K: a, c 
* J: a, c, d
* I: a, c, d
* H: a, e, f
* G: a, e, f, g
* F: a, e, f
* E: a, f, h
* D: f
* M: f, i 

So from this limited example, we see fossil a and f both covering wide ranges of time, making them usesless for dating rocks. Meanwhile fossils b, g, h, and i are present only in a single, layer. If these fossils cover a wide geographical area, they may be good index fossils. An index fossil is a short lived organism, that covered a very wide geographic area. This allows geologists to narrow down the age of the rocks containing an index fossil.

Geologists have been using both of these methods of dating for centuries. Recently, radiometric dating has made dating rocks much easier.  Using granite B and dike C we can use radiometric dating to get an absolute upper and lower bounds for this entire suit of rock, save rock A. 

By combing this information, along with the information with other study areas, we can continue to put stricter bounds on the age of the rocks.  For example if we find fossil g sandwiched between two igneous layers without the unconformities in this example, we can reduce the range of time that layer G was deposited in this example. 

Hopefully this sheds some light on why lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy,  and chronostratigraphy are not circular. This also shows why carbon dating fossils found within the upper and lower bounds of this example is a waste of resources. We know what the limits of the ages of the rocks.",37,1570676714,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/dfry62/stratigraphy_a_very_brief_introduction/

This is because evolution cannot produce indivisible entities; every product of evolution is a composite of smaller parts (organs, tissues, cells, organelles, etc.) that have come together to produce an entity that is indisputably divisible. So souls cannot have evolved. Nor, Harari says, does it make sense to think that souls just “appeared one day in the fullness of their glory. \[... B\]iology cannot explain the birth of a baby possessing an eternal soul from parents who did not have even a shred of a soul”. (This discussion goes on on pages 103-106.)

I had never encountered this argument before, and Harari doesn't cite anyone as offering this sort of view (either in favor of it or against it). Is this sort of idea widespread, or is Harari on his own in making this observation?

DebateEvolution,dcqm6i,PaulDouglasPrice,,t2_46k3iah9,self.DebateEvolution,,Question about something on Talk Origins,"As most of you here are aware, Talk Origins is often cited as the go-to source on the web for refuting creationist arguments. Well I've been examining one of the articles there about polystrate fossil trees, and there's something I'm needing help understanding on this page:  


 [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

In it, we see the following statement:  


&gt; As for Malone's ""problem"" with the ""thousands of years"" for the tree to remain upright for ""slow accumulation"" to occur, it is a non-problem - he is simply interpolating the average depositional rates for an entire formation down to the scale of metres. This is *not* the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur. In short, he is assuming conventional geologists would interpret the occurrence the simple way he has interpolated - they do not. 

  
So if I understand him right here, he's saying that the tree log is buried by successive waves of rapid local floods, with many thousands or millions of years sandwiched in between the layers? I don't understand how that solves the fundamental problem that the tree would not just sit there without rotting away while waiting to be fossilized.

DebateEvolution,d4ktwu,RCero,,t2_liv2e,self.DebateEvolution,,AiG's claim of an Ark filled with animal families (kinds) instead of species is incompatible with Irreducible Complexity and more,"Recently I watched the Nye vs Ham debate (it was ok, but Bill Nye could have done it much better).

From all Ham's points, one attracted my attention: That only a pair of  each family (or genus, instead of species, was aboard the ark and afterwards (micro)evolved into all the current species. Ingenious, but extremely flawed idea. There are many ways to reject Ham's hypothesis, for example today's observed mutation and speciation rate can't create so many species...also, if in the ""a pair of each species"" model it seemed impossible for the low reproduction-rate animal pairs to spread and proliferate up to today's big numbers in so little time, a ""a pair of each family"" ark exacerbates the problem, as part of their descendants has to be turned into other species by Ham magic super-microevolution.

But that's not what I want to talk about.

It's about a common counter-argument against evolution: the Irreducible complexity of characteristics that supposedly can't be break down to smaller changes. Creationism/ID are categorical about micro-evolution can't create new characteristics beyond ""size"", ""color"" or disabling/enabling a gene that was already there.

**BUT**, if all current species were generated from a pair of a species, **if we find in characteristics in species that fit in the Irreducible complexity** definition which **aren't shared with the other members of the same family**, that would mean **(micro?)evolution can generate the so-called Irreducible complexity**, IC can't exist and **there's nothing stopping micro-evolution from turning into MACROevolution.**

Thanks, Ken Ham, for supporting evolution with AiG's YEC theories.

PS: Isn't it funny that Ham's theory is backed up with the fossil record? Creationists are always repeating the ""gaps"" in the fossil record discredit Darwinism, but they have no problem in using it in their post-ark super-micro-evolution, despite the alleged lack of transitional forms.",23,1568556201,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/d4ktwu/aigs_claim_of_an_ark_filled_with_animal_families/

I haven't read the paper that this article is based on, but there are a few simple take aways from the AP article.

Jee used two instances of gravitational lenses to come up with a new Hubble Constant, resulting in a margin of error that includes 13.7 billion years in her work.  

And as per the article:

&gt;Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who wasn't part of the study, said it is an interesting and unique way to calculate the universe's expansion rate, but the large error margin limits its effectiveness until more information can be gathered.
""It is difficult to be certain of your conclusions if you use a ruler that you don't fully understand,"" Loeb said in an email.

I don't have know enough about cosmology to know if this is relevant criticism, or just a failing of media reporting on science.

Finally I'm very confused as to why the YECers are excited about this new finding.

&gt;I have been scanning around at several of the other subreddits devoted to Christianity, even the supposedly conservative-leaning ones, and I have started to notice an almost complete absence of representation for what I believe is the true Biblical view of origins: so-called ""young-earth"" creationism.

&gt;I hope I'm wrong about this, but that's the impression I am getting. If so, it's a sad indicator of things to come, as I think the general trend is that Reddit is somewhat representative of the attitudes of younger generations as a whole. Just a conversation-starter. Obviously this subreddit is a very small enclave, and even here there is no obvious consensus supporting young earth creation, or at least it is not unanimous.

DebateEvolution,czecid,SpecialistRaisin,,t2_3ghp3u3o,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Are the problems raised against Mendel's Accountant really that damning?,"Recently I came across an old argument about the degree to which Mendel's Accountant, a population genetics simulator, could be said to have accurately demonstrated that a genome would deteriorate over time under natural selection. The argument eventually reached a point where a contributor raised four points that seemed to have been directly drawn from this forum post ([http://www.rationalskepticism.org/creationism/mendel-s-accountant-t2991.html](http://www.rationalskepticism.org/creationism/mendel-s-accountant-t2991.html)), to which the other poster responded with various rebuttals that went unanswered.

\&gt; 1. ""in Mendel's Account, the total ratio of non-functional human DNA is equal to zero."" -&gt; This person has no idea what they're talking about. The default is 10 function altering mutations per generation with 0.001% of those beneficial with the rest deleterious. With \~100 mutations per generation these parameters assume \~90% of mutations are neutral, which are not tracked.

\&gt; 2.""no such thing as gene linkage has been included in the model"" -&gt; Wrong again. The [Mendel manual](http://mendelsaccount.sourceforge.net/userman.pdf) goes through all the parameters for linkage blocks. You say that not simulating linkage ""favour\[2\] accumulation of non-harmful mutations"" but the opposite is true. Linkage causes hitchhiking of deleterious mutations with beneficial mutations

\&gt; 3. ""the program does not simulate sexual selection at all"" -&gt; Correct. But sexual selection favors the pretty over the functional--they are not always the same. Simulating sexual selection increases the rate at which deleterious mutations accumulate.

\&gt; 4. ""the program does not allow for gene duplication events."" -&gt; Correct. But Mendel's model is more generous to evolution than if gene duplication were simulated.

Firstly, my apologies for posting it hard on the heels of another person's post asking for similar assistance. I too have a creationist trying to demonstrate why evolution cannot be trusted and the bible holds all the answers, etc. I'm not a scientist, much less a geneticist, and much of this article is beyond me (and beyond her too but that's beside the point). 

I've responded that if the arguments made in the article had any merit, they'd have been posted in a mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journal, not at creation.com, but that's all I've got - and it's quite possible that unbeknowns to me the arguments may well have been presented somewhere else. 

What I'd like to know, if there are people here knowledgeable enough to understand the article and respond to it, is whether the commonly-heard assertion that humans &amp; chimps are 95-98% alike in terms of their DNA is actually correct, or if it involves flawed if not outright biased assumptions as this article alleges &amp; the true figure is a lot lower?

DebateEvolution,csf7jp,ammuseskepsci19,,t2_4e8ny8m6,self.DebateEvolution,,Dismantling Creationist Counter Responses to Genetic Evidence,"Hi guys,

Often in arguments with creationists, they completely dismiss the genetic evidence by saying that if the genetic sequence/DNA is similar between different species, etc. then this is proof of a common designer who used the “same code” (like the author of a book who uses the letters of the alphabet) instead of common ancestry. This is such an absurd claim and it demonstrates that they have no idea what they’re talking about. Therefore, I’m going to completely dismantle their entire argument using evidence from the monoclonality of tumours in cancer.

Cancer is considered to be a genetic and cell-signalling disease and one consequence of cancer is the development of tumours (neoplasms) – an abnormal mass of immortalised cells.

One way in which cancers develop is when particular mutations arise in cells. Once a mutation appears in a cell, it is transferred to all the descendants of that cell. Therefore, when one examines two or more cancer cells in a tumour and identifies the same complex mutation in their DNA, it establishes that those cells are related. The singular mutation was transmitted from that ancestral cell to all its descendants. A cell population descended from a single progenitor is called a clone. In 1976, PC Nowell proposed this idea of clonal succession – where tumours develop by sequential replacement of increasingly more malignant clones. Therefore, most tumours are monoclonal, meaning that they arise from onealtered cell. The monoclonality of tumours is supported by multiple lines of evidence:

·  **X chromosome inactivation**: Early in the development of a female, there is random silencing of one X-chromosome in each cell. In normal tissues, maternal and paternal alleles of the X-linked gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) are each expressed in 50% of the cells. However, in tumours, the same allele is expressed in all cells – indicating they are all descended from the one cell expressing that allele. 

·  **In B and T lymphocytes**, when one of several V, D, and J segments assemble, antigen receptor genes (such as IGH,TCR) ensue. V-D and D-J coding joints are formed randomly and have a high degree of variability. In normal populations of lymphocytes, a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) across these junctions generates multiple products. In lymphomas (blood cancers) however, only oneproduct is generated via PCR – indicating that every cell is descended from the one cell in which that distinctive IGH or TCR rearrangement arose.

·  **Tumours arising from oncogenic viruses**: DNA from the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) (which cause liver and cervical cancer, respectively) is inserted into the genome of cells at randomly chosen sites. Every individual tumour has a different viral DNA insertion site and every cell in any particular tumour has the same insertion site – because every cell is descended from the one cell in which that unique insertion event occurred.

·  **Mutations in ‘cancer genes’**: A unique DNA insertion, deletion, duplication or rearrangement/gene fusion may distinguish every cell in a tumour. For example, leukaemia’s may develop in identical monochorionic twins at 4-6 years of age with the same mutation. This arose from a mutant clone distributed throughout a shared placenta, *in utero*. 

·  **Mutations of the mitochondrial genome**: A mutation in a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule may replace all the wild-type mtDNA molecules within that mitochondrion. After that, all the normal mitochondria in a cell are replaced with the mutant mitochondrion; and then all the normal cells in a tissue are replaced with the mutant cell – common in cancer. Every cell with the mtDNA mutation is descended from the onecell in which the mutation arose.

Therefore, clones and lineages of cells are identified by shared mutations. 

What’s great about this is that it also applies to evolution via the same logic. The monoclonal nature of oncogenesis (cancer development) is established by the genetic evidence in the same way that phylogenesis (species development) is supported.

When multiple individuals share singular complex mutations, then all those individuals are descended from the one reproductive cell of the single individual in whom that mutation occurred. Therefore, if multiple species share singular mutations at the same location in their DNA, then all those species are derived from the one species (the single reproductive cell) in which each of those mutations occurred. **Therefore, the monoclonality of tumours (which are evolving populations of cancer cells) perfectly corresponds with the law of monophyly in species (populations capable of producing fertile offspring) development.**

In cancer, if all the cells in a tumour share a particular mutation (clonal), this is known as a founder mutation. Within this, you may have different populations of cells that have their own unique mutations (in addition to the founder mutation). These unique mutations that belong to distinct cell populations within the tumour are called passenger mutations and these populations are known as subclones. Therefore, you have subclones within clones. Likewise, for evolution, you have clades within clades – where a particular mutation, endogenous retrovirus (ERV) insert, transposable element (jumping gene), or pseudogene may be found within every member of that clade (and therefore arose within the single reproductive cell of a common ancestor); and within this clade you can have new clades arising with their own unique mutations (while still belonging to their parent clade). This is clearly evidence of common ancestry. When you consider cancer cells, these are obviously naturally occurring and therefore not “designed by an intelligence,” and since they all share the same mutation – they arose from the same common ancestor. Likewise, the similarity in DNA sequences between different species and the same location of mutations is evidence of common ancestry.

DebateEvolution,csdwfl,LordBeerus209,,t2_w36msc2,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"Dawkins, the hero of evolutionismists, defends pedophilia (correction he claims it’s “mild pedophilia”). Why do you people even defend him at all after what he said? If a creationists said half the insanity he spoke he'd instantly be petitioned to be hit with charges.","This is the person all of you look up to.

While he will claim he doesn't defend it after the fact and only says that ""it was a different Era bla bla"", basic human psychology tells us he's using this argument to get the entire argument as a whole of him thinking having sex with minor is totally and evolutionarily ok.

Technically for a species to evolve. The healthiest mates and the highest chance of producing the most offspring and as early as possible is when a human is 13-14. 

Because many males aren't attractive or desirable to women anyway especially evolutinists, in an ideal world where the survival of the fittest is in full swing, a man who just wants to do what his body demands of him which is to have sex and produce offspring, would simply fight off and take a young 14 year old, threaten her that he has the power and can harm her but if she obeys everything will be OK. He will then abuse her and bare children and his stupid genes will pass on and he won the ""game of passing on his genes"" which is the staple of evolution and the staple of ""evolving"".

Dawkins in an ideal world not populated by majority who believe in a God, would not hesitate to make arguments passing laws to allow legal sex as young as 13, after all, they first imagine their theory, and then go to the lab to find evidence to prove it. Whatever they find as ""evidence"" is instantly in support of their theory and never against it. Which is how all ""evidence of evolution is"". You find similar structures and find the same multi cellular organisms and the same DNA sequencing and molecules forming it, but yet take that evidence as ""support for evolution"". Any open minded could easily debunk that and say finding similarities doesn't mean it's common ancestry. Maybe the common ancestry is from a common creator who obviously used the same programming in the form of DNA and multi cellular organism to create the life.

You guys think had it been a real creator he'd have made some have DNA, and the others be made of gas or something with silicon replacing carbon, and the amino acids and the DNA made entirely of different molecules?

That would also be just plain dumb to assume that. A common creator is just as much a possibility when looking at the same evidence as ancestry.

But anyway back to Dawkins. He's insane. Anyone who writes a book specifically having it all be about ad hominen attacks and straw man arguments and absolutely nothing about the actual science is insane. Doesn't Dawkins have anything better to do than try and claim anyone who simply chooses to believe in a creator is insane or stupid or wicked? That's what he says. I mean he's not open minded at all. The worst part is his arrogance and conceit. Just a little man who can easily be picked apart by arguments and especially physically by the very people he insults. Of course he has to hide behind books. I feel bad for him and I'd laugh in his face if he attempted to ridicule me. I'd look at him and laugh.

So - how to creationists explain the following set of observations?

1) Almost 70% of mutations are cytosine to thymine deaminations

2) Human de no vo mutations in our species reflects this predominance of cytosine to thymine deaminations

3) Comparison of human to chimpanzee genomes demonstrates the same predominance of cytosine -&gt; thymine deaminations

It is unintentional.

It is unpredictable.

What is left to distinguish an act as random?

I trust that nobody here will argue that the first definition of random applies to natural selection.

The second definition is proven applicable in the claim that evolution is without direction.  Any act that is without direction is unpredictable, which makes it random.  You cannot have it both ways.

Let me address a couple of anticipated objections.

1) Saying that a given creature will adapt to its surroundings in such a way that facilitates its survival is not the sort of prediction that proves the process is not random.  I might truly predict that a six-sided die will come up 1-6 if I roll it, but that does not make the outcome non-random.  

And in the case of evolution, I might not even roll the die if the creature dies.

And can you predict whether or not the creature will simply leave the environment altogether for one more suited to it?


2) That naked mole rat.  This is not a prediction based exclusively evolutionary assumptions but on the belief that creatures who live in a given environment will be suited to that environment, a belief which evolutionary theory and ID have in common. 
*The sort of prediction one would have to make is to predict the course of changes a given species will undergo in the future.*  I trust that nobody believes this is possible.

**But here is the essential point.**  Anyone who wishes to make a serious objection to my claim must address this, it seems to me: Everyone believes that mutation is random, and yet mutation is subject to the exact same four fundamental forces of nature that govern the circumstances of selection.  **If selection is not random which of these forces do not apply to those circumstances?**",199,1565720604,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/cpx5bm/why_i_think_natural_selection_is_random/

DebateEvolution,cnyl59,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,Musings on the momentum within science.,"Far too often deniers of science claim that invalid positions ranging from anthropogenic climate change deniers to creationists are being silenced.  Unsurprisingly the gatekeeper is never named, could it be the science overlords or possibly hypnotoad himself?  I guess we’ll never know. 

I’m not going to argue that there isn’t any truth to the old adage ‘Science advances one death at a time’.  Clearly scientists are human, egos, competitiveness, and yes, petty bickering slow the unstoppable force of progress. Sadly this means brilliant individuals do not live to see their groundbreaking ideas become accepted.

Ludwig Boltzmann is probably currently most famous for the  ‘Boltzmann Brain’ idea. He’s also know for his fierce debate with Ernst Mach over the existence of atoms.  The debate was settled by none other than Albert Einstein in 1905.  It’s unclear if Boltzmann was aware of Einstein’s work when he took his own life in 1906. 

Afred Wegener, veteran, explorer, meteorologist, and geophysicist published ‘Alfred Wegener’s Hypothesis on Continental Drift and Its Discussion in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen’ in 1912.  Sadly he passed away in an icy grave in the ill named Greenland, 30 odd years before this hypothesis would accepted.

Nicolaus Copernicus, unlike the above two legends, passed away peacefully  at the ripe age of 70. He passed in 1543, the same year his ‘De revolutionibus orbium coelestium’ argued for a heliocentric model.  While his work was considered excellent, it was not widely adopted until over 100 years later.  

I’d be remiss if we didn’t touch on Gregor Mendel, abbot of St Thomas’s abby in Brünn, and father of heredity.  He passed way from kidney failure in 1884, sixteen years before his work would be accepted.

Finally we have the grim case of Ignaz Semmelweis, an obstetrician. Semmelweis was quick to realize that when basic hygiene such as hand washing became procedure in hospitals, less people died. Sadly Semmelweis didn’t know about germ theory, and couldn’t describe the mechanism for his observations. As such his ideas were rejected.  Semmelweis took the rejection poorly, became depressed and began abusing alcohol.  In 1865 Ferdinand Ritter Von Hebra invited Semmelweis to go on a tour of a mental institute.  The tour was a rouse, Hebra planned to admit Semmelweis. Semmelweis quickly became wise to the plan, and attempted to escape. The guard quickly caught him, and beat him badly. Semmelweis died from his injuries two weeks later. Without Semmelweis pushing hand washing, deaths in the hospital climbed six fold. 

‘The Origin of Species’ (and of course ‘On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species’ by Wallace), stopped thousands of years of momentum, although sadly not before Darwin and Wallace passed. Although unlike atomic theory, plate tectonics, and germ theory, creationism still has faint memories of that momentum 150 years later. Creationists have had 150 years to prove evolution false, 150 years to publish a papers in support of their conjecture.  I posit to you creationists, that you cannot publish not due to a grand conspiracy, but because at the heart of the matter, creationism is simply a hypothetical, a fairy tail that you’re not ready to give up on.

Sounds promising, right? Many of us have been asking for a testable hypothesis for *years*, decades in some cases. Are we *finally* going to get one?

Haha. Of course not. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the ""hypothesis"" presented by Kirk Durston:

&gt;A unique property of intelligent minds is the ability to produce statistically significant levels of functional information as defined in the literature.

Okay, that's a hypothesis. How can we test this? Well, we can randomly generate some stuff, like nucleic acid sequences, and determine if they contain statistically significant levels of ""functional information"". If they do, then this hypothesis is falsified. That actually works. 

Let's see how Durston proposes we evaluate this hypothesis:

&gt;The hypothesis stated above provides the basis for a scientific method to test any effect to see if it required intelligence to produce.

&gt;&gt;Step One: Evaluate the level of functional information required to produce the effect.

&gt;&gt;Step Two: Determine if the level of functional information is statistically significant.

&gt;&gt;Step Three: If it is statistically significant, then we can infer that intelligence was required to produce the effect.

Oh. Ooooooooooooooh. That ""hypothesis"" quoted above? That wasn't a hypothesis. That was a *premise*. 

I'm not sure if Durston is just missing the logic, or actually thinks this is how hypothesis testing works, or something else, but this is *not* a way to detect design, since the method itself, which is assumed to be valid, is the thing up for debate when it comes to ""biological design"". If ""only intelligence generates functional information"" is your premise, you don't have a way to evaluate a design hypothesis.

DebateEvolution,ckfj5j,ThurneysenHavets,MA Historical Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,“Prehistoric archaeological cultures were simultaneous”. Welcome to another colossally ignorant YEC rationalisation.,"This is an argument I heard from a YEC friend in real life and I’d like to briefly rant about it.

The archaeology of prehistoric Europe is complex. There’s a succession of archaeological cultures, migrations, technological innovations, and so forth, many of which are conventionally thought to have *individually* lasted for thousands of years. YECs need to fit *all* of it, from Neanderthals to the Bronze Age, into the few centuries between the Tower of Babel and the beginning of recorded history. Which is... crazy.

Simple solution? Many of these societies coexisted; the periodisation is wrong; and it’s only the “evolutionists” who are reading lengthy timescales into it. CMI [confirms](https://creation.com/the-stone-age-a-figment-of-the-imagination) that this is not an isolated view.

Now the lovely thing about this argument is that we don’t even have to argue about absolute dating to show why it’s wrong. It’s so unutterably idiotic that we can debunk it with relative dating alone. And there are quite a few ways of proving that two societies weren’t contemporaneous.

Let's run over just a few.

- *Stratigraphy* is a mainstay of conventional archaeology. In the best case consecutive layers are *physically* superimposed on top of each other. You cannot simultaneously inhabit the building you’ve just destroyed to build a new one on top of. Seriously.

- *Carbon dating* is routinely used (and sometimes a range of other dating methods such as thermoluminescence, obsidian rim dating, etc.). You don’t have to believe these methods work to accept that they exclude the possibility of simultaneity. Even *relative* C14 tags up with stratigraphy ([this is an example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0A693962BF0D6970DB25CC20C74D8A83/S0003598X00069799a.pdf/sitagroi_radiocarbon_and_the_prehistory_of_southeast_europe.pdf)). A radiocarbon sample doesn’t know whether it’s supposed to be Chalcolithic or Bronze Age.

- *Technology* changes over time. Sure, different degrees of technological advancement can coexist, but there’s a limit to this explanation. To give just a single example, why do societies with evidence for wheel-related technology, for instance, *never* occur in Palaeolithic sites, if these coexisted with more advanced societies? Why does copper precede the (much superior for many purposes) bronze? ... and so forth.

- *Changes spread geographically*. For instance, the C14 dates for the earliest Neolithic sites grow [progressively younger as you go north-westwards](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/6456919/10.1.1.163.1621.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DNeolithic_transition_in_Europe_the_radio.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190728%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20190728T015636Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=2a3e441f4cba218c393601f2102b1a662ab177fb936d7482a46cd1dec6fb66bc), consistent with a gradual spread of agriculture from the Middle East. How is this supposed to work if these sites are basically simultaneous? Do C14 dates line up in geographical progression just to piss off YECs or what?

- *Migrations leave genetic evidence*. The Neolithic revolution may again serve as an illustration. It is accompanied by the arrival of [distinctive Middle Eastern haplogroups which are *absent* from Mesolithic forager populations](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/53061694/Anthony___Brown_2017_Molecular_archaeology_and_Indo-European_linguistics_last_proof.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMolecular_archaeology_and_Indo-European.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190728%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20190728T021910Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=969c51967fe5b8b14ebbc1cdbdfc81e749153e0110a3a116aa63b8248e770280). If the Neolithic revolution wasn't real - which is what the [""simultaneous"" bs pretty much explicitly implies](https://creation.com/a-better-model-for-the-stone-age) - there's no reason why Neolithic settlements should be marked by the arrival of a new group of people. (Also, obviously, migrations followed by interbreeding take time.)

- *Human settlements interact with the environment*. Just one example: [pollen samples](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034666717300209) may indicate the increasing presence of cultivated crops, or deforestation, and so forth, as human subsistence styles change. Obviously, an area is either forested or it is not. It cannot be both simultaneously. Thereby excluding any nonsense about the different societies associated with these subsistence styles having systematically coexisted.

And so forth and so on. The above obviously only scratches the surface. And again, it illustrates only the wrongness of the argument in *relative* terms, on the [completely academic assumption that absolute dating is unreliable](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c6ceiz/possibly_my_alltime_favourite_c14_dating_graph/).

So if any YEC wants to rise to the challenge: feel free. Give me an explanation – any explanation – for the lengthy prehistory you guys basically deny that isn’t *eyewateringly* idiotic, and I’ll be happy to discuss it.",19,1564612249,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ckfj5j/prehistoric_archaeological_cultures_were/

**GOD CREATED EVOLUTION.
**MRSA-RESISTANT VIRUSES, etc. are examples of evolution.[/QUOTE]

Unfortunately evolutionists forget that biology is really the child of organic chemistry. All biology fundamentally is organic chemistry and organic chemistry is atomic interactions.

Go look at nature and observe what nature outside of life aka plants and animals create. They never create anything complex. Even diamonds are just a single element squeezed together.

Everything in nature is either some element that is an Oxide or a chloride or a sulfite.

Never in nature does carbon exist in any form other than diamonds or graphite or carbon dioxide. Never in nature will you find hydrogen anywhere except in water. Nitrogrn doesn't react with anything most of the time. Oxygen destroys any organic molecules and also doesn't really react readily with it.

What's the point?

People like to run away and say that evolution simply deals with life only after it began, but in reality evolution starts with the big bang and includes everything after it.

Therefore, how can you ever in nature have any organic molecule even the simplest ones form such as ethanol or methane or ammonia? They never form.

Yet were supposed to believe out of no available chemicals somehow left handed amino acids formed and survived for millions of years... In an oxygen free environment which means there was no Ozone and thus UV light and even visible light would destroy those same amino acids. Then those amino acids formed proteins which we cannot even synthesize from scratch in the lab or even properly simulate how it folds in super computers. Remember PS3 and the app ""folding at home"". No one knew wtf it was but it was meant to simulate protein folding because it's that complex and needed that many computers to do it. Somehow though proteins that decay so fast formed and then survived. Then one day they needed to make impossible lucky arrangement of a sugar phosphate backbone which never happens in nature but there would need to be quafrillions of these molecules all at the same time and the atgc codons in dna had to somehow attach together and fold properly and then without a translate enzyme to define what those codes meant and a cell membrane to survive in or a chromosome for the DNA to be packed in, it survived and formed a ""simple cell"" which is more complex in sophistication and comparatively if compared with computer bits, orders of magnitude more complicated than any computer code ever, and then that dna survived and then somehow knew how to reproduce already because without reproduction it would die. Also it needed oxygen which oxygen is also just so unpleasant for life BTW. You see for millions of years they were still evolving the basic necessities to even exist at all so they all died until one of them finally made itself again from the ashes of the failed earlier cell experiments until it reproduced and got the hang of it until it divided in this soup and then got lost in the ocean as soon as it divided... It's single chromosome divided. And then it died.

Let's skip and imagine it succeeded. One day, an animal decided it needs eyes. How it could possible understand the need for eyes when early brains would be essentially equivalent and less intelligent than a 1980s 8 bit cpu but life found a way to evolve eyes slowly. Somehow while we like to imagine it could happen, no one ever ponders how nature could possible understand how to construct even the most basic light sensitive eye. Imagine, you would need to know what chemical material to use and how to connect that material with nerves to a central nervous system to process that info. Such an ""adaptation"" could not possible have happened since you can't adapt to something and create something new that you never knew existed. It's like if we ""adapted"" to be able to ""see"" or at least ""perceive"" radio waves or see the 4th dimension of time and witness the future but we wouldn't consciously try and ""adapt"" this ability but somehow subconsciously we would. And this boils down to the DNA having to make on its own, brand new code.. And we all know how even a single letter in a line or computer code can crash the software and likewise in animals just a few nucleotides aka the letters of the DNA being off is fatal. Somehow were to imagine evolution did this? Evolution is nothing more than God for atheists. Evolution+time for atheists can do what no intelligence on earth can. Actually tinker with and create new functionalities in organic beings via DNA when today we cannot synthesize in a lab basic proteins properly if at all much less far more complicated macro molecules or enzymes. DNA is so far out of our realm. The only thing we know about DNA is the chemical composition of the codons and the arrangement. We don't understand how those arrangements mean anything neither would we know how to synthesize dna since the way it folds is not possible for us to replicate in any lab at all. Even if we could Wed realize how nearly impossible it is for nature to do it unless it was programmed to do so. The only explanation how DNA even works is if our universe exists how a computer exists. In other words, anyone outside of the computer understands how to create a computer code and how it functions in 1s and 0s yet anything that runs off that code doesn't even comprehend that it's nothing but 1s and 0s. For all we know, dna exists because somewhere outside of our observable universe is the true translation matrix that enables a certain arrangements of chemicals in dna to even mean anything at all. But that's just an educated guess and this part isnt about evolution.

Point is evolution cannot happen because dna cannot permit it.

Furthermore. If evolution was true. We would only have either one chromosome that gets more and more complicated as each new species ""evolves"" and remember you can't have any errors or mistakes in the DNA or else it's death, or, each more advanced species should have more chromosomes than the last and any new information will always be found in the newest chromosome at the end of the nucleotide sequence, sort of like a book you keep adding too if it's one single chromosome or multiple volumes of books with each new volume indicating a new species and the newest chromosome would have the highest and most up to date species aka humans. Yet in nature we don't find this to be true. Some of the dumbest animals have double the chromosomes humans do. Similarities we claim exist between us and apes such as similar radius and ulna etc are found entirely in a different chromosome and the gene is found elsewhere. This goes against evolution entirely. Just think about it.

OH and I know someone will say chromosome count doesn't matter because the ""tree of life"" keeps branching off from each other, but even if this was the case, you would under your own evolutionary theory, expect that each line of the tree you follow the gene count and the chromosome number would go up. You cannot expect a tree wherein total gene count in all chromosomes and chromosome number should go up and down and up, and Gene count should go down at all. Losing entire chromosomes and genes is the opposite of evolution. It makes absolutely no sense. The genes for radius and ulna or the eyes between the supposed great ape family including humans are all found in different chromosomes and genes. Evolution would dictate that they would be found exactly in the same place. You cannot expect a progressive and linear progression if the chromosomes especially where the genes for certain parts are found are all over the place between supposed similar species. Also, the intelligence between our supposed great ape cousins compared to humans is so vastly different its unreal. DNA and chromosomes should have long ago given massive evidence towards evolution if we noticed the same tree of life growing in number of chromosomes or if we found the same genes that did the same thing between similar species such as humans and apes in the same place, but we do not. Not even close. Even a minor mutation in nucleotides can be fatal, there is nearly no possibility of change. Similarly like I said to a line of computer code. Mess up a single letter and tell me how your million character code breaks apart and fails.

If we are to believe fire is what made us ""evolve"", are you saying then we can teach apes how to make fire today and eventually they'd evolve ad well? Evolution dictates they must. Not to mention, if we could teach apes how to drive or all be experts in sign language like that one ape named coco which you can YouTube, according to evolutionary theory life experience can evolve a species especially if the entire population does similar things.

Therefore I say, there are elephants today that can draw perfectly. If all elephants today all were taught how to draw every day, by evolutionary thinking within even a hundred years of highly accelerated, population wide elephant training to teach them art, they should be able to naturally know how to paint if given the proper tools and their minds within a couple hundred generations should then be able to create Mona Lisa's and even better... Yet.. We just don't see this happen, and we won't. This isn't how it works in real life. I must admit even I can imagine that it would work because it sounds so good and seems to make sense so well especially if you sprinkle the magic ingredient of deep time but, sorry, it doesn't work. Therefore, humanity couldn't evolve to where it did today because of life experiences, and neither did giraffes evolve because they stretched their necks. I mean seriously just think about it. Where are the other giraffe species? Shouldn't there be dozens who all wanted to eat from that tree? The idea that needing to reach a tree thus evolving the ability sounds good in imagination land, but in reality, dna prohibits it. There is no change in dna period",90,1564572378,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ck76ug/analysis_on_how_organic_chemistry_complexity_of/

Months after Ken Ham's Ark Encounter was damaged by flooding, Ham argues we shouldn't be worried about climate change.","&gt;And there’s been climate change in the past. Of course, the biggest climate change was the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,350 years ago. This flood destroyed the world that then was and upset the climate... ... The world has been settling down since that flood.

&gt; And, even since the flood, we’ve seen other climate change events. There was a warming period during the Middle Ages that allowed farmers to settle and grow crops on Greenland—not something I suggest doing today! There was also a Little Ice Age in the 16th century that impacted agriculture significantly. And no one was driving cars, flying airplanes, or building factories back then!

No surprises that a man who ~~can't~~ won't understand the basic concepts of evolution will fail to understand the seriousness of climate change as well.

The difference being in this redditers opinions, creationists fall mostly on the humours side of science denialism, where as climate change denialism is a grave threat.

 As someone who began studying ToE, I still don't have many resources at hand. One of the things I have to constantly look for are transitional fossils between species.
 However, sometimes it's hard to find said fossils, whether that be due to the peculiarity of what I'm searching, or the inaccuracy of my browser engine.

  I am aware of Wikipedia's list, but it has yet to be professionally verified in some sections, and some of the sources were hard to verify.

 Thus, I humbly ask - Is there a complete list of the transitional fossils we've found, on the internet?

Thanks in advance.

DebateEvolution,chzpmp,Ch3shireDev,,t2_4323z6,self.DebateEvolution,,Fundamentalist view of Bible stories vs. The Parables of Jesus,"AFAIK in fundamentalist interpretation of Bible you treat all stories as they happened exactly as described and are historical fact. This makes a lot of friction between fundamental christian and scientific atheists, because if you treat the same way scientific data and biblical knowledge, sooner or later you have to throw one away. Atheists like Dawkins or Harris decide to throw away biblical data, creationists like Ken Ham are throwing away the evolutionary data.

The problem I have with that is the literal interpretation. I have the following analogy - Jesus told many parables to his apostles. They weren't described as ""ok, listen up, that thing didn't happened, I just want you to get the idea"". And everyone are perfectly okay with that, there is a great wisdom in those parables. I also think there is a great wisdom in Genesis, since it can be interpreted for many, many years and you still can't dry the drain. It just happens that it doesn't match the scientific data about geological history of the world. Just like Jesus stories doesn't match historical data (well, we don't know, but He didn't told them to describe some exact happening, but to teach).

**But when mutations don't get expressed because they are recessive, natural selection doesn't take effect.** 

Although this alone doesn't disprove evolution, this does have significant implications:

1. How evolution is taught in schools is misleading

2. Genetics isn't strong evidence for evolution unless you ignore information and logic that isn't convenient.

DebateEvolution,ch7fg1,ThurneysenHavets,MA Historical Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creation.com outdoes itself with its latest article. It’s not evolution, it’s... it’s... it’s a ""complex rearrangement of biological information""!","Okay, ""outdoes itself"" is perhaps an exaggeration; admittedly it sets a *very* high bar. Nevertheless yesterday's creation.com article is a bit of light entertainment which I thought this sub might enjoy.

Their [Tuesday article](https://creation.com/new-sugar-transport-gene-evolved-in-yeast) discusses [the creation of a brand new gene by the duplication and subsequent combination of parts of three other genes, two of which continue to exist in their original form](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1377697/pdf/9915938.pdf). Not only is this new information by any remotely sane standard, I’m pretty sure it’s also irreducibly complex. Experts in Behe interpretation feel free to correct me.

----

But anyway creation.com put some of their spin doctors on the job and they came up with this marvellous piece of propaganda.

- First they make a half-hearted attempt to imply the whole thing is irrelevant because it was produced through “laboratory manipulation.” This line of reasoning they subsequently drop. Presumably because it’s rectally derived? I can but hazard a guess.

- They then briefly observe that new exons did not pop into existence from nothing. I mean, sure, it’s important to point these things out.

- Subsequently they insert three completely irrelevant paragraphs about how they think ancestral *eubayanus* had LgAGT1. And I mean utterly, totally, *shamelessly* irrelevant. This is the “layman deterrent” bit that so many creation.com articles have: the part of the article that is *specifically* designed to be too difficult for your target audience to follow, in the hope that it makes them just take your word for it.

- God designed the yeast genome to make this possible, they suggest. I’m not sure how this bit tags up with their previous claim that it was only laboratory manipulation... frankly I think they’re just betting on as many horses as possible.

- And finally perhaps the best bit of all:

&gt;Yet, as in the other examples, complex rearrangements of biological information, even ones that confer a new ‘function’ on the cell, are not evidence for long-term directional evolutionary changes that would create a brand new organism.

Nope, novel recombination creating a new gene coding for a function which did not previously exist clearly doesn’t count. We’ll believe evolution when we see stuff appearing out of thin air, like evolutionists keep claiming evolution happens, and with a long-term directionality, like evolutionists keep claiming evolution has, to create “brand new” organisms, which is how evolutionists are always saying evolution works.

In the meanwhile, it’s all just “complex rearrangements of biological information.”",135,1563970591,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ch7fg1/creationcom_outdoes_itself_with_its_latest/
DebateEvolution,ch0nq1,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"From the echo chamber: ""Anyone ever heard a good argument from the evolutionists dealing with the mathematical problem of protein generation?""","Over at /r/creation, /u/espeakadaenglish posted [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cghk6v/mathematical_challenges_to_darwins_theory_of/eul9nz6/):

&gt; Anyone ever heard a good argument from the evolutionists dealing with the mathematical problem of protein generation? I mean if there is les than a 1 in 10 to the 37th power chance of generating one single new protein in the history of life on earth how do they expect to generate the thousands (millions?) that are found in living systems?

This is the problem with existing in echo chambers and ideological bubbles: You hear one side give an argument about a subject that you're not educated in, and you don't go investigate what others have to say about it, of course you think the argument that supports your beliefs has merit.

But the counter to this is: the argument is pure bullshit. And it's a PRATT: point-refuted-a-thousand-times.

The ""big number"" probabilities that creationists are so fond of are a complete misrepresentation of science and reality. The argument assumes that there's only one possible way to get something complex to form in nature: that it has to form on its own completely without any precursors, and has to be that exact result. The chance of this all happening is so extreme, it must be impossible without some divine help.

The best way to illustrate how bad this argument is is by using the lottery as an example. There's a jackpot drawing on a given night. The chance of any single ticket matching the necessary numbers, five randomly selected, unique balls numbered 1 through 69, then 1 randomly selected ball from another pool of those numbered 1 through 26, from this particular game is 1 in 292,201,338. So astronomical that it must be impossible to win.

And if you did win with your single ticket, it must be because someone cheated and matched your numbers, since the probability was too high for you to have won legitimately.

If you ignore all other aspects of how this works, you can see why this argument makes sense. However, multiple people win the jackpot throughout the year. How can that be if the jackpot is so impossible to win?

Just like with the protein, there are so many people playing the lottery, and playing in multiple drawings, and playing multiple tickets each time. At some point, with the number of attempts, tickets will match the jackpot, even though the numbers were unknown when the ticket was purchased and the balls were selected randomly.

This is similar to how nature works. There wasn't just one attempt to build a strand of DNA to form a protein. There wasn't a specific protein in mind when this attempt was made. There are trillions of bacteria alone living inside each human body. And that's not including the human cells and other organisms alive within each person.

Now imagine how little space those organisms must take up to fit inside a human, compared to how large the world is. Back when life was starting to emerge, the necessary building blocks to form those first organisms were abundant in the seas. How many different precursors were just forming RNA strands for other reasons, then how many times were those RNA strands replicating themselves with minor errors, and how many different possible outcomes there must be where eventually a protein could be transcribed from the RNA?

These replications happen dozens of times a day at least, over millions and millions of years, over trillions upon trillions of precursors to life, with minor errors happening all the time, until finally something forms that makes this particular precursor to life edge closer to what life could be. And one of those advantageous genes eventually becomes so successful that it becomes conserved and replicated throughout the ancestors' lineages of that original self-replicating precursor to life.

That ""big number"" probability argument falls apart quickly, just because it ignores all the possibilities that were available. It assumes that the protein being offered as the goal *IS* the only possible goal, that there was ever only one attempt to reach that goal, and that there was never anything before that single attempt.

Just like buying one ticket to one drawing for the lottery makes it almost impossible that someone will win the jackpot, once you realize how many people play, how often they play, and how many times they try each time they play, it becomes very apparent how people win jackpots even though no one's cheating the game.",71,1563926811,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ch0nq1/from_the_echo_chamber_anyone_ever_heard_a_good/

Iridium is an incredibly unique element. It rests on the periodic table with atomic number 77, and is the second densest metal present. It's also the most corrosion resistant metal, maintaining it's integrity at temperatures up to 2000 degrees Celsius.   


It also obliterates Young Earth Creationism.   


**Part 1: The Iridium Shortage**  


Our planet is abundant in many elements, particularly those conducive to life. But as everyone knows, there are elements that are rarer than others. Iridium fits into this category.   


This element one of the rarest of those found in Earth's crust. This means that it is essentially present enough to be considered among the crustal makeup, but practically it is very difficult to find. How rare are we talking here?   


Well [only 3 tons of iridium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium) are produced and consumed in the Earth's Crust annually.   


Gold is thus 40 times more abundant in comparison.   


What this means is that finding large quantities of this element is very rare, and when it occurs it is usually a big geologic deal. This is because large iridium deposits on our planet usually have an story to tell, as the element's presence is very much out of this world...",0,1563166123,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/cdd2ow/the_iridium_anomaly_and_earths_impact_events_both/

That's the level of ignorance and dishonesty in Reddit's premiere creationism subreddit.

Here we go:

&gt; But everyone believes in Evolution...

&gt; ... and for about 10 years, everyone also believed in Elizabeth Holmes and her amazing invention. In fact, by the end of 2010, Theranos had more than **$92 million** in venture capital. You’d think that millionaires would be far more conservative with their money, opting to invest only in safe enterprises, but, hey, *everyone’s* saying that Theranos is the real thing, there’s no way all these important people are grossly mistaken, right?

&gt; *Mutatis mutandis*, the same reasoning applies to scientific dogmas, as is the case of neodarwinism. Every scientist professing to believe that random mutations, carefully tailored by natural selection, can account for molecules-to-man Evolution does not make it any more true. Just as every member of the emperor’s court was adamant in their admiration for the monarch’s new clothes, scientists don’t want to be the ones identified as “ignorant, stupid or insane”. We are all humans, after all, and that, like you or not, is human nature.

&gt; We live in a time of too much conformism; “science has already explained almost everything, we are just missing some details”, “you should not worry about this, people figured it out long go”, “scientists say...”, etcetera. Although these statements try to invoke the “spirit of Science”, they have nothing to do with Science itself, for Science, as brilliantly stated Dr. Feynman, “is a culture of doubt”, therefore, peeking behind the curtains in order to see what the Great Wizard of Oz is up to should never be disencouraged.

But one user, /u/gmtime, goes one step further and says creationists shouldn't use the terms microevolution and macroevolution, but should instead use the terms ""observed mutation"" and ""inferred mutation."" Why? [Let's let him speak](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etl7nnu/):

&gt; That seems like a reasonable differentiation. Though it will cause lots of confusion. I'd drop the term evolution altogether and talk about mutation instead. Then it becomes observed mutation and inferred mutation, which actually point out what you're trying to talk about.

/u/apophis-pegasus rightly [corrects this argument](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etlg0aa/):

&gt; Mutation is not evolution though. Mutation is a source of variation.

And gmtime [punts this awfully ignorant argument into the sidelines](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cc0cea/for_those_who_think_micro_evolution_occurs_where/etllmn7/):

&gt; No it's not. Mutation is a gene changing in a way that it did not exist in the parents. Variation is a shuffling of the genes that do exist in the parents.

&gt; Example: a brown father with straight hair and a brown mother with curly hair get a brown kid with wavy hair is variation; the information for the waviness was already available in the parents. The same parents getting an albino kid is mutation; neither of the parents had genetic information that caused the skin to become white.

&gt; Evolution is the *theory* that a huge cascade of mutations will create all the different living organisms from the same (or same small set of) genetic root material.

&gt; Talking about micro vs macro evolution muddles the waters, because what's actually the question is whether (inferred) mutations actual do lead to evolution.

It's incredible that someone who knows nothing about biology is trying to argue that we should use new terms because ""evolution"" is confusing, all while not understanding how mutations, inherited traits, gene expression work, and also while arguing that mutations MAY NOT LEAD TO EVOLUTION!

DebateEvolution,ccx3rv,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,,"/r/creation: ""Behe Vindicated Again: Goldfish Are Broken Carp | Evolution News,"" or: How to lie to people who don't know much about science","Over at /r/creation, /u/MRH2 [posted about an article](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/cck85k/behe_vindicated_again_goldfish_are_broken_carp/) from the creation blog [EvolutionNews](https://evolutionnews.org/2019/07/behe-vindicated-again-goldfish-are-broken-carp/) about the goldfish genome and how it proves Behe was right.

What might have happened to cause this blog post? What was Behe right about?

The first paragraph of EN's blog post ends with this sentence:

&gt; Darwin’s mechanism did not create anything new; it broke things, but in the case of the polar bear, it worked out.

The premise being that Behe argues that intelligent design and not evolution explains the origins of life better. Yeah, that's what this whole thing is about.

Behe's *Darwin Devolves* has this paragraph describing the book on Amazon:

&gt; A system of natural selection acting on random mutation, evolution can help make something look and act differently. But evolution never creates something organically. Behe contends that Darwinism actually works by a process of devolution—damaging cells in DNA in order to create something new at the lowest biological levels. This is important, he makes clear, because it shows the Darwinian process cannot explain the creation of life itself. “A process that so easily tears down sophisticated machinery is not one which will build complex, functional systems,” he writes.

In order to make this argument, Behe attempts to find ""devolution"" in nature, by claiming that ""DNA is damaged."" 

&gt; Although Charles Darwin didn't mention [polar bears] in his 1859 masterwork, *On the Origin of Species*, the polar bear is a wonderful illustration of his theory of evolution by random variation and natural selection. Like other examples Darwin did cite, the giant predator is clearly related to a species that occupies an adjacent geographical area, while just as clearly differing from it in a number of inherited traits. It is easy to envision how the polar bear's ancestors might gradually have colonized and adapted to a new environment. Over many generations the lineage could have become lighter in color (making the bears less and less visible to their prey in snowy environments), more resistant to the cold, and more adapted to the sources of food in the Arctic, a process in which each step offered a survival advantage over the previous one.

&gt; Yet a pivotal question has lingered over the past century and a half: How *exactly* did that happen? What was going on within the bodies of the ancestors of the modern polar bear that allowed them to survive more effectively in an extreme climate? What was the genetic variation upon which natural selection was acting? Lying hidden deep within the genome of the animal, the answers to those questions were mysteries to both Darwin and subsequent generations of scientists. Only several years ago--only after laboratory techniques were invented that could reliably track changes in species at the level of genes and DNA--was the genetic heritage of the Arctic predator laid bare. The results have turned the idea of evolution topsy-turvy.

&gt; The polar bear's most strongly selected mutations--and thus the most important for its survival--occurred in a gene dubbed APOB, which is involved in fat metabolism in mammals, including humans.^1 That itself is not surprising, since the diet of polar bears containts a very large proportion of fat (much higher than in the diet of brown bears) from seal blubber, so we might expect metabolic changes were needed to accommodate it.

&gt; But what *precisely* did the changes in polar bear APOB do to it compared to that of other mammals? When the same gene mutated in humans or mice, studies show it frequently leads to high levels of cholesterol and heart disease. The scientists who studied the polar bear's genome detected multiple mutations in APOB. Since few experiments can be done with grumpy polar bears, they analyzed the changes by computer. They determined that the mutations were very likely to be *damaging*--that is, likely to degrade or destroy the function of the protein that the gene codes for.

&gt; A second highly selected gene, LYST, is associated with pigmentation, and changes in it are probably responsible for the blanching of the ancestors' brown fur. Computer analysis of the multiple mutations of the gene showed that they too were almost certainly damaging to its function. In fact, of all the mutations in the seventeen genes that were most highly selected, about half were predicted to damage the function of the respective coded proteins. Furthermore, since most altered genes bore several mutations, only three to six (depending on the method of estimation) out of seventeen genes were free of degrading changes.^2 Put differently, 65 to 83 percent of *helpful, positively selected* genes are estimated to have suffered at least one *damaging* mutation.

&gt; It seems, then, that the magnificent *Ursus maritimus* has adjusted to its harsh environement mainly by degrading genes that its ancestors already possessed. Despite its impressive abilities, rather than *e*volving, it has adapted predominantly by *de*volving. What that portends for our conception of evolution is the principal topic of this book.

Except, as one would find with any person like Behe who routinely lies and gets caught lying, [he is outright lying about the studies done on polar bears](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/is-polar-bear-apob-damaged/5725) noting that their mutations biochemically damaged the genes or degraded or destroyed the function of the proteins.

So how does EN think that Behe was vindicated after lying about polar bears in his book that they're touting?

&gt; So how did the genes change? Chen et al. tell what they found about the goldfish genome in their paper in Science Advances, “De novo assembly of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) genome and the evolution of genes after whole-genome duplication.” There are four things a gene can do if it is no longer alone:

&gt; * Both copies can be expressed.
&gt; * Non-functionalization (non-F): One copy can go silent and not be expressed.
&gt; * Sub-functionalization (sub-F): It can take on one of the functions the gene formerly had.
&gt; * Neo-functionalization (neo-F): It can evolve a new function.

&gt; The first two responses involve loss. But what about neo-functionalization? That sounds like gain. It sounds like some new function emerges out of the idle code of the gene copy. Is that what they found?

&gt; ...

&gt; The authors mention “neo-F” 27 times, but readers will look in vain for the key evolutionary words innovation or novel, as in some new, novel function arising that did not exist before. The word gain appears 21 times, but 16 of those appear in the ambiguous form “gain/loss.” So which is it? The paper is filled with jargon and charts, but they obscure the question of what really was gained, if anything.

Yep, that's a blog supposedly about scientific topics complaining that a scientific paper is ""filled with jargon and charts"" and not using colloquial terms that they demand to hear. That's how you cater to creationists: be ignorant and be absurd.

Also, EN is arguing that if one of the copies is no longer expressed, or is expressed with the original, that's a loss of function. The gene isn't functionless. It's either working (both copies are expressed) or its regulator is inhibiting its expression currently (non-functionalization). Neither one of these is a loss of function.

It's worth noting that the paper also calls ""Both copies can be expressed"" ""conserved coexpression of the two ohnologs."" I'm not sure why they decided to use the terms for the other three and their definitions, but not for the coexpression term.

Anyways, EN continues:

&gt; It seems they were most interested in writing statistics about which genes got turned on or off (i.e., which genes were “expressed”). At one point, they say, “We did not distinguish between gain and loss.”

Why would the paper say that they did not distinguish? Because for the purpose of why they did not distinguish it simply did not matter. The full quote is:

&gt; Goldfish-zebrafish chain-net alignment (&gt;20 kbp) was divided into two different sets, each representing the alignment between the zebrafish and one goldfish ohnolog. Exons/CNEs from goldfish were liftover to zebrafish based on the two chain-net alignments and annotated using Exon/CNE information of zebrafish, and an exon/CNE was considered as a loss in goldfish (or a gain in zebrafish) if less than 0.5 of the Exon/CNE was mapped to the genome of zebrafish. CNE liftovered to exons was considered as an exon instead of a CNE. The same process was applied for zebrafish exons/CNEs. Exon/CNE triplets with one zebrafish ortholog and two goldfish ohnologs were identified and mapped to gene pairs, and only unique one to two gene pairs were retained for further analysis. CNE was assigned to its nearest gene within 5 kbp (this window cover most of CNEs). The number and length of exons/CNEs in seven configurations were counted for each gene triplet: (ZF,GF1,GF2), (ZF,GF1), (ZF,GF2), (GF1,GF2), (ZF), (GF1), and (GF2), where (.) means that the exon/CNE exists in the corresponding genes. Length was calculated according to ZF exon/CNE if the ZF exon/CNE exists, otherwise according to GF1. Percentage for each configuration was computed as the length of the configurations divided by the total length of all configurations of the gene. Exon gain/loss (difference) between any gene pairs in each gene triplet was computed from the seven configurations, e.g., Dpercent(ZF,GF1) = Percent(ZF,GF2) + Percent(ZF) + Percent(GF1) + Percent(GF1,GF2), where Dpercent(ZF,GF1) is the exon gain/loss between ZF and GF1, Percent(.) is the percentage of the configuration. **We did not distinguish between gain and loss.**

Here they're comparing CNE % changes between the three genomes they were measuring, regardless of whether the exon was missing or added. This was just a measurement of change across genomes, and did not impact their studies on whether gene functionality was gained or lost through the rest of their study.

Once again, creationists attempt to be deceptive to win points by quote mining and hoping their audience never bothers to check the source.

EN continues:

&gt; It sounds like, in the end, they are only repeating the evolutionary dogma that gene duplication gives Darwinism a chance to tinker and create novelty. Neo-functionalization “has been proposed to be a critical evolutionary phenomenon” that drives evolution. It would be “a useful case to explore this evolutionary process.” Wouldn’t they have highlighted a new gene with some new function if they had found one?

But the paper wasn't trying to find new genes to highlight. It was measuring exactly what the title of the paper says it was: ""De novo assembly of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) genome and the evolution of genes after whole-genome duplication"" Evolution of genes is simply their change over time.

To EN's blog post again:

&gt; Let’s look for natural selection. The word “selection” appears only 3 times in the text, but those refer to “purifying selection” (keeping things the same), “strong selection to maintain dosage balance” (keeping things stable), or “negative selection” (preventing changes). There was no mention of “positive selection” that would indicate something new or improved had arisen. Even the word adapt does not appear in the text, except in the references.

Because they weren't looking for something new or improved. They were just looking for changes and how those changes accumulated over time since the genome of the carp and goldfish had a duplication event. It is boggling that creationists refuse to see through this tripe.

EN continues:

&gt; “It would be easy to imagine,” in short, that gene copies “may” neo-functionalize. Science is supposed to proceed by demonstration, not by imagination. Even so, they are only imagining how the changed expression of existing genes could affect body form. Thus, goldfish are smaller than carp. Most of the known varieties of goldfish have arrived by human breeding, which is intelligent design.

Once again, we have creationists arguing that non-absolute words are in the realm of fairy tale thinking, rather than how science works. There aren't absolutes in science, and no one is going to state unequivocally that something is this way or something happened this way. These inconclusive terms are beneficial in that they show what the authors think happened **based on the evidence they have**. They can and should only form these conclusions based on all their available data and not based on what they hope is the result. Each time a creationist attempts to argue that a paper's conclusion is weaker due to terms like ""may"" and ""easy to imagine"" and so forth, they're hoping that you don't notice that no creationist has ever been able to bring up evidence and show objectively how it points to a creator's actions or a creator's existence.

EN rambles on:

&gt; Behe Vindicated

&gt; So how are goldfish like polar bears? They evolved primarily by loss.

Except the paper that they cited and their entire argument do not support this conclusion. Goldfish did not evolve primarily by loss. EN invented ways that they can state something is a ""loss,"" ignored all the times function was gained in the genome after the duplication because they couldn't find the terms ""novel"" and such, and rambled on about how a paper finding out how genomes changed over time couldn't cite any new gene functions that the paper never set out to find.

To me, this seems like science is vindicated against hacks like Behe, who even at the Dover trial had to admit that he makes up things just so his ideas have any merit. Hell, most of the Discovery Institute refused to testify under oath in support of intelligent design. Because EN's authors, like the rest of the DI, know they're lying to their readers and don't want to be hauled off to jail for perjury.

And finally, EN concludes:

&gt; Copy number variations do not add information. They just change the expression levels of existing information. By breaking or blunting existing information, polar bears get by in the white, cold arctic where the only thing to eat is a seal or fish. If that is what Darwin meant by natural selection, goldfish and polar bears will never evolve human brains.

Except that duplicating information is adding information, by definition. How can a new copy of a gene just be a change in expression level of existing information if the gene could coexpress, for example, or sub-functionality, where a gene expresses a different function it once had? How does one ""break"" ""existing information""? And only creationists would argue that anyone expects goldfish and polar bears to evolve human brains.

Well, it isn't. 

In order to be a scientific theory, as oppsed to a theory in the coloquial sense, or a hypothesis, or a guess, an idea must:

1) Explain observations. A scientific theory must mechanistically explain a wide range of observations, from a wide range of subfields. For example, relatively explains the motion of planets and stars.

2) Be testable and lead to falsifiable predictions. For example, if relativity is correct, then light passing by the sun on its way to Earth must behave a certain way. 

3) Lead to accurate predictions. Based on a theory, you have to be able to generate *new* hypotheses, experimentally test the predictions you can make based on these hypotheses, and show that these predictions are accurate. Importantly, this can't be post hoc stuff. That goes in (1). This has to be *new* predictions. For example, relatively led to a test of light bending around the sun due to gravity, and the light behaved exactly as predicted. 

4) Withstand repeated testing over some period of time. For example, a super nova in 2014 was a test of relativity, and had the results varied from what was predicted based on relativity, we'd have to take a good look at relativity and either significantly revise it, or reject it altogether. But the results were exactly as predicted based on the overarching theory. All scientific theories must be subject to constant scrutiny like this.

This is a minor update to the last section, in which /u/nomenmeum demonstrates he doesn't understand gene knockouts, irreducible complexity or scientific method, and insisted that a flawed experiment would be enough to prove the argument.

As well, he then neutralized one potential evolutionary pathway against his irreducible flagella by suggesting that the secretor system we think it evolved from could be a devolved version of the flagella, and that it is on us to prove that it isn't. Literally, he thinks that's a ""valid challenge to evolutionists"", creationists sure have it easy.

And no, that doesn't break irreducible complexity. Somehow. I think through self-delusion.

Has anyone ever noticed that none of these are new examples? It's always creationists citing some work they did in their glory days and then pretending that no one ever wrote scathing criticisms about them in the first place.

Anyway, now he's citing [this POS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2286568/) by Behe and David Snoke, in which they disprove evolution by claiming that a population count of 10^17 is a ridiculous figure.

You might recognize this article, it was involved in the ID trials back in 2005 -- yes, creationists are citing papers that have been pretty much debunked for over a decade -- at which Behe realized that while his God might be believed on faith, trials operate a little differently:

&gt;""A review of the article indicates that it does not mention either irreducible complexity or ID. In fact, Professor Behe admitted that the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were used.""

It seems like he might have been worried about perjury, because at trial, he had to admit that the conclusion he reached *might have been a little bit of a stretch*. It turns out he might have left out a few evolutionary pathways, and that 10^17 is actually a fairly small population --  that's actually only a few hundred liters of bacterial culture, which is not that unreasonable a thing on a planet this size.

Anyway, here's to 20 years of saying the exact same, discredited things and getting away with it, book by book, as creationists fail to realize Behe hasn't actually had to do any work in decades, except collect speaking fees for telling people what they want to believe.

I find that hard to believe and I'll list the points below.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Evolutionary Tree**

For example, evolution has a tree which represents all life on earth and the different branches show the divergence of life but whenever a paleontologist finds a new fossil, it generally leads to changing the tree to fit the new evidence. However sometimes another scientist will have a completely different view by comparing the fossil's anatomy with genetic evidence and sometimes they conflict. Then another event happens where another fossil is found which leads to the original tree being replaced with another one which fits the new evidence and of course not all scientists will agree and they'll have their own versions too. Of course it could be that we are continually improving on previous evidences and we are slowly getting there but saying 'the fossil record proves evolution' is kinda jumping the gun when you are still developing the evolutionary tree.

&amp;#x200B;

**Transitional Fossils**

Transitional Fossils are Fossils bridging the gap between different species of animals. Obviously there's a lot more to it than that but it's the general principle. Now fossils are rare therefore the fossil record is incomplete but I'm not going to focus on that. To explain, let's say we have 4 fossils, fossil A, B, C &amp; D. Fossil A, B and C have been discovered but D is yet to be discovered. Fossil A is dated at 3 million years, B at 2 million years and C at 1 million years. Fossil B shares 50% of it's characteristics of A and 50% of it's characteristics of C.  This is the current model of evolution for this situation;

*A evolves into B.*

*B evolves into C.*

Now in this situation fossil B is the transitional fossil and this makes sense. However now, fossil D is discovered and it has been dated to 4 million years ago and shares 100% of it's characteristics to B. Therefore the evolution model as shown above is thrown into disarray because why are we finding the transitional form from A to C, 1 million years before A comes into existence? Scientists can't ignore this therefore they have to change the Evolutionary Tree to fit this. This situation does happen quite often in Evolutionary Biology and I will show quite a common example, the Archaeopteryx (I'll refer to it as 'Arch').

The Arch is a species of dinosaur (there is a dispute whether it is a bird or not) and the first fossil was discovered at the time Charles Darwin published his book in 1861. This was hailed as the one of the first transitional fossils showing a transition between reptiles and birds but what is the consensus now? I have linked an article to Nature [here](https://www.nature.com/news/2011/110727/full/news.2011.443.html) and it argues that the Arch was more closely related to the Velociraptor and probably isn't a bird. It says this because we have a greater understanding of dinosaurs and their biology and that we realized the Arch wasn't much different to a typical dinosaur. So what is the point here?

Well if we go back to the basic example of fossil A evolving into B and then B to C, we can think of fossil A as a reptile, fossil B as the Arch or the supposed transitional fossil and C as a modern bird. From our limited knowledge here, it makes sense that B is the transitional fossil. However once we discovered D which is a dinosaur that shares very similar characteristics to B before A even had evolved, it disproves that B is a transitional fossil.

This raises the question of what even a transitional fossil is. When you say something is in transition, you are saying it's changing from X to Y but how can you say something is in transition if you are not sure which one of the species is in transition towards the supposed species you are saying it evolved to? Now some say that because you can see lots of species sharing similar characteristics between point X and point Y, it suggests one of them must have evolved to Y but this is wishful thinking. How do you know that a species supposedly between X and Y isn't just totally independent of either and follows a completely different line?

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I conclude then that the statement 'The fossil record proves macro-evolution' isn't a valid statement. I can appreciate that the fossil record may support macro-evolution but saying it proves it is not provable at the moment especially when our view of life is constantly improving. It would be like you saw a man in location A wearing a red polo and some jeans and then you go on vacation to location B and you see another man wearing a red polo and some jeans and you say 'It must be the same man.' How can you say that for certain? To definitely prove the man is the same man, you need to get a good look at him to see if it's the same face and then talk to him and ask him if he was in location A and then you can determine if he was the same man.

They found that “the evolutionary potential of a population **depends significantly**on its **preexisting** genetic diversity.” Selection of existing genetic variation is likely to swamp new beneficial mutations, because “**a high level of standing variation may allow a faster response to environmental changes than waiting for appropriate mutations to arise.**” Understandably so.""",6,1562297861,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c9b8xk/are_most_of_the_new_adaptations_actually_derived/

But this is a 180 from the truth.

Given a recent post there:

[Thoughts on ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed"" documentary/movie?](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/c8ktvs/thoughts_on_expelled_no_intelligence_allowed/)

After a day, there are eight comments posted, six of which are visible (and two locked away awaiting moderator approval, most likely).

This is an echo chamber. Every post there, including one from a moderator of /r/creation, extol how great Expelled is, and how it proves that the scientific community conspires to keep creationism out of science.

Except that the farce of a movie lied to scientists to get them involved in the production, creatively edited their conversations so that it appeared that they supported intelligent design, and even fabricated or misrepresented what happened to creationists in the film.

Numerous sources have shown that the claims and misrepresentations in the film have no bearing on reality. This site compiles many of the links: https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/expelled-exposed/

Unfortunately, expelledexposed.com is down, perhaps because it's been 11 years since the film premiered and it's been destroyed one hundred ways to Sunday.

But here we are, an ""open debate"" subreddit praising a film that lies throughout, and not giving anyone the ability to point out how many things that the film gets wrong. It reinforces creationists' beliefs that their ideology is being censored in science unfairly and anyone who dares to question evolution is immediately shunned.

And the truth is far from that claim. How many people viewing that subreddit will get to know this? Not many. How many people will go to that thread and confirm their beliefs that scientists are afraid of creationism? Probably all of them.

This is why echo chambers are bad, and this is especially why /r/debateevolution is not an echo chamber. Bring to this subreddit your evidence for creationism or show verifiable evidence that evolution is wrong, and we will listen and scrutinize your claims.

But if you're just bringing the same tired arguments like what Expelled featured, yeah, we're just not going to deal with that. Why should we?

We have a creationist arguing that without every step of a process that we know can happen and can see examples of the various steps in other bacteria, then it's just a fairy tale and a faith-based claim. A rational person asks if the individual steps needed to go from the basic pieces to the fully-functioning flagellum were mapped out, would the creationist give up creationism?

One might think that there should at least be, ""I'd be willing to reconsider my beliefs"" since those beliefs partially hinge on this one item being irreducibly complex. Not with a creationist, though.

Look. We've been down the irreducible complexity rabbit hole several times. The problem is that, depending on how the concept is defined, it's either [irrelevant, unfalsifiable, or false.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61nda6/the_irreducible_complexity_is_not_a_valid/) Picking out an example where we don't yet have a step-by-step account of its evolutionary history doesn't change that. The way science, real science, works is you take a hypothesis and poke and prod to find a counterexample that falsifies it. If you can't, you can say ""hey, this might be true"".

Well, HIV-1 group M Vpu falsifies irreducible complexity. Lambda phage [falsifies](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b01xml/novel_irreducible_functionality_in_lambda_phage/) irreducible complexity. 

You can throw around words like ""unreasonable"" or ""improbable,"" but to do so you must ignore the *actual examples of ""irreducible"" features evolving* that we've observed.

Oh? *Some* irreducible features can evolve, but others, like the flagellum, are too complex? That's an unfalsifiable argument from ignorance.

Footnote: The *E. coli* flagellum isn't irreducible; a step-by-step pathway to the present structure isn't the requirement to make that claim.

As far as I understand that simply isn't true what is selected for is whether the organism successfully procreated and their offspring survived to procreate etc.

Say for example you had a fly that lived for 18 months and only mated and layed eggs around the 12-13 month mark with the young being completely precocial. If there was mutation in an individual that shortened their life span to only 14 months the theoretical creationist may scream that it's a sign that the species degrading. Yet from a fitness point of view it's entirely neutral, it might suck for the fly but it was no less successful than it's 18 month old siblings. It may even be more successful because if the mutation becomes dominant in the population then the young have less competition for food.",7,1561779162,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c6tx23/trend_ive_noticed_of_some_creationists_equating/
DebateEvolution,c6ceiz,ThurneysenHavets,MA Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Possibly my all-time favourite C-14 dating graph. Young Earth Creationists, I'd love to hear how you explain this.","First, a bit of background. Ramsey et al. (2010) presents the results of the Oxford C-14 lab’s attempt to use radiocarbon dating to decide between various possible interpretations of Ancient Egyptian chronology.

For our purposes, however, it is more interesting to note that from the New Kingdom onwards, Egyptian history is actually rather accurate to begin with. It is pretty well fixed in relation to other chronologies, some of which can be pegged to astronomical events such as solar eclipses. This means that, rather than using C-14 to test Egyptian history, for the New Kingdom *we can also use Egyptian history to test C-14*.

For the non-Egyptologist, therefore, this article is a beautiful test of the reliability of C-14, and thus also of the dendrochronological record by which it is calibrated. Creationists are deeply sceptical of both. So here we have a testable creationist claim: if C-14 and dendrochronology are flawed we have no reason to suppose they will align well with known historical dates from the Egyptian New Kingdom, 3000 years ago (which is, after all, only about a thousand years later than the global flood).

[The graph shows otherwise]( https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AWUC_enBE803BE810&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=722&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=g0YVXezUJb2HwPAP-7yH6A8&amp;q=Radiocarbon-Based+Chronology+for+Dynastic+Egypt&amp;oq=Radiocarbon-Based+Chronology+for+Dynastic+Egypt&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24.39783.39783..40011...0.0..0.118.118.0j1......0....2j1..gws-wiz-img.1h3deCeCZdo#imgrc=Tz9T3LcYSD_ixM:). The correspondence between the mean radiocarbon dates and Shaw’s consensus chronology (the red line) is breathtakingly close – to a range of about ten to twenty years. That’s a margin of error of less than 1%. Even if you assume Shaw’s chronology is incorrect and take the competing chronology of Hornung et al. (the blue line) it doesn’t make that much difference.

I have a copy of Hornung et al. on my desk and their chapter on radiocarbon dating specifically states (p353) that their chronology for this period is established by regnal dates and astronomy *separately* to any secondarily corroborated C14 dates. So we really talking about an independent check here.

------

Why is this a problem for the creationist? Well, many of these methods stretch much further back than 3,000 years. Dendrochronology can be traced to the Holocene/Pleistocene boundary, twice as far as the YEC’s age for the planet. C14 can be used up to 75,000 years ago.

Creationists try to explain these problems by assuming, for instance, massive double ring growth for dendrochronology (ignoring the fact that double ring growth is actually less common than ring *skipping* in the oaks used for the Central European chronology, but never mind) or that C14 is somehow massively affected by the flood (again, ignoring the fact that even raw C-14 data still tags up pretty well – about 10% IIRC – with calibration curves). None of these solutions actually work, but ignoring that detail, here we have a nice proof that they have no practical effect on our ability to date stuff of a known historical age.

The only remaining option for the creationist, therefore, is to cram all the “wrongness” of the mainstream model into the few centuries between the flood and the New Kingdom. To assume that multiple methods which are spine-tinglingly accurate until the first millennium B.C.E. go completely and totally haywire in the centuries preceding, where we (rather conveniently for the creationist) can no longer test them against the historical record with the same degree of accuracy.

To me such an ad hoc assumption is even less believable than the already far-fetched YEC claims about dendrochronology and C14.

-----

Short addendum to this: I’ve just discovered, to my great amusement, that YECs have created their own C-14 calibration curve which fits with biblical chronology.

DebateEvolution,c4i3xh,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Dear Creationists: Please explain how abiogenesis is either impossible or so highly improbable to be impossible?,"Abiogenesis is not evolution, but creationists, especially at /r/creation, think that arguing against abiogenesis invalidates evolution as well.

So let's go with the question of this post:

Please explain how abiogenesis is either impossible or so highly improbable to be impossible?

It only becomes that once a person assumes that life must have arisen with absolutely nothing before it as a precursor. But we have viruses. Viruses have heritable traits. They replicate (through another host). They can evolve during their reproduction. But they are not alive. They're missing some key components of life.

So what's to stop a cell from being a non-living cell before it gets all the hallmarks of what we think a living cell needs to have? What if it has the cellular membrane? Heritable traits in the form of RNA or DNA? It absorbs proteins through its wall to help repair itself? It can get rid of waste through its membrane? And it can replicate by duplicating its genetic material and splicing into two?

What it can't do yet is metabolize for energy, still requiring it from an outside source. By what we know of living cells, this is not only an important aspect, but also required for what we consider ""life"" to have.

So it has all the components except for one for a living cell. Therefore, it's not one yet. Why do creationists think that this one-step-away non-living cell couldn't possibly have ever existed?

Why not two? Take away the cell replicating itself. And further down.

Each of these processes we observe in nature and in labs in far simpler constructs, even in non-living entities. Non-living cell gets a protein through its membrane that acts as a catalyst to start synthesizing replication of genetic materials? Now it can split into two. Non-living cell gets a tiny organelle that can convert a chemical process into energy for the cell itself? Now it can fully metabolize.

Steps, that's how evolution works, and that's what we're looking at when we study abiogenesis.

So, creationists, why do you insist that these steps can never happen or are impossible to exist? Why do you keep arguing that abiogenesis is so improbable or that it is impossible?

Please explain your position by arguing, with facts and reason, why the steps toward a living cell cannot have ever happened.",126,1561349851,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c4i3xh/dear_creationists_please_explain_how_abiogenesis/

It's an interesting take I think may be nice to have on hand when discussing Scriptural Inerrancy and Authority with any Christian, as well as the notion that our interpretations are never really set in stone. 

Whether religious or not, it's a fascinating read for anyone remotely interested in biblical interpretation.

I've pasted an excerpt below that I found neat:

""What about God's creative relation to the realm of organic things? Does the Bible provide any examples of God's *directly* creating living phenomena where scientists would now describe such origins *via* “naturally occurring” processes? Within the realm of living things, the Bible speaks of God *directly* orchestrating the events whereby each individual human being comes into existence. In Psalm 139:13–16, we read: “You knit me together in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made (*asah*)… My bones were not hidden from you, When I was being made (*asah*) in secret.” Again, Isaiah 44:24 declares: “Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and the one who formed (*yatsar*) you from the womb”; Isaiah 49:5 says: “And now says the Lord, who formed (*yatsar*) me from the womb to be His Servant,” and Isaiah 44:2: “Thus says the Lord who made (*asah*) you and formed (*yatsar*) you from the womb.” The Hebrew word “made” (*asah*) used in Isaiah and in the Psalms to describe the process of God creating or forming babies in the womb is the same word Scripture uses to describe God's creating or forming of lightning, the sun, and the stars. But, we might inquire, does God really *directly* create babies and form them in the womb? Do we really believe that God *directly* created each of us in our mother's womb?

According to science, the development of a human being in the womb is an exquisitely intricate and delicately organized phenomenon of which we know numerous details. “Development from zygote to embryo to fetus to independent animal is a dynamic and carefully orchestrated phenomenon that involves numerous simultaneous processes that occur in specific sequences and at particular times.”[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Ronald D. Hood, *Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology: A Practical Approach, Second Edition* (New York: Informa Healthcare, 2005), 154.View all notes Developmental biologists have uncovered many of the extremely complicated particulars of this process (called ontogeny) through which two single cells join and develop to become an extraordinarily complex multicellular organism called a human being. According to science, the formation of a baby in the womb is a *process* and *not* an instantaneous *event*. As everyone knows, fully developed babies are not created *ex nihilo* (out of nothing) at the moment of conception. If we believe that this developmental process described by science is how each human comes into being, and if we also believe that God directly creates each human person, then it would seem that God directly creates each individual human person through the biological process of ontogeny. Through the eyes of faith, we affirm that God is at work in every detail of this process—even though we can describe it with the help of science.

Having explored the language that Scripture uses to describe the ultimate physical origins of the things that science knows something about, we may go on to ask about the language that Scripture uses to describe the origins of things which occurred without leaving a directly observable record either in the present (e.g. ultrasounds of a developing embryo) or in the past (e.g. starlight from distant ancient galaxies). How did God originally create plant life? We read in Genesis 1:11: “Then God said, ‘Let the earth produce vegetation, plants yielding (*asah*) seed, and fruit trees bearing (*asah*) fruit after their kind, with seed in them, on the earth’”; in Genesis 1:12: “And the earth made (*yatsar*) vegetation, plants yielding (*asah*) seed after their kind, and trees bearing (*asah*) fruit, with seed in them, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.” Notice that the same Hebrew words (*yatsar*and *asah*), which are used to describe the process of a baby being formed in the womb and a star being formed, are used here to describe God's creation of plant life. If we are to interpret Scripture with Scripture, then this would imply that God created plant life through a process of some length rather than in an instantaneous event. Notice also that the grammatical subject in Genesis 1:12 that does the actual “creating” or “making” of the plants is the “earth.” This is not a novel observation, but one that goes back almost 2000 years into interpretive history. For example, Basil of Caesarea (c. 330) understood these verses as saying that God gave the *very earth* the power to create (*yatsar*) plant life.[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil, Hexaemeron 8:1.View all notes For Basil and other early Christians. God created creation to be creative and bestowed it with a good degree of autonomy.[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)See Christopher Kaiser, *Creation and the History of Science* (Eerdmans, 1991).View all notes Nature, says Basil, once created and put into motion, evolves in accordance with the laws assigned to it without interruption or diminishment of energy; and he compares the regular laws and cycles of nature to a spinning-top that continues in motion after the initial twist. Interpreting Genesis 1:11 *literally*, Basil says, “it is this command which, still at this day, is imposed on the earth and, in the course of each year, displays all the strength of its power to produce herbs, seeds, and trees. Like tops, which after the first impulse continue their evolutions, turning upon themselves, when once fixed in their center; thus nature, receiving the impulse of this first command, follows without interruption the course of ages until the consummation of all things.”[6](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil, *Hexaemeron* 5:10.View all notes

How then, according to Scripture, does God create animal life? In Genesis 1:24 we read “And God said, ‘Let the earth make (*yatsar*) living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.’ And it was so. God made (*asah*) the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.” And in Genesis 2:19: “Out of the earth the LORD God formed (*yatsar*) every beast of the field and every bird of the sky.” Here, the same Hebrew words (*yatsar* and *asah*) which describe the 9-month-long process of development from two single cells to a fully formed human being is used to describe the earth's creation of the different types of animals in direct response to God's command. Again, in the phrase “Let the *earth* make living creatures” (Gen. 1:24), we may ask: What is the grammatical subject of *yatsar*? *What* does the actual creating? According to Basil of Caesarea, God literally empowered (and continues to empower) the very Earth with the creative ability to produce such animals. Basil compares God's command to Earth to a ball that continues to roll down an inclined plane without further assistance. And he even describes the spontaneous generation of animal life from earth as a response to God's command: “God who gave the command \[to the Earth\] at the same time gifted the Earth with the grace and power to bring forth… even unto this day, some creatures, like insects and frogs, are produced spontaneously from soil.”[7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2013.750958#)Basil *Hexaemeron* 9:2; Lactantius (c. 240–320) likewise did not discount the possibility that some animals could be spontaneously generated.View all notes

From a consideration of Scripture alone, then, it would seem that there must be something in the original creation of plant and animal life that is akin to the development of an embryo in the womb. We might wonder whether a scientific survey the evidence of Earth's past reveals any hint that the development of plant and animal life is analogous to the embryological development of an individual human being. Are *yatsar* and *asah* the *scientifically* appropriate ancient Hebrew words to describe God's creation of babies, plants, and animals? Scientifically speaking, the overall picture we get from the fossil record is that the emergence of plant and animal life happens through a sequence or a process where there is at first no sign of life, then single-celled organisms appear (prokaryotes—without nuclei), then eukaryotic organisms, and these are followed by more complex multicellular creatures (plants and animals). Under conditions that have existed on Earth for at least the last billion years, all living organisms appear to have arisen from previously living organisms in such a way that the present complex living forms have developed by an unbroken and continuous process from the simplest living forms of the pre-Cambrian era. In other words, in the emergence of plant and animal life through earth history, we find the same general trajectory as in the formation of an embryo in the womb: first single cells, then multicellularity, and then more complex organisms. *Yatsar* and *asah*, then, would seem to be the best words in Hebrew to describe the empirically observed process through which complex plants and animals are directly formed by God through time.""",7,1560496381,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c0h5sp/an_interesting_paper_that_explores_the/
DebateEvolution,c0h2tb,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Fossil Graveyards: How they Preclude a Global Flood and Young Young Earth Creationism,"As usual, the primary contender rising up and blocking Young Earth Creationism as a hypothesis with legitimacy is the dynamic duo of Geology and Paleontology. 

Which is why today we're discussing Fossil Graveyards, a type of Paleontologic formation frequently used *by* ""Flood Geologists"" in favor of Global Cataclysmic Flood. As we will see in the following post, this could not be further from the truth: the unique type of death assembly so cherished by those in favor of a Global Noachian Deluge directly precludes the event's existence. 

Let's dive in!

**Part 1: Taphonomy and The Types of Fossil Graveyard**

Taphonomy is a field in Paleontology that concerns itself with how things die. More specifically, the factors and events leading up to death (habitat and climate), burial/lack thereof (postmortem transport, decay, local scavengers) and fossilization processes (diagenesis and pressure). 

Naturally then, this science is really quite important to the realm of Paleontology and Geology (the latter insofar as the two fields can and do tend to inform one another).

But so frequently ""Flood Geologists"" will write on the subject as though mainstream Paleontologists and Geologists are completely ignorant of the processes that impact the preservation of life, while in the same breath providing hefty evidence they themselves don't know the first thing about it: 

*""When we see fossilization world-wide, when we note that the water is the agency that has presented the conditions for fossilization, then we must conclude that there was a world-wide water cataclysm in the past""* 

This is Randy Wysong, a YEC Veterinarian and Flood Geology Advocate. Not, mind you, a Geologist or a Paleontologist. If he were, he would notice the absolutely innumerable examples of arid fossilization, sometimes known as [desiccation](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/paleo/fossilsarchive/drydes.html). Or perhaps the preservation seen through freezing and encased in peat bogs and amber? Or perhaps the numerous trace fossils seen in gentle seafloor footprints. But Wysong continues: 

*""The geological column is not a record of the coming of life, it is a record of it's going, it's departure, it's demise. The scientific community is not naive to this evidence. Some simply shelf it or ignore it to maintain the doctrine of uniformitarianism.""*  

This prevailing attitude of ""Flood Geology"" is persistent among YEC's, interpreting nearly every fossil find dated from the Cambrian to the Cretaceous as a result of the Flood. [Gnawed-on bones](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/10/18/juvenile-dinosaur-ceratopsian-bite-marks/#.XQMyWIhKhEY) of a long dead cerotopsian or the tell-tale-teeth-marks of [cannibalistic theropods](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/teeth-marks-discovered-on-bone-fossils-show-dinosaur-species-was-cannibal-113508.html) must be ***uniformly reinterpreted*** to reflect an answer already in mind: a rapid death and burial by a catastrophic flood some 2000-4000 years ago.

This is all due to a lack of understanding, education or pure dismissal of Taphonomy. Of course, I imagine they would trust the same principles applied to a crime scene. 

There are Three Types of Fossil Graveyard, but all are used to make the same point by ""Flood Geologists"", that point being thus: The Flood buried these organisms. 

If the organisms are fragile and easily destroyed by rough water, the flood was so immensely fast and catastrophic it instantly buried these creatures, even as to preserve their finer features. 

If the organisms are jumbled in a mass and dis-articulated, well, the flood did that too: no truly natural process can explain the power with which these organisms were torn to shreds. 

You're probably wondering, can it be both? And as we will prove here in a moment: No. No it actually cannot be both. It can only be either, and only on a small scale. 

Fossil Graveyards come in three varieties: 

\- Localized Natural Traps which include tar pits, caves, fissures and dried up watering holes. These are the very local, and they are typically not the result of a ""one time event"".

\- Widespread Regional Accumulations are a result of climate or habitat and include lagoons, river deltas and steppe environments. These appear to map patterns in local change, such as an ephemeral lake or the repeated massing of frozen organisms in the cold. 

\- Truly Catastrophic, but Spatially-Restricted Death Assemblages occur when there is a massive impact on a moderately sized area. Volcanic Eruptions, Landslide and yes, Floods are included in this. 

But ""Flood Geologists"" appear to ignore the distinction, and lump ALL the categories into the big arching title: Fossil Graveyards. This is usually accompanied with the notion that these events are inexplicable under modern, natural conditions.

**Part 2: Why Ignoring the Distinction is Problematic to the YEC Cause**

**Let's reexamine the first category: Localized Natural Traps.** 

These have occurred throughout history, and are occurring today under very routine circumstances. Gary Haynes studied African Elephants in Zimbabwe and recorded enormous sites of pachyderm death and subsequent partial or total burial around watering holes. This is because African Elephants are quite intelligent, and dig primitive ""wells"" around dried lakes and ponds in pursuit of a drink. Many die as the water is present, but not abundant and creates mud-traps which the elephants cannot escape from. 

There is a similar assemblage in Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota, a dried lake with over 40 mammoth skeletons. 

Taphonomy is taking the former and realizing is is quite relevant to the latter.

Famous proponents of ""Flood Geology"" Whitcomb and Morris took this idea and ran with it in the opposite direction when examining the La Brea Tar Pits, another localized natural trap. 

It does not escape me that many modern proponents of the flood suggest a proto-pachyderm on the ark with mammoths and mastodons proliferating in hyper-evolutionary circumstances afterward. But this is a point being made against the due diligence of the very founders of modern Flood Geology. 

""One might, for example, discuss at length the marvels as the La Brea Pits in Los Angeles, which have yielded tens of thousands of specimens of all kinds of living and extinct animals (each of which by the unbelievable uniformitarian explanation, fell into this sticky graveyard by accident one at a time).""

Morris and Whicomb of course neglect to mention the lack of anything outside the proposed secular assemblage of ecology at the time (no pterosaurs or theropods are in the pits, for example).

And for those proclaiming this is not problematic for the modern ""Flood Geology"" which posits this tar pit is post-flood, well, that's not really going to work either. The specimens are radiometrically dated as 10,000 to 50,000 years old depending on the species (and [radiometric dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) has yet to be proven even slightly incorrect consistently) and the dark color of the bones found in these pits is due to long term soaking by the tar. 

Never mind the tar is gilsonite and crude oil... much of which formed after immense pressure and time from the Carboniferous to now. Proponents of the Flood already skirt Noah's use of tar to waterproof the boat by invoking the idea the Earth was created with the tar already formed. But what then, of La Brea? A Post-Flood Formation?

Localized Natural Traps are decidedly not catastrophic, and thus not a result of the Flood. 

**What about Widespread Regional Accumulations, the second category?**

Well they aren't really helpful to ""Flood Geologists"" either are they, given they reflect the changes across regions, not the world.

Take Solnhofen Germany, a famous fossil site covering 45 by 25 miles and 100-300 feet thick. It consists of fine-grained deposits, and incredibly well preserved organisms (even the ink sacs of squids) as well as toothed birds and the membranous wings of ancient pterosaurs.

So what do we know from the taphonomy? Well, plant life indicates this was an arid area and the fine grain size (1-3 microns) restricts the area to warm and quiet waters so the present lime particles can settle out given their precipitation rate of 1.5 X 10^(15). Preserved trackways of gently moving horseshoes crabs are also present, indicating very little current. But the key is the presence of coccolithiphorid algae remains, suggesting toxicity existed in the bottom layers thanks to algal blooms and subsequent eutrophic conditions. 

None of this is consistent with a global flood. And yet, the flood is invoked for the preservation of those fine feathers and wings, despite the fact that toxic lakes do the same thing to our organisms today. 

The Green River formation is equally problematic. It's assemblages reflect another ecosystem within the secular restraints something Whitcomb and Morris ignore in their book ""Fishing for Fossils"" instead opting to say:

""it is not easy to imagine any kind of ""uniform"" process by which this conglomeration of modern and extinct fishes, birds, reptiles, mammals, insects and plants could have been piled together and preserved for posterity.""

Except... all the forms were freshwater and appropriate for their time. There were no: trilobites, crinoids, mammoths, saltwater fish, dunkleosteans, smilodons, lobsters, dinosaurs or pterosaurs present. 

And so, in come the modern FG's with the idea that this too, is a post flood deposit. 

But... it's 2500 feet thick and 160 miles long by 60 miles wide with marls (fine grained mineral similar to lime). And one has 4000 odd years if working with a 6000 year time scale. With that deposition rate, does this at all sound possible? 

The Morrison formation and Florissant formation present similar issues. 

As is the [Karoo Formation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/azpl4p/the_karoo_formation_and_its_implications_for_the/)

**And that leaves the Truly Catastrophic, but Spatially-Restricted Death Assemblages.**

The problem should be immediately noticeable in the name: these are specially restricted, and invariably tied to local events. 

Take the Belmont Chert near Newcastle Australia. YEC buff Andrew Snelling loves to tout this area as evidence for the Flood, but a closer look (using our taphonomy knowledge) tells a different story. The Chert, 2.5 feet thick, is around 6 miles long by 1 mile wide and it is chock full of insects. Mostly their isolated wings, but enough has been preserved we now have identified 145 species. But there are ash layers, and coal seams present above and below the chert. And the fauna is limited to the insects and some off fish scales, crustaceans and plant debris. This screams local catastrophe, not global flood. 

Or the Ashfall Beds of Nebraska which show an impressive assemblage of Miocene mammals entombed in ash. Curiously, there is nary a trilobite present.

Finally the Lompoc Ditomite Layers which present an enormous death assemblage of pelagic (open water) fish... and enough algae fossils to choke out anything nearby with their algal bloom anoxia. 

Any of the [Global Extinctions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bbdxxz/the_major_extinctions_and_how_they_preclude_a/) will do as well. 

None of these shout to a global flood, but rather, the assemblages are forced into a jigsaw puzzle they simply do not fit to. 

**Part 3: Conclusion and TL;DR**

The Fossil Graveyards so often sourced by Flood supporters are not what they seem. They are rich beds of history whose true obituaries lie in their microfossils, ecologic assembly, death poses, and geology. And there isn't a single Fossil Graveyard, of any kind, that points to a global flood. The reason for this, is it is simply impossible given the number of Graveyards that point to the very opposite: local or regional events. Sometimes those events can snowball into mass extinctions sure, but one flood assembly points to a local flood. To have a Global Flood, well...

All the Graveyards would scream it, from their jumbled and disarticulated fossils to their distinct lack of arid conditions, anoxia or ashfall. 

But that, is simply not what we see.",13,1560495710,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/c0h2tb/fossil_graveyards_how_they_preclude_a_global/
DebateEvolution,byteej,Jattok,,t2_6de87,self.DebateEvolution,,"""Darwin Devolves: Introduction,"" or: How creationists believe any old nonsense that fits their beliefs...","/u/nomenmeum on /r/creation posted his quick review of Michael Behe's *Darwin Devolves*, a book that is scientifically inept with nothing worthwhile for anyone to read except those already in the creationist/ID camp. There's a reason why Behe doesn't write textbooks for the college or high school student; he writes for the crowd he knows will believe his bullshit.


Nomenmeum's review:

&gt; I'm reading Darwin Devolves by Michael Behe, and I thought it would be useful and fun for me to share some of my favorite parts as I go along. I don't intend to do a proper summary of each part, just to highlight what I thought was most interesting or insightful.

&gt; The first part is essentially a brief history of ID, beginning in antiquity. He notes, very rightly, that

&gt; ""all particular positions on the topic can be considered to be elaborations on either of just two general mutually exclusive views:

&gt; (1) contemporary nature, including people, is an accident;

&gt; (2) contemporary nature, especially people, is largely intended—the product of a preexisting reasoning mind.""

&gt; For me the most interesting part follows this. It is a short bio. He heads up this part by recounting a time when he

&gt; ""opened an academic journal called Biology &amp; Philosophy and spotted this sentence: “To see the point quite palpably, note that Stalin, or Osama bin Laden, or Michael Behe, or your favorite villain is also . . .” The man who included me in that rogues gallery was Alexander Rosenberg, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University.""

&gt; Behe's reasons for bringing this up are two-fold:

&gt; One, it is a typical example of the sort of socially sanctioned bullying that he and all proponents of ID are subjected to.

&gt; Two, it is the segue to the story of his journey to ID. What I found most interesting was that, being raised a Catholic, he had at first completely embraced naturalistic abiogenesis and evolution. Only after reading Evolution: A Theory in Crisis by Michael Denton did he realize,

&gt; ""I had never heard any of my teachers critique Darwin's theory in all of my science studies.""

&gt; He goes on to say,

&gt; ""At that point I concluded that I had been led to believe in Darwin’s theory not because of strong evidence for it. Rather, it was for sociological reasons—that simply was the way educated people were expected to think these days. My professors hadn’t been intentionally misleading—that was the framework in which they thought about life too. But from then on I resolved to decide for myself what the evidence showed. When one starts to treat Darwinism as a hypothesis about the biochemical level of life rather than as an assumption, it takes about ten minutes to conclude it’s radically inadequate. It takes perhaps another ten minutes to realize that the molecular foundation of life was designed..."" [Emphasis mine.]

&gt; Bonus: If anyone would like to see Alexander Rosenberg, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy at Duke University taken to the woodshed, I suggest you watch him debate William Lane Craig.

First, the sentence used in the ""short bio"" comes from a philosophy of science journal, which is titled: ""Darwin’s nihilistic idea: evolution and the meaninglessness of life."" The paper discusses Daniel Dennett's use of the theory of evolution to explain how life is nihilistic. This paper was published back in 2002. The Dover trial started in 2005. So he was a giant dickweed even before he flamed out in spectacular style on the stand, apparently.

The entire paragraph of this quote to keep the context clear is:

&gt; &gt; Still owing us a naturalization of value or obligation, Dennett comes to the ﬁnal chapter of Darwin’s Dangerous Idea, where he again invokes his apt account of natural selection using cranes to lift lineages of biological systems and their traits through the subregions of design space to ones where good, better and (locally) best adaptations lie. The trajectory of this path through design space produced, among other things J.S. Bach, who is ""precious not because he had within his brain a magic pearl of genius-stuff, a skyhook, but because he was, or contained, an utterly idiosyncratic structure of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes."" But is it impertinent to ask why the fact that his genius is the result of cranes within cranes within cranes makes it precious? Surely the assertion without argument that its origins in the algorithm of natural selection make Bach’s genius precious to us or precious simpliciter is another instance of the genetic fallacy. To see the point quite palpably, note that Stalin or Osama bin Laden, or Michael Behe, or your favorite villain, is also ""an utterly idiosyncratic structure of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes, made of cranes.""

Out of context, it sounds like Behe is being compared to Osama bin Laden or Stalin, when he's in a list with those folks but is being compared to Bach, asking why Bach's brain at the end of his lineage should be considered precious, but why not bin Laden's, Stalin's, Behe's or a particular villain. In context, it's not as bad as Nomenmeum is making it out to be. And there's no bullying being done here; Behe is just a dishonest fuckup.

Then this argument:

&gt; ""I had never heard any of my teachers critique Darwin's theory in all of my science studies.""

Yeah, no shit. Teachers are there to explain the science and how a student can understand how we know what we know. Decent science educators don't waste valuable class time saying how wrong what they're teaching is (unless they're forced to teach nonsense because a school board or legislature has dictated nonsense be taught in a classroom). But evolution is not nonsense. So why would any decent teacher be knocking it in their lectures?

While we're at it, I've never heard any of my chemistry teachers criticize atomic theory in classes, therefore, I'm going to start believing in deistic-stickiness.

See how absurd that is? That's how fucking stupid creationists are, that this argument works for them when it leads people toward their belief system.

&gt; ""At that point I concluded that I had been led to believe in Darwin’s theory not because of strong evidence for it....""

Because Behe obviously didn't pay attention in his classes, or he's lying. There's no other explanation for this utter dishonesty. He's trying to sell books to gullible folks, so my money is on lying.

What are your thoughts?

[nomenmeum's take on design arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bw2ia1/summary_of_findings_about_evolutionists_and_their/eq1flz2/)

&gt; Whoever claims that a creature is poorly designed is admitting that they believe there is a better design,

&gt; ...which is to say that there is a design that could achieve the creature's purpose more effectively.

&gt; ...which is to say the creature has a purpose,

&gt; ...which is to say it has a designer.

&gt; Accidents don't have purpose or function, and yet all biologists are forced, whether they like it or not, to speak in terms of purpose and function when it comes to living systems.

As you can see, the argument settles down to, admit that there is design, therefore designer, or admit that there is a better design, therefore purpose, therefore designer.

Creationists refuse to do any of the work to support their ideas and present anything resembling science. All they have are logical fallacies and dishonest tactics to try to make their side have equal footing, or the win, in these discussions.

But the moment that you try to ask any of them about evidence for a designer existing, they run back to the same arguments that they used for design, then declare, ""There must be a designer!""

It's just pointless. Creationists know they're wrong and don't care. Creationists know that they can't defend their arguments without fallacies and lies and don't care. They know that they're not trying to convince the other person that they're right but trying to show others that their ideas have merit since they got to ""debate.""

No creationist deserves a debate about scientific topics. Pointing out that creationists are wrong about science when they make bad claims isn't debating them, but making it clear what their errors are.

If creationists feel that this is wrong, the entire scientific community is waiting for your answer to this:

What experiment, with control, can be setup to test the existence of the designer/creator, and what results should we expect from the experiment?

If you can't answer this, then start being honest and admit that the notion of a creator/designer in nature is 100% wrong.",45,1559927600,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bxx5mc/why_there_is_no_debate_to_be_had_between_rational/

*Furthermore, 97% of your DNA is commented out. DNA is linear and read from start to end. The parts that should not be decoded are marked very clearly, much like C comments. The 3% that is used directly form the so called 'exons'. The comments, that come 'inbetween' are called 'introns'.*  


*These comments are fascinating in their own right. Like C comments they have a start marker, like /\*, and a stop marker, like \*/. But they have some more structure. Remember that DNA is like a tape - the comments need to be snipped out physically! The start of a comment is almost always indicated by the letters 'GT', which thus corresponds to /\*, the end is signalled by 'AG', which is then like \*/.*

DebateEvolution,bw2hrb,MRH2,,t2_8y18w,self.DebateEvolution,,Summary of responses to evolution and bad design,"A week ago I posted some questions on /r/debateEvolution to try and understand what’s going on with the idea of “bad design”.  It turns out that there is a wide spectrum of opinion among evolutionists.

* Evolutionists is a short form for people, many of whom are atheists, who believe that evolution explains how life came to be the way we see it now, the origin of species and all that. It’s not meant to be pejorative.


[The questions are here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bt840r/confusion_about_evolution_and_bad_design/), abbreviated below: 

1. Does evolution automatically include the idea that nature is badly designed? Is the idea that nature is badly designed an intrinsic part of evolutionary theory? 
2. If you say that something in nature is badly designed, then one would expect that you could also detect the opposite. As someone who believes in evolution, is it possible to see things that are well designed as well as things that are badly designed? If not, why not?
3. Is everything in nature badly designed?
4. If not, can you give some examples of things in nature that we well designed?
5. If someone answers the above question and states some features of nature that are well designed, does this then mean that they are a creationist or does this mean that evolution is false? Do other evolution advocates see them as a traitor to evolution if they say that something is well designed?
6. Biomimetics is the field of engineering where we copy designs from nature to improve our products. If nature only has bad designs why would we be copying them? How do we improve our products by adding bad design to them?


## First of all, some universals:

We should all note that creationists have really poisoned the well on this one. A very common response is to have a knee-jerk reaction against the word “design”. Examples: 

*  Creationists don't usually debate in good faith and love to sneak in terminology in other descriptions
* Saying something is ""designed"" you are sneaking in a ""designer"" because design naturally requires a designer the same way a painting requires a painter, and that's why people are arguing with you.
* The term “design” is best avoided because it’s misleading; it suggests the existence of a designer that we don’t postulate.

Obviously, evolution does not believe in a designer. Hopefully we are all aware of that basic fact. However, I think that there is still reason enough to use word “design” and that, hopefully, we’ve progressed past the juvenile stage of “Hey, you said ‘design’, you must believe in God. Gotcha.”  If an ID-proponent wants to use this sort of argument, from ‘design’ to ‘designer’ then they should be up-front about what they are doing and how they are arguing.

Another universal: all the groups seemed to agree that if one of their colleagues used the word “design” when referring to nature, then that doesn’t automatically mean that they have abandoned evolution. This is a good and sensible response – even from the group who would not be caught dead using the d-word themselves.

## Here are the different groups, different viewpoints, that I’ve seen in the responses.

**Group 1.** There are a lot of evolutionists for whom the word “design” is a red flag and they absolutely will not use it because (for some people) it necessarily implies a designer. Thus, discussing whether a fingernail is well-designed or not is like asking if a fingernail is kyenwwmgo or quenglanckly.  

Dialogue? Any discussion about it is useless. But this is not a problem if someone in this group clearly states their position so no one is wasting time debating things that don’t exist.  Note that the person discussing with them has to be able to actually listen as well, in order to understand that this is the position of the evolutionist.

Logical contradictions: (i) none at all. Unless (ii) they are part of the group that argues that things are badly designed. Group 1 cannot say that anything is badly designed because they don’t believe in design and won’t use that word.

**Group 1b.** This group might be the same as the first. This group doesn’t believe in design, or in ever using the word design, but does not clearly state their position and actually tries to argue about design.  This ends up with a very confusing discussion with neither side able to understand the other. This seems to be the group that claims to not understand my questions (though they are straightforward), and when I reply to things, say that I obviously didn’t understand anyone’s responses. It’s very frustrating and reminds me of when a Hindu devotee was trying to explain Hinduism to me. I understood all of the words, but the sentences and the ideas made no sense to me. 

Dialogue? It’s a total waste of time discussion design with this group as no one will get anywhere.

Logical contradictions: If you don’t believe that ‘design’ can be used in a sentence referring to nature, then don’t argue about design. If you have some non-standard redefinition of ‘design’ so that you can use it when referring to nature, then you better make sure that whoever you are talking with understands this and can follow what you’re saying. It’s better to chose a word that reflects what you mean rather than redefining existing words.

**Group 2.** There are evolutionists who are able to discuss design in nature. This group is able to make the mental translation from “bad design” to “if this were a product of design, then it was done badly.” I’m not sure what the translation of “good design” would be.

**Group 2a** Their take is that there is no design in nature. No good designs, no bad designs.  (I’m not really sure if this should be group 2a or is just another facet of group 1.)

Dialogue? There doesn’t seem to be any point discussing design with them.

Logical contradictions: trying to talk about bad design when there are no designs in nature.

** Group 2b**. There are a LOT of evolutionists who talk quite vehemently about bad designs.  They seem to be able to use “design” in discussion and in making their points. However, they believe that everything is badly designed. There are no good designs in nature. Evolution automatically implies bad design. 

Dialogue? Since this seems to be a philosophical belief, it won’t be changed by any discussion or argument. Talking with these people is totally useless because they won’t acknowledge any points that don’t agree with their foundational a priori belief. You can’t change someone’s inherent belief by arguing with them.

Logical contradictions: (i) not being able to define bad design clearly (e.g. a bat flies but doesn’t have feathers, ergo, it’s a bad design. We only have one opposable thumb on our hand, two would be better, ergo, bad design). (ii) How can something be defined as bad if there is no good to compare it to? (iii) Biomimetics (question 6).


**Group 2c.** There is a group of evolutionists who can talk about design and also who do not believe that evolution automatically implies bad design. Yay! They will say that some things in nature are well designed and some are badly designed. They are able to look at design from an impersonal, detached viewpoint. They don’t feel the need to automatically start discussing the characteristics of the purported designer or bring metaphysics and religion into the discussion. Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed that they’ve given many actual examples of good design in nature, DNA and tardigrades are two that I’ve heard in these discussions.

Dialogue?  Great. This is the group that I would want to discuss design with.

DebateEvolution,buql1o,Volusia25,,t2_126yd9,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution and inherited disorders,"Probably a dumb question. But evolution is just survival of the fittest due to random mutations in alleles.   
E.g. they say Chinese ancestors lived in harsh, snowy conditions, causing them to squint all the time to prevent slow blindness. Ones who didn't went blind and died due to predators or lost their way etc. Those born with naturally slightly narrower eyes could prevent blindness, so over generations these random changes were passed down due to natural selection.  


Well the same should go for any inherited disease. Why do we still have people born with serious things like Type 1 diabetes or cystic fibrosis? Their ancestors would not have lived long, and so were less likely to reproduce and should have been killed of.  
Same with other things like people born with very bad eyesight. How did the ancestors live and breed, when they were almost blind and would be easy prey?  
A lot of conditions weren't even treatable until the past couple hundred years, so how could such a burden genetically survive and reproduce? Its survival of the fittest after all.

DebateEvolution,bu4h6t,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"No, Error Catastrophe Has Never Been Demonstrated Experimentally","Once again, r/creation is claiming that error catastrophe (genetic entropy to Sanford) [is a thing that has been observed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bs0mh1/a_debate_request_between_david_berlinksi_and/eosteff/), namechecking me where I can’t respond. 

So here’s my response. 

Before we get to the specific cases, I need to define a few terms. 

Error catastrophe: Harmful mutations accumulating within a population over generations, causing a net fitness decline below the level of replacement, ultimately resulting in extinction. 

Lethal mutagenesis: Inducing mutations in a population, resulting in extinction. 

Error catastrophe is a subset of lethal mutagenesis. In other words, error catastrophe is always lethal mutagenesis, but lethal mutagenesis doesn’t have to be error catastrophe. 

I also want to say that it’s crystal clear that error catastrophe has never been seen in natural populations, and while I think it *may* be possible that it can be induced experimentally, I’m becoming more skeptical the more I read and play around with the numbers, and I’m *certain* it has never been experimentally demonstrated. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s look at the supposed examples of error catastrophe in [this post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/bs0mh1/a_debate_request_between_david_berlinksi_and/eosteff/) and see why none of them are actual experimental demonstrations of error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

1) Crotty 01 – This is always the go-to, but it ignores the [later work](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483) by the same research group that documented at least five effects of ribavirin, none of which were controlled for in this study. So this work cannot be used to say ribavirin was used to induce error catastrophe; they’d have to repeat the work while controlling for these other effects. 

&amp;nbsp;

2) Loeb 99 – This is a really interesting one. The authors show that serial passaging of HIV in the presence of a chemical mutagen can cause extinction, but they’re very careful to use he term “lethal mutagenesis” rather than “error catastrophe” to describe their findings, because they didn’t demonstrate a correlation between mutation accumulation over generations and fitness. So while error catastrophe may have occurred here, the authors did not actually demonstrate that this was the case. 

&amp;nbsp;

3) Sierra 00 – This study shows a decrease in fitness during mutagenic treatment of a virus and occasional extinction, but the authors point out that small population size (i.e. genetic drift) also contributed to extinction – they only observed extinction when the treated population were diluted, i.e. when the researchers artificially reduced their size. 

&amp;nbsp;

4) Severson 03 – Uses ribavirin, does not control for the other mechanisms of activity. So while this may be error catastrophe, we can’t draw that conclusion without better-controlled follow-up work. 

&amp;nbsp;

5) Fijalkowska 96 – Shows that E. coli require the proofreading subunit of their primary DNC polymerase, and the authors suggest, but do not demonstrate, that inviability without the subunit is due to mutation accumulation. A reasonable hypothesis, but they do not support it with the data in this paper. 

&amp;nbsp;

6) Contreras 02 – This just shows that ribavirin is mutagenic in HCV. They discuss the *possibility* of error catastrophe, but didn’t document it.  

&amp;nbsp;

7) Crotty 00 – This is just shows that ribavirin in an RNA mutagen. This same team said in source number 1 above that error catastrophe had not yet been demonstrated, which means the people that wrote this paper say it doesn’t demonstrate error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

8) de la Torre 05 – This is lethal mutagenesis but not error catastrophe. Figure 2 shows this pretty clearly. To clearly demonstrate error catastrophe, they’d have to do measure burst time before treatment, then sample between *each* burst and demonstrate a decline over generations. The data right now don’t show that. 

&amp;nbsp;

9) Ahluwalia 13 – Doesn’t show a decrease in fitness, just an increase in mutations. The authors are using the term “error catastrophe” to describe something that is very much not error catastrophe. 

&amp;nbsp;

10) Day 05 – Uses ribavirin, doesn’t control for the many activities of ribavirin. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, I’m not saying error catastrophe can never happen. I’m saying it has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Each of these papers has a deficiency, in what was measured, in the experimental controls, or just plain being not relevant to the question, that makes it not a demonstration of error catastrophe.",255,1559072405,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bu4h6t/no_error_catastrophe_has_never_been_demonstrated/
DebateEvolution,btot5o,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Coral and Coral Reefs Preclude a Global Flood and Young Earth Creationism,"Today's subject is that of the one of the most basal organisms on our planet, and it is capable on it's own of disrupting the possibility of a global flood as well as a 6000 year old Earth. It also validates Evolutionary Theory and the currently listed mass extinctions. 

It may be a simple cnidarian, but we'll explore just how damaging this animal is to a literalist interpretation of the Bible. 

**Part 1: The Crash Course on Corals**

Corals are marine invertebrates of the phylum Cnidaria. They are sessile, meaning they lack a means of locomotion, and individual corals (polyps) form coral groups known as colonies, whose polyps are thus genetically identical. They reproduce primarily sexually though, and coral colonies will release gametes into open water simultaneously according to the lunar cycle. 

As such, coral reefs are made of many coral colonies which many vary on species, but all of which grow upwards and outwards asexually. In the case of stony coral (as opposed to the other type, soft coral) their immense skeleton is made of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite (both polymorphs of limestone).

Coral reefs are interesting though, due to their nature of growth. As coral reefs proliferate, coral groups die and are replaced by new polyps. This leads to a continuous growth of new coral colonies on the dead skeletons of their colonial fore-bearers. 

In fact, the largest reefs on our planet are living coral groups on thousands of years of dead coral groups including the Great Barrier Reef. 

The coral type we are going to investigate here is that of large stony corals (scleractinian) which build  shallow-water coral reefs, including fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; the majority of which occur in tropical and subtropical seas. This is because these particular corals are not only incredibly common, but they are of interest thanks to their abysmally slow growth rate adding an [average of 0.2-1.0 inches per year to the overall height of the reef.](https://coral.org/coral-reefs-101/coral-reef-ecology/how-coral-reefs-grow/) 

According to this same source corals have ideal growing conditions that apply generally across the board: "" Coral reefs grow best in warm water (70–85° F or 21–29° C). Corals prefer clear and shallow water, where lots of sunlight filters through to their symbiotic algae. It is possible to find corals at depths of up to 300 feet (91 meters), but reef-building corals grow poorly below 60–90 feet (18–27 meters). Corals need salt water to survive, so they grow poorly near river openings or coastal areas with excessive runoff.""

All of the following will be important to remember and refer to for the following analysis. 

**Part 2: A History of Corals**

Geologically, we first see corals appear in Cambrian rock, although their record really begins to bloom in the Ordovician. Here we see the rise of the incredibly prolific [Rugose Corals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugosa).

They are represented heavily in the Thorton Reef  in Illinois at the Silurian Racine Formation, where ancient reef cavities are filled with thick oil, and layering is interspersed. The Devonian Tract in Alberta is similar. 

These corals no longer exist today, as they were wiped out in the Permian, leaving an enormous void in the fossil record. But shortly after in the Triassic the scleractinian corals arrive on the scene, and become the dominant corals we see today. 

This is important: Prior to the extinction of the Rugose corals, we *never* see a scleractinian specimen in the fossil record. It isn't until the rugose niche opens up that the scleractinians can diversify into their spots. This is **not** to say that scleractians did not exist before the Triassic, but rather, they were represented by much fewer species due to competition with the rugose corals. In fact, current [molecular data](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-316) suggests that scleractinians were out and about deep in the Paleozoic, but their radiation was choked by the sheer success of the rugose species. 

The shoe would be on the other foot though, as the anoxic conditions that obliterated the rugose corals could not squelch the scleractinians, who had been quietly subsisting in the background. They would explode in diversity in the Mid-Triassic once a symbiotic relationship with algae was developed. 

**Part 3: Corals Confound Creationists**

So hopefully you're already seeing the problems, but let's point them out and dive in a bit more. 

 **Rugose Coral Reefs bust up a Global Flood AND a Young Earth**

Flood Geology generally has the first layer of the flood deposits as that which overlays the basement granite of our planet, or layers corresponding to the Pre-Cambrian. In the context of the Grand Canyon, this would be the Grand Canyon Supergroup as the first. 

Now, as we mentioned above, Thorton Reef is a Silurian Reef, and the Silurian begins some 443 MYA. This is certainly smack-dab in the middle of the Flood Layers. 

Thorton Reef is a remarkably intact reef, with incredibly preserved brittle coral heads, crinoid fossils and other fragile organisms. But it is located in a layer that would have been deposited in the *very heat* of what is considered by Creationists as the most powerful natural disaster of all time. 

But somehow we are expected to accept an enormous global flood that instantly buried some organisms, and tore other apart (depending on the state of the fossil examined), *raged for months* without burying an enormous reef, and then, midway through, covered it instantly without it's earthshaking power obliterating all the fragile bits. 

The Rugose corals too are slow growers and make up an enormous tract of land in the [Devonian formation in Alberta](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249890738_Tectonic_Control_of_Devonian_Reef_Sedimentation_Alberta_ABSTRACT): ""...the Upper Devonian Swan Hills Formation of the Beaverhill Lake Group. Kaybob reef is a flat north-south elongate lens, 250 ft thick, 11 mi long, and 3 mi wide, built on the Slave Point Formation, a widespread platform carbonate.""

It is far too large to have formed in less than 3000 years from Creation to the Flood, even using the most liberal Creation date by YEC's of 10,000 years. 

Add to this the trouble of the flood wiping out all corals, due to their requirements clear shallow water and low turbidity (rugose corals are shown to require these as well, given the shaping of the Thornton Reef) and all current reefs then having a maximum age of 4319 years (presuming the flood was in 2300 BCE)

**And Modern Corals do the Same.**

Take the [Enewetok atoll.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enewetak_Atoll) This atoll was [cored](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0260y/report.pdf) many decades ago, and indicated that it is an enormous coral reef growing on volcanic rock. As the volcanic rock sunk (as some do) the coral was forced to grow upwards in order to maintain proper  conditions. This is  similar to how trees grow towards sunlight. And it created a massive slab of coral around 1380 meters thick, nearly a mile. The deepest parts were so old, that the aragonite skeletons of the coral were geochemically converted to dolomite. 

Let's give Creationists the best possible scenario and assume all these corals are growing at the fastest known coral growth rate of 8 inches per year. To be clear, we know that these corals abide by the far more common growth rate of 0.1-1.0 inches per year, but we're being generous. 

A depth of 4540.8 feet X 12 inches / 8 inches per year yields an age of 6811.2 years. nearly 3000 years too old to have begun growing before the flood, and using the most generous possible growth rate, applied to corals who definitively do not grow that quickly. 

The more realistic math using these species actual growth rates gives the atoll a minimum age of 138,000 years old, and that is still eliminating any erosional events in the core sample.

Coral Reefs line Enewetok or the Great Barrier Reef are ignored though, or spun to fit the narrative as in [this link](https://www.oldearth.org/rebuttal/magazines/Creation/1985/article_v8_i1_great_barrier_reef.htm), where Old Earth Ministries busts YEC authors Snelling and Reed for misrepresentation, or, dishonesty. 

Sometimes in an effort to explain this, Creationists invoke that the ancient coral colonies such as Thorton did not grow in one place, but are a result of many colonies that grew in separate places and were transported to a new location by the current, and subsequently buried. 

Of course this brings us right back around to the problem of the fragile corals and other organisms, as well as the orientation of the reef itself. If it were carried by strong currents and placed elsewhere it should be heavy-side-down. But the heavy part of the reef, the enormous upward growth, is facing upward as it would if it had never been moved. 

And so, Creationists are left with either invoking coral growth faster than ever before seen (which is not empirical) or suggesting physics defying currents, which have also never been seen. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

Corals are incredible animals whose appearance, diversification and persistence in the fossil record aligns not with sudden Creation but with Evolutionary Theory given the succession of Rugose corals by Scleractinians. Additionally, their growth rates even at their most generous preclude the traditional YEC timeline both in modern reefs and ancient reefs. This leaves Creationists dealing with the coral issue by ignoring it or invoking never-before-seen physics and biologic concepts.",21,1558978456,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/btot5o/coral_and_coral_reefs_preclude_a_global_flood_and/
DebateEvolution,bt840r,MRH2,,t2_8y18w,self.DebateEvolution,,Confusion about evolution and bad design,"I'm confused about evolution and bad design

I'm not sure that I'm really understanding how evolution and bad design are connected. There have been some vehement conversations about bad design and I don't understand why this is happening, so I have some questions so that I can understand the evolutionary viewpoint better:

Does evolution automatically include the idea that nature is badly designed? (By nature, I mean things like breathing, toe nails, teeth, scales, organs, organisms, ...) Is the idea that nature is badly designed an intrinsic part of evolutionary theory?

If you say that something in nature is badly designed, then one would expect that you could also detect the opposite, something ""not-bad"". As someone who believes in evolution, is it possible to see things that are well designed as well as things that are badly designed? If not, why not? 

Is everything in nature badly designed? 

If not, can you give some examples of things in nature that we well designed?

If someone answers the above question and states some features of nature that are well designed, does this then mean that they are a creationist or does this mean that evolution is false? Do other evolution advocates see them as a traitor to evolution if they say that something is well designed?

Biomimetics is the field of engineering where we copy designs from nature to improve our products. If nature only has bad designs why would we be copying them? How do we improve our products by adding bad design to them? (Examples of biomimetics: velcro, lotus-inspired hydrophobic surfaces, fog-harvesting from beetles, sharkshin surfaces to reduce drag and fouling in hulls, dry adhesion by gecko toe pads.)  _I know that people can detect bad design because there's a whole subreddit about it: /r/crappydesign  QED ;)_

I'm asking these questions because of baffling posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/atnjse/what_would_intelligent_design_actually_look_like/eh2foue/). He bascially says that any concession that something in nature is designed means that you are admitting the God exists and is the designer. I don't see this at all. I don't follow that ""logic"". I don't assume that you have abandoned atheistic evolution if you say that something is well designed (hopefully this will be discussed in the question about traitors above). From what I can see, working through the questions above should lead one to be able to state that there are some parts of nature that we well designed (e.g. photosynthesis or DNA or something).  So what does everyone else here think? Do all you scientists who have spent decades studying biology and evolution think like /u/cubist137 or do you see that some things in nature are well designed?  I'd like a little clarity.

_P.S. Just in case you can't follow my reasoning, I am most emphatically not arguing that everything in nature is well designed (ingrown toenails and varicose veins are a huge pain). I am also most definitely not arguing that God exists, that God is the designer or any sort of other crazy stuff. I am not arguing that feature X is well designed either._",77,1558878544,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bt840r/confusion_about_evolution_and_bad_design/

You've likely seen the ones involving:

 The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics: ""Evolution violates the *fact* that everything proceeds towards entropy."" A false argument, as it ignores the nature of Earth as an open system. 

Abiogenesis: ""Evolution has problems from the get go, no one has proven abiogenesis can happen."" The two are entirely different fields, and this statement shows a classic lack of understanding of *what evolution even is:* Change in allele frequencies in populations over time.

And another classic: Transitional species do not exist, or if they do, there are not enough of them. 

The latter is the focus of this post: Many Creationists lack an understanding of the nature of taphonomy, fossilization and life assemblages, which is essential for interpreting transitional forms. Many expect stepwise representation of literal lineages, and worse, they fervently presume this is what evolutionary theory predicts we should find. 

It is at this point you might grow frustrated, as someone who has looked into this even remotely understands this is the antithesis of the predictions evolutionary theory, taphhonomy and paleontology make. And yet it is proposed as a strawman to take down in order to make the fields appear unsteady. 

Enter a lovely blog by a Theistic Evolutionist aiming to clear the air. [Letter to Creationists](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/) is written by Dr. Buchanan, an individual with some interesting education and experience:

""B.A. in Near Eastern Studies, a year at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and a year working as a plumber and a lab technician. Then a B.S.E.  and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering. Since then, have conducted research in an industrial laboratory. Published a number of papers on heterogeneous catalysis, and am an inventor on over 100 U.S. patents in diverse technical areas."" 

And they've written [This](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/realistic-expectations-for-transitional-fossils/) article titled ""Realistic Expectations for Transitional Fossils"" an excellent piece that lays out a couple of things: 

**The Key Factors Governing the Fossil Record**

**Expectations for Fossil Lineages**

**Do Transitionals Prove Evolution?**

**Skepticism**

**YEC Underlying Problems**

He gets into quite a bit of Theology, but the purposes of this post are to analyze what the professionals actually expect of transitionals versus the what Creationists put forward as what is expected. Because as we will see they are quite different.  Only some of the above will be covered here so I recommend you read the article. 

**Part 1: Creationists versus Everyone Else** 

It is well known by the general public that conventional science says we have an absolute myriad of transitional forms. Creationists (YEC and OEC alike) disagree, obviously. And in a conversation with one or many, you might go through what is a very similar path as the Narcissist's Prayer: 

 **""Transitional Fossils do not exist.** 

**And if they do, there's no way of showing the species are related morphologically.** 

**And if there is, there's no way evolution can occur that quickly.** 

**And if it can, here's a fossil for your particular lineage that's problematic.**

 **And if it's not, Scientists are biased.""**

This usually comes from people who lack an education in any of the fields involved (biology, paleontology, taphonomy, geology etc) who for some unknown reason thinks that their idea of Common Sense trumps the education and experience of *thousands* of scientists through the years. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it comes from someone who does have some training, and it is there that we find many of the scientists working for the YEC websites such as AiG or ICR. 

Those in the second grouping are certainly convicted. But the strange bit is you will rarely find a Creationist Paleontologist. In fact, I don't even know of a single one. This is because when a religious person is educated, they *tend* to abandon their faith, or adapt it. Mary Schwietzer and Jack Horner are both fervent Christians who are Theistic Evolutionists, for example. 

Essentially we have a scenario where the overwhelming majority of scientists (and according to [polling](https://news.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx), Americans in general) [accept Evolution](https://rightingamerica.net/the-evolution-of-creationism-in-american-higher-education-part-1/) and the Antiquity of the Earth, and they are challenged by a comparatively small fringe-group with a much poorer showing of college graduates (highest percentage of Creationists is in the bible belt, lowest consistent [advanced degree acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment) is there as well).

And here is where we see an objective example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect: People who know less comparatively, think they know more. These groups assert they see common sense truths where people who have spent their entire lives training and working in the fields of evolutionary biology simple do not. 

And this, is problematic. It is the reason for the strange mantra about transitional fossils listed above. So how can things be cleared up? By talking about it. Challenge ideas and let your ideas be challenged, and most importantly one cannot fear the truth. 

Let's look at the truth regarding transitionals.

**Part 2: The Truth about Transitionals**

In science in general, the evidence makes or breaks the hypothesis. As such, the evidence *must always* support the conclusion, or theory/law, by definition. 

As such, ""transitional fossils are a significant part of the evidence for or against evolution. It is necessary to have a correct understanding of the nature of transitional fossils, in order to properly evaluate the physical evidence. ""

So Dr. Buchanan lays out the key factors that must be considered:

 

 **(1) The fossil record is inherently very sparse.** Very, very few of all the organisms that have died in past eons become fossilized.  As we can observe today, nearly all carcasses rot or are eaten by scavengers rather than being buried intact in rock layers. Of the remains that do get fossilized, many are later eroded away if the rocks in which they are embedded are raised above sea level.  If these rocks become deeply buried, the fossils can become smeared beyond recognition in metamorphic transformations. This is even more of an issue for older rock layers, such as the Paleozoic era (Cambrian through Permian periods), since they have had more time to be either raised up to the surface for erosion or to be buried more deeply.  Also, of all the potential fossil-bearing rocks, only a small fraction is available in surface exposures for paleontologists to examine.

As [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_record%20) points out, “The number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.”    No fossils have yet been found for about a third of the 30+ phyla of living animals.  Occasionally (e.g. once every 15 million years or so) we find a rock formation such as the Burgess Shale where conditions were just right to preserve a rich assemblage of fossils (including many soft-bodied animals) in that locale at that snapshot in time.  These “Lagerstatte” are the exceptions which prove the rule: they confirm that the ancient seas were teeming with diverse life-forms, but in most times and in most places (i.e. apart from these very rare fossil-rich formations), these organisms simply did not become preserved as recognizable fossils.

The Coelacanth order of fishes furnishes a classic example of the fickleness of the fossil record. These fish were once widespread in the ancient seas. Coelacanths peaked in the fossil record about 240 million years ago, and then declined. The most recent known fossil dates back to about 80 million years ago. It was thought that they had become extinct. In 1938, however, a live coelacanth was discovered in the Indian Ocean. Since then a number of others have been caught.  Unless we are prepared to claim that an Intelligent Agent supernaturally re-created these modern coelacanths, *we must acknowledge that some population of these fish has existed for the past 80 million years but* *without leaving a trace in the fossil record.* 

We should expect to observe many gaps like this in the fossil record.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_taxon) is a list of other “Lazarus taxa” which disappear from the fossil record for millions of years, but appear again later.

**(2) New species tend to develop in small, isolated populations**. The arithmetic of basic population genetics shows that it is more difficult for new genetic mutations to become established in very large populations, than in small populations. This is readily confirmed by laboratory studies. For instance, [Perfeito et al](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5839/813.short). found that new beneficial mutations were much more readily established in small populations of bacteria than in large populations.

Thus, it is far more likely that a new species would develop within a small, isolated population, especially if that population is under some environmental stress that would favor genetic changes. The odds of us finding fossils from that small, localized population is are nearly zero.  If the new species becomes more fit than the old species, the new species will expand, and only then is likely to appear in the fossil record. But once a species is widespread and successful in its ecological niche, there will be diminished selection pressure for changes, so fossils of this now well-adapted species are likely to appear for perhaps million of years with showing little change.

**(3) A given population can persist for many millions of years with little morphological change.**  As demonstrated by the longevity of the coelacanth group, a specific type of organism can persist for tens of millions of years with only modest changes.  Thus, if we find a fossil of some species in rocks dated as being, say, 100 million years old, it is quite possible that a similar, related species (same genus or family) also existed 110 million years ago, and maybe even 150 million years ago, whether or not we have found these older fossils yet.  For instance, the past 80 million years would constitute such a “ghost” lineage for coelacanths.

 **(4) Evolutionary lineages tend to be “branchy”.**  Typically what shows up in the fossil record are organisms on the side branches, rather than the directly ancestral ones along the main “trunk” of the family tree. These side branch species often show intermediate features, but are not the actual transitional fossils.""

And so, it is important to remember the bushy nature of life, taphonomy and fossilization. Even though we have what appears to be a concise and stepwise transition of forms, general forms can persist past their progeny's emergence and forms are likely not truly direct, but rather depict a gradient of traits appearing and overall evolutionary trends.

**Because that is the key part so many creationists miss out on: a primary use of transitionals rests on their ability to track the emergence and persistence of varying  morphologic traits through geologic time.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: The Truth about Lineages** 

Dr. Buchanon lays out the major differences in what Creationists expect from the fossil record, versus what the actual science has *always* expected. 

""Figure 1 represents a naïve expectation of what the fossil record should look like for the evolutionary family tree encompassing some species **A** through **D**. In this figure, there is a single lineage, with the direct ancestors all appearing as fossils.  Each earlier form neatly disappears from the fossil record as the next one appears, so there are no overlaps. From the four factors discussed above, it is obvious why Figure 1 is not realistic, yet this is what YE creationists often demand to see.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ddhqn8oqzny21)

 Figure 2 shows a more realistic fossil lineage. The points of actual divergence (common ancestors) are relatively unlikely to have left fossils. It is more probable that we will find fossils of successful populations on the side branches of the family tree, such as **B** and **C** in this figure. This is not due to some weakness in evolution. Rather it is due to the intrinsic nature of speciation and fossil preservation (branching, new species arising in small populations, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](bcbt5jpvzny21)

 Figure 3 below better represents the type of fossil pattern we expect from what is known about speciation and fossilization: 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](to71u3450oy21)

 

A possible family tree for these fossils is shown above in Figure 4. The thick lines denote the observed fossils, with the thin lines denoting inferred lineage relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](iszsjema0oy21)

 The little changes from one species to the next are not accessible, and direct lineal ancestors are typically not found. However, for a typical major transition a range of “cousin” fossils are found which manifest key intermediate characteristics, in the appropriate time range for that transition. For most objective observers, this constitutes strong supporting evidence for evolution.  It certainly shows that the fossil record is not a “problem” for evolution. ""

And this above, is the crux of it. 

**Part 4: These Expectations Have Never Been Different**

So often ""Origin"" is the only science held to impossible standards by Creationists. They do not ask the same of other branches. And occasionally it is proposed that because evolutionary theory changes to accommodate new evidence (you know, as all science should) it is wrong. Mind you, the core proponents have never changed: Allele frequencies change in populations through time. Full stop. 

But yes, sometimes aspects of the science do change. However, Darwin said his peace on transitionals in the very beginning, proving just how warped ""our expectations of these fossil lineages"" presented by Creationists are: 

 ""*As the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations,* ***we ought not to expect to find****, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two formations,* ***all the intermediate varieties between the species*** *which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods:* ***but we ought to find*** ***after intervals, very long as measured by years****, but only moderately long as measured geologically,* ***closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these assuredly we do find****.* ***We find****, in short,* ***such evidence*** *of the slow and scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms,* ***as we have the right to expect.""***

And Buchanan then notes "" The fossil record is clearly compatible with evolution. Indeed, the same can be said for all physical observations, in geology, biology, chemistry, and genetics. The hard reality, though, is that a dedicated YE creationist will not be convinced of macroevolution by any physical evidence. *No matter how many fossil intermediates he is presented with, he will always find a way to wiggle out.*  He can say, “Yes, there is a sequence of fossils with gradually varying characteristics, but you can’t *prove* that one evolved into the next; you are just assuming evolutionary relationships among them.” Or, “How do you know that God did not miraculously create these species in this sequence?” 

You can lead an eohippus to water, but you can't make him drink.

**Part 5: Conclusions and TL;DR**

Dr. Buchanan finishes his post by noting that a primary driver of the Creationist movement to buck Evolutionary Theory is rooted in a deep desire to obliterate materialism. He has this to say on the impossible nature of that goal:

"" Every human alive today was conceived and grown by strictly materialistic processes. We can watch sperms fertilize eggs and see the egg cells divide; we can in large measure track the biochemical processes behind all this. The growth of neuronal networks in the fetal brain unfolds without supernatural invention. Every mental event corresponds to some array of physical events in the brain, which in turn are subject to the usual laws of physics. These are the key facts that anti-materialists have to deal with.

Whether or not scientists are able to explain every twist and turn of evolution does not touch these currently-observed facts. Thus, ID’s campaign of sowing doubt about evolution cannot possibly accomplish its avowed goal of unseating materialistic philosophies.""

I think there is something to this. The version of God Dr. Buchanan sees in Creationism is too small. He is bound by the human interpretation of a book He is supposed to have written. He notes that the loss of faith experienced by enormously growing numbers of young adults today is due to the ride-or-die attitude some Creationists preach to them: that they must accept the bible entirely literally and reject any aspect of nature that disagrees, or they aren't truly Christian. 

Add to this the glaring lack of even a basic understanding of Evolutionary Theory that is so prevalent on popular YEC websites and it becomes clear that one of the major reasons why people don't accept evolutionary theory is simply because they aren't taught *what it is and what we expect.* After all, it's quite easy to disprove the other side when you make their arguments for them.

Hopefully this post has helped illuminate the actual expectations conventional science has of transitional forms.

TL;DR: Transitional fossils are characterized by a vast variety of factors which are often overlooked or unknown to Creationists entirely. These factors must be understood to properly understand why transitional fossils absolutely concur with Evolutionary Theory, and when they are ignored the result is a conversation based in non-conventional science that is not viable in any practical aspect of the field.",7,1558054005,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bpkl6p/realistic_expectations_for_transitional_fossils_a/
DebateEvolution,bpa5rz,Jonathandavid77,Accepts evolution,t2_15ml7b4i,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationism as a paradigm in crisis,"If we look at creationism as an a priori potentially valid scientific paradigm, we can study it from the context of Thomas Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*. One quote from that book that seems particularly relevant is this, from chapter VIII, *The Response to Crisis*:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When...an anomaly comes to seem more than just another puzzle of normal science, the transition to crisis and to extraordinary science has begun. The anomaly itself now comes to be more generally recognized as such by the profession. More and more attention is devoted to it by more and more of the field's most eminent men \[sic\]. If it still continues to resist, as it usually does not, many of them may come to view its resolution as *the* subject matter of their discipline. For them the field will no longer look quite the same as it had earlier. Part of its different appearance results simply from the new fixation point of scientific scrutiny. An even more important source of change is the divergence of the numerous partial solutions that concerted attention to the problem has made available. The early attacks upon the resistant. problem will have followed the paradigm rules quite closely. But with continuing resistance, more and more of the attacks upon it will have involved some minor or not so minor articulation of the paradigm, not two of them quite alike, each partially successful, but none sufficiently so to be accepted as paradigm by the group. Through this proliferation of divergent articulations (more and more frequently they will come to be described as *ad hoc* adjustments), the rules of normal science become increasingly blurred. Though there still is a paradigm, few practitioners prove to be entirely agreed about what it is. Even formerly standard solutions of solved problems are called in question.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say you're a creationist, and you have a piece of research that you want to present at a big event where lots of other creationists (and ID proponents, if you distinguish them) are present. You're walking around and looking at an exhibit of posters, not unlike you'd see at a typical scientific meeting.

The ""proliferation of theories"" you'd see would be remarkable. You might see something about the Cambrian explosion, hydroplates, biblical interpretation, mutation rates, sedimentology of the Grand Canyon, information theory, and so on. But not only would the subjects diverge widely, they'd also contradict each other: the Cambrian explosion material would rely on traditional geological dating techniques, while another guy's poster about ""polonium haloes"" would call all dating into question. Each contributor might have a different idea of how to recognize a ""created kind"". When looking at a poster, you'd have to check what the author's theoretical background is. Even ""YEC"" is not enough: apparently, creationist can't agree about using the Septuagint or Masoretic Text versions of the bible. In conversations with other creationists, you'd often come to the conclusion that the person you're talking to is operating on a totally different level, and doesn't share some of your most basic ideas, even though you're both creationists and supposedly have something in common. That in itself is not so bad, but the problem would be that your paradigm offers no solutions for working out the differences. Each solution offered would just divide the adherents of the paradigm more, it would be another ""ad hoc"" addition.

This situation is very much what Kuhn describes above. Creationists respond to new data like a scientists in a true scientific field would do when confronted by a crisis. They can't agree on a solution and they can't unify their theories into a paradigm.

This implies that there should be one or more anomalies that plague creationism. The problem here is not that these anomalies can't be solved - creationists offer solutions to any problem, although quite a few of these solutions involve just sticking a finger in each ear - but rather that these solutions don't work as ""puzzle solutions"" in terms of the original paradigm.

Since creationism as we know it now was conceived long after Darwin came up with a scientifically workable theory of evolution (see Michael Ruse, *The Evolution-Creation Struggle*) the biggest anomaly has from the start been evolution itself. So one could justifiably say that creationism knew crisis from the start. But radiometric dating, historical geology, and genetics have put innumerable anomalies in front of creationists, a lot which have divided it even more. The time that was ""devoted by eminent men"" was spent on tackling anomalies right from the start, and this work piled up faster than they could handle. There never was any normal puzzle-solving to begin with.

And therefore, regardless of whether it is true or false, creationism has never been able to grow out of being a pseudoscience.",24,1557996827,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bpa5rz/creationism_as_a_paradigm_in_crisis/

Cetaceans roam our oceans today as both immense predators and gentle giants. From the tiny Vaquita to the enormous Blue Whale (the largest animal currently known to inhabit our planet in all it's history) these marine mammals occupy some of the niches left open by the extinct sea-going reptiles of old. They began this journey some 50-55 million year ago as a terrestrial hoofed mammal no larger than a housecat. 

What drove this return to the sea? What evidence do we have to support it? How could it occur so quickly? 

This post aims to document the evolutionary transitions of cetaceans from their humble terrestrial beginnings to the majesty of the great organisms roaming our seas today, as well as examine the genetic and embryologic evidence for this journey. Finally, we will examine some of the qualms YEC sites have with the entire idea.

Let's get started!

**Part 1: Feet and Fins**

As usual with these posts, we must identify what separates our ""starting"" species or genus from our ""ending"" species or genus. It is important to keep in mind that our classifications of organisms is an attempt to categorize a gradient of ever-changing forms; it's somewhat arbitrary. That said, these classifications serve to help us observe evolutionary trends.

Although first we must define some of the aspects of our modern cetacean's classification. 

Modern cetaceans are apart of the order *Artiodactyla*, or, the even-toed ungulates. These are hoofed animals who bear weight on an even number of toes. But they have other defining characteristics, such as their scapula shape and unique joints (trochlear hinges) built for maintaining stability at high speeds.

The latter, is why we classify cetaceans in artiodactyla: They have hind limbs that are stunted in development, but display *artiodactyl characteristics*: the [**trochlear hinges (astragalus)**](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDGwhales/Whales.htm)

These traits are absolutely unique to artiodactyls, and all modern animals classified as such possess them: including the cetaceans. 

Which leads us to out most basal form: [Indohyus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indohyus)

Indohyus lived some 48-55 million years ago, and has all the traits one would desire in an artiodactyl: four limbs under the body, a rostral pair of nostrils, **hooves with trochlear hinges**, mobile scapula, a short skull, conical tail, bulky shape and not much else. Except... it does have a unique trait: the **involucrum.** This is a bony middle ear structure which is today, *UNIQUE to cetaceans and no other animal.* Additionally, Indohyus has bone density similar to Hippos, the most genetically close relative to cetaceans in living organisms.

This is why we start with Indohyus:

**Indohyus Traits**

* Four limbs below body
* nasal opening at end of snout
*  bulky non-streamlined shape with weight-bearing pelvis
*  short skull
*  terrestrial
* Heterodont Teeth
* Conical tail
* Involucrum 

**Modern Cetacean Traits**

* Two distinguished fins no hindlimbs (save the non-weight-bearing pelvis and reduced femur)
*  blowhole (dorsocranial nasal opening)
* streamlined shape
*  elongated skull
*  aquatic
* Monodont teeth
*  tail flukes
* Involucrum

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: The Whales of this Tale**

The evolutionary change takes place over 13-15 million years. This seems like a short amount of time, but this will be addressed later. First lets take a look at the organisms in this lineage. 

As usual, it is important to remember the bushy nature of life, taphonomy and fossilization. Even though we have what appears to be a concise and stepwise transition of forms, species can persist past their progeny's emergence and forms are *likely* not truly direct, but rather depict a gradient of traits appearing and overall evolutionary trends. 

If this is not properly understood or outright rejected there is not much point in further discussion.

This is seen in practice when we meet the ""next"" on the line, whose fossil exists before and alongside Indohyus:

[**Pakicetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakicetus)**: 52-48 MYA:** More wolf-like, Pakicetus has a narrower snout, and has lost the characteristic dental trait of mammals: specialization of the teeth (heterodontia), and a deducible dental formula. Instead, it has the conical teeth most carnivorous cetaceans have (monodontia). 

Now this animal has webbed feet rather than hooves. How do we know it's related to indohyus? It has the **ARTIODACTYL KNEE AND ANKLE, complete with troclear hinges**. This is stunning, because no carnivorous animal today HAS artiodactyl knees/ankle... but all cetaceans have the remnants of them. Pakicetus ALSO has the **involucrum.** It's bone chemistry suggests a freshwater lifestyle with excursions into, but not permanent living in, the water.

Currently it is suggested that Pakicetus and Indohyus shared a common ancestor with an involucrum, and not the the latter begat the former. This is especially due to the existence of the [Mesonychids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonychid): hoofed carnivores who also lived in the Eocene. These organisms are in a similar position as Pakicetus: hoofed animals with toes (hoofs becoming a sort of nail analogue). It has been proposed that the Mesonychids gave rise to the pakicetids, [but molecular evidence has rejected this hypothesis.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11783081_Skeletons_of_terrestrial_cetaceans_and_the_relationship_of_whales_to_artiodactyls)

The reason Indohyus is included however is due to it's possession of the involucrum which is unique to cetaceans and no current terrestrial life making it a relative, if perhaps a more distant offshoot.

[**Ambulocetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulocetus)**: 47.8-41.3 MYA** arrives on the scene next, Mid-Eocene, and resembles a large mammalian crocodile. Bone analysis shows a delta-lifestyle with some time in saline and some in freshwater. It also has the **artiodactyl joints (TH)** and the involucrum, but unlike pakicetus, ambulocetus is beginning to grow sluggish on land. It's hindlimb structure is just not quite as conducive to terrestrial locomotion.

In comparison to the pakicetids, these guys have more robust feet and a more flexible spine. They also have transitioning orbits (positioned dorsally but not yet frontated) precisely like current amphibious mammals such as hippos. This is ideal for peering out of the water while submerged! 

[**Rodhocetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodhocetus) **48.6-40 MYA** AGAIN have the **involucrum** and the **artiodactyl joints**. This guy has a new cetacean-only trait in the making: **four of it's sacral vertebra are partially fused.** In cetaceans today, ALL the sacral vert. are fused. This animal has a bone density of saltwater exclusivity, and has nostrils beginning to move up dorsally. This is not surprising, as we now have the pressure to breathe without the effort a rostral nostril would require.

This organism likely lived alongside Ambulocetus for a while, especially since they occupied different niches. Species exist in both the rodhocetid and ambulocetid genera that actively display the variety even within these larger categorizations. 

[**Dorudon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorudon)**: 40-33.9 MYA.** Still, **involucrum** and **artiodactyl joints**. Now the sacrum is fully fused as well, and the nostrils are MORE dorsal than before. Eyes have moved frontally now, and some paleontologists have suggested the existence of tail flukes. Hind limbs are still ""useful"" in and of themselves, but gone are the webbed feet: it has flippers. Wholly marine, dorudon has all the traits of a modern cetacean save the fully dorsal blowhole, fully developed melon organ, fully interal hind limbs and large brain.

[**Basilosaurus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilosaurus) **40-35 MYA** is enormous and nearly a full cetacean. It has all of Dorudon's traits (including that involucrum and the artiodactyl knee/ankle) as well as it's general streamlined shape. The blowhole is even more dorsal in comparison though, and the hind flippers are all but internal. The braincase is still somewhat small from the social cetaceans of today though. But for intents and purposes, this is a near-cetacean.

Additionally are the [**Remingtoncetids**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remingtonocetidae) **(47-43 MYA)** who are considered relatives of modern cetaceans, but as offshoots or ""cousins"". These strange beasts resembled mammalian gharial with narrow muzzles stacked with thin teeth. They have been found with the protocetids (rodhocetids) as well as with ancient crocodiles, sirenians and catfish. [Never](https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/459.pdf) with indohyus, pakicetus or ambulocetus who predate this genera in some cases and vary in habitat in others. They also posses the involucrum and artiodactyl joints. 

Thus in the lineage for cetaceans a rough separation can be made: 

**Basal hoofed Goup**

Indohyus and perhaps Indohyus and Pakicetus's CA

**Most Basal Cetaceans**

Pakicetids and Ambulocetids

**Protocetids and Remingtoncetids**

Rhodocetus and the Remintongtoncetids

**Basal Obligate Marine Whales**

Dorudon and Basilosaurus 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: The Timeline (and molecular data)**

[Timetree.org](https://Timetree.org) allows one to pull general timelines from compiled molecular data ([How they do it](http://www.hedgeslab.org/pubs/260.pdf)). This source backs up the timeline for cetacean proliferation over the course of 13-15 million years. This kind of change seems quite large over that period of time, but empirically it is supported by mutation rates and transitional fossils.

The same site, among many others, support our own evolution from the chimpanzee-like S. tchadensis in a mere 7-9 million years. 

What these two events (and many others of ""fast"" evolution) have in common is that they are seemingly spurred by environmental change. In our own lineage this resulted from the East African Rift creating a sparse savanna not idea for arboreal quadrupeds. And in the cetaceans we see the opening of the niches left by the marine reptiles. 

This is seen in modern times as well with the [Pod Mrcaru Lizards](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/04/lizard-evolution-island-darwin/).

Essentially, individuals from a parent population on one Italian island were relocated to a new island (5 pairs, so 5 males and 5 females) back in 1971. Researchers then checked in on them 50 years later, and found that the lizards had undergone rapid evolutionary change in response to a new food source.

The lizards on the parent island were insectivorous, but the new population had switched to herbivorous habits. The new lizards had adaptions for herbivory seen in only 1% of all lizards: cecal valves, hindgut bacteria for digesting foliage and a new skull shape built for managing leaf eating. All in just 50 years!

Selection becomes highly directional when there is enough environmental pressure is the long and short of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4: It's all Genes to me**

If evolutionary theory in this case is valid, than the genes will tell us. Since evolution works by tweaking precursor structures (even at the molecular level), we should find remnants of cetacean's terrestrial past in their genome. The first place to look would be for the formation of hindlimbs in embryological development, but we will go over that in embryology. 

Shubin goes over this very topic in his book ""Your Inner Fish"". He notes that all mammals have some 3% of their total genome dedicated to odor detection, including cetaceans. But in these animals, who have over one thousand genes dedicated to smelling and picking up scents in the air (just like all mammals), *every single gene is non-functional.* 

As a result, they also lack a proper gustatory sense (taste), and [some believe](https://zoologicalletters.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40851-014-0002-z) this contributes to the proportionally high number of cetaceans ingesting toxic debris. 

[Bone mass](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/10/3/967/4935247) has also been identified genetically, and found to have been positively selected for: 

"" Comparative genomic analyses of cetaceans and their terrestrial relatives provided several novel insights into the distinct evolutionary scenarios of adaptation to a fully aquatic lifestyle. Genes associated with oxidation–reduction and immune process were found to be accompanied by pseudogene copies. Genes under positive selection in the cetaceans were related to reproduction, keratin protein, learning, and energy turnover. This was interesting given their special lifestyle compared with other mammals. Our study also documented the bone microstructure across mammals and marine mammals, and for the first time, revealed the benefit of using a phylogenetic comparative approach to study the evolution of bone compactness. Our findings offer valuable information on genes critical for adaptation to aquatic life of mammals in diverse environments. ""

Just these two examples pose some large questions to the proposal of intelligent design and progressive creationism.

**Part 5: Embryology** 

Equally as fascinating as the genes is the development. Just as we as humans bear some of the traces of our fore-bearers in-utero, so do cetaceans. 

Modern cetaceans undergo a stage in their embryological development where they begin to develop hindlimbs, just as they do their forelimbs. This is what is considered business as usual. But the development of the hindlimbs terminates soon after the buds form, and they waste away until only the pelvis and some femoral remnants are left (as they are first to form). 

You can find these stages pictured [here](https://evolutionforskeptics.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny-fetal-whales-have-hindlimb-buds/) by actual cetacean embryos.

What has appeared to have happened is that a mutation halts the development at a predetermined point each time a pup develops. Studies have pinpointed what happens [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/22/8414) : ""... cetacean embryos do initiate hind-limb bud development. In dolphins, the bud arrests and degenerates around the fifth gestational week. Initial limb outgrowth in amniotes is maintained by two signaling centers, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). Our data indicate that the cetacean hind-limb bud forms an AER and that this structure expresses Fgf8 initially, but that neither the AER nor Fgf8 expression is maintained.""

Some Creationists have proposed the existence of the pelvis is for copulatory purposes in the male cetaceans, and it may well be, but this is not an explanation for the hindlimbs themselves, nor the convoluted process that forms both.

**Part 6: YEC perspective**

As a forward here, much of these arguments boil down to ""You have Pakicetus and Ambulocetus but wheres the transition between those two!"" and ""Not enough Time"".

ICR starts us off with: ""Scientific Roadblocks to Whale Evolution""

*"" A number of land animals have been proposed as the whale's ancestor, including Darwin's bear, grazing ungulates, wolf-like carnivores (Mesonyx), and the hippopotamus. In each case the morphological differences are significant. If whales (cetaceans) did evolve from land mammals, they did so at an unbelievable rate, accruing an amazing number of ""beneficial"" mutations and adaptations.""*

This is appealing to the issue of time, and also never actually mentions the proposed first cetacean: Pakicetus. It goes so far as to suggest Ambulocetus the following paragraph:

*""The skeletal features would need to change radically, as well as the physiology (the collective functions of an organism). For example, the supposed early ""whale,"" Ambulocetus, drank fresh water probably throughout its life ""50 million years ago,"" and Indocetus was a saltwater drinker ""48 million years ago."" This means that in perhaps three million years there had to be an extreme change in the physiology of these creatures.""*

This article was written in 1998 and pakicetus was found in 1981 so I'm not sure why it is never mentioned. Additionally this salinity ""problem"" ignores the analysis of ambulocetus's bones, which show a clear brackish lifestyle in between pakicetus's more freshwater and rodhocetus's more marine. 

It goes on to complain about maintaining heat in the cold recesses of deepwater, apparently ignorant of both blubber and polar animals who possess it in favor of creating an issue with homeostasis that is not problematic. 

AiG is also out and about with ""Fossil Evidence of Whale Evolution""

This involves Terry sending a message to talkorigins which is both brave and malinformed. This article doesn't simply pose nonpromblematic issues, but presents a very flagrant misunderstanding of what it is trying to refute. Some highlights:

*"" Certainly there has been diversification within the whale kinds (see what I mean about “kind” in point 2 below). But how do you know that what you have been told about certain fossils is really evidence of the evolution of whales from some land animal? How do you know that the fossils can be arranged in a nice neat record of successively younger rocks? You are not a paleontologist and didn’t dig up the fossils. Given the statement by Raup about horse fossils (*[*in the first part of this article*](https://answersingenesis.org/charles-darwin/darwinism/was-darwin-right/)*), I certainly will not trust evolutionist claims without careful examination. ""*

The fossils are arranged according to the age of the rock they are found in (via radiometric dating, a [very accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) method of telling the age of igneous rock). Because these fossils can be separated by general age, the trend of the emergence of traits can be observed, creating a succinct means of examining change over time.

I do appreciate the ""You weren't there"" aspect of ""historical science"" being applied to literally digging up a fossil, followed by a warning not to trust ""evolutionists"". Frequently AiG likes to bring up paleontologic hoaxes, unaware they are quite rare in comparison to hoaxes of artifacts of historical antiquity and art. 

*""I have no idea what you mean by saying, “‘Arrival of the fittest’ is of course a biological question and has little to do with evolution.” Isn’t evolution a hypothesis about the origin of biological life? Do you mean that the origin of the first living cell is a question that has little to do with evolution? If so, I disagree. It has everything to do with it. If evolutionists can’t explain how the first living, reproducing cell came into existence by time, chance, and the laws of nature working on non-living matter, then the theory of evolution is dead. Natural selection and mutations can only work on living, reproducing organisms.""*

Dreadful. This false equivalency is why so many secular (and religious but conventional) scientists are quick to be wary of Creationists. Abiogenesis is not evolution, and it simply doesn't matter how much Terry misunderstands this or blatantly disagrees because it is a hard and fast definitions game.

*"" Actually, time is not the hero of the plot, but the villain. Time doesn’t create anything. With the help of the Second Law of Thermodynamics it destroys things. The more time we have, the more mutations destroy genetic information, as Spetner’s and Sanford’s books above persuasively show.""*

A misunderstanding of what constitutes ""new"" genetic information (for which AiG lacks a definition for *anyways*) in conventional science, and another misuse of the 2nd Law. The Earth is not a closed system Terry!

*""Evolution and millions of years hopelessly fail to explain our world. They don’t explain the origin and diversification of genetic information, the origin of incredible design in living things, and the origin of human language, which is vastly different and superior to any animal communication. They don’t explain the fossil record or the thousands of feet of sedimentary rock layers (some of which extend for tens of thousands of square miles). They don’t explain the orderly design of the solar system. And while evolutionists assume the validity of the laws of nature, their evolutionary ideas cannot explain why those laws are valid. And the evolutionary view provides no basis for purpose and meaning in life or any absolute morality.""*

I think this is something of a ""cart before the horse"" scenario given he's already fighting a version of evolutionary theory that does not exist. But I would love to see Terry tackle the issues geology, cosmology and paleontology present to his worldview once he's gotten a grasp on what he's actually against.

**Conclusion/ TL;DR**

Through 13-15 million years of geologic time the transition of terrestrial hoofed mammals to the cetaceans of today is well documented in transitional fossils. The persistence of identifying morphologic traits (involucrum and artiodactyl joints) supports this notion along with current molecular data, genome maps and embryology. 

Critics tend to focus on the intangible (prove specific mutation X in a lab) or the non-problematic (timescale), and in the context of this post are not educated in the area in which they are critiquing.

The aforementioned course is an AP course (Advanced Placement, for those outside North America), and as such I have a deeper understanding than your typical Bio student, which I hope to utilise to make my point here. Also, **this post presumes that the reader has a preexisting knowledge of biology and knows the definition of many words specific to biology, but if any reader does not, I would be happy to provide a definition/brief synopsis of a process.**

I have studied life in order of gradually increasing complexity, begging at the molecules essential to life and progressing up to the organisation of ecosystems and the biosphere as a whole. All of it fundamentally supports the idea of evolution, but one thing I found especially interesting was endosymbiont theory.  

Endosymbiont theory states that mitochondria and chloroplasts and other plastids came about as a result of a larger cell engulfing a smaller one--capable of aerobic cellular respiration--that managed to avoid digestion and proved as an asset to the larger cell. [Here is a graphic that explains it quite well.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Serial_endosymbiosis.svg) 

The proof for this theory abounds: 

1. New mitochondria and plastids form through binary fission in a manner very similar to prokaryotes. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Three_cell_growth_types.svg) is a graphic showing the difference between binary fission and mitosis.
2. If you remove the mitochondria and/or plastids from a cell, the cell is unable to replace them, strongly suggesting that they do not originate from the cell itself. 
3. Mitochondrial and plastid ribosomes are more similar to the ribosomes (the organelles that make protein using mRNA transcripts) of bacteria than the ribosomes of the cells that contain them \[[source](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050209)\]
4. Some mitochondria and plastids contain circular DNA that closely resembles bacterial DNA in structure \[[source](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1271)\] *(this source also shows why organelle genomes are much smaller than what their historical, free-living counterparts would have been, due to lateral DNA transfer of DNA from the organelle into the genome of the ""host"" cell)*, and that DNA bears many resemblances to Rickettsial bacteria (in the case of mitochondria) \[[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9823893)\] and cyanobacteria (in the case of chloroplasts) \[[source](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/5/1/31/727700)\]

And that proof of endosymbiont theory in turn supports an evolutionary process, not a creationist one:

1. Why would this occur in any other circumstance? The cell continuously fabricates more membrane for the formation of vesicles, so why does it not just fabricate its own facilities to fulfil the absolutely necessary process of cellular respiration?
2. Considering that mitochondria are absolutely essential to the survival of all aerobic cells, this would be an extreme error on the part of any ""creator."" Why design something unable to replace such essential missing parts?
3. Again, how and why would this even occur in a creationist reality; would it not be much more practical to have all the machinery for essential cellular processes originate and be able to be reproduced by the cell itself?
4. What would be the reason for the genetic similarities between cellular organelles and free-living bacteria if there was no such thing as evolution?

Again, if you do not understand the many biology-specific words used in this post (whatever spellchecking service the Reddit editor uses certainly didn't, judging by the presence of many squiggly red lines under almost all of the bio-specific words), feel free to ask for a definition or explanation, or turn to the wider internet and learn from there.",6,1556855647,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bk43zo/endosymbiont_theory_among_many_other_things/

An Analysis on the Tetrapod Tracks of Poland

(Or Why Date Changes for Emergence are Not Problematic)

I would like to thank Jonathandavid77 for their enormous help with this post, both in concept in in backing their claims with sources!

Recently I posted about tetrapod evolution both on debateevolution and on creationevolution, the latter of which generated some discussion of the legitimacy of my claims. There were some genuinely good queries and challenges, particularly from eagles107, who brought up a facet of the research regarding tetrapods I was not aware of: A series of tetrapod-like tracks was discovered in Poland back in 2010, dated some 18 million years older than the first tetrapod body fossil (Acanthostega, 365 MYA).

The implications of this are interesting depending on your perspective, point being this was brought up as an example of opposition to Evolution (as a concept).

In this post, I aim to explore the nature of these trackways (both the factual and the “to-be-determined”), as well as the impact that they would/will make if they are truly tetrapodomorph in nature. In addition, we will address the frequent and growing talking point of paleontologic date-change among Creationists, and how this is typically interpreted among conventional scientists.

I invite Eagles107 to give their opinion if they’d like, and MRH2 as well (who had some questions I aim to explore a bit). Additionally, I would like to thank stcodova for pinning the discussion on his sub and maintaining cordiality despite disagreement.

**The Players (a quick refresher)**

Tetrapods, “Fishy Tetrapodomorphs” (Elpistostegalians) and Sarcopterygians

The Sarcoperygians, or lobe-finned fish, persist today, but the lineage beget by Eusthenopteron is potentially that which eventually led to the tetrapods. These organisms have primarily “fish” traits but possess certain tetrapod characteristics (such as skull roofing or labrynthodont teeth).

The “Fishy Tetrapodomorphs” are a colloquial name for the Epistostegalians (mosaics). These organisms have both lobe-finned fish traits and tetrapod traits, and can be difficult to categorize. Examples include Panderichthys and Tiktaalik.

Tetrapoda is a superclass including all mammals, reptiles (birds as well) and amphibians. This group is considered by mainstream science to have emerged sometime in the Devonian period from a line of sarcopterygians and then elpistostegalians. Examples include Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Ventastega Tulerpeton and Proterogyrinus.

A more in depth look can be found at the original post:

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bfz2v5/transitional_species_handbook_tetrapods_mammals/)

**The Tracks: What We Know from the Original Paper**

The original paper breaking the news of these tracks was by the authors and titled “Tetrapod Trackways from the early Middle Devonian Period of Poland” and is by Niedzwiedzki’s team.

The paper begins with what we have already covered: tetrapods evolved from elpithostegalians, who evolved from sarcopterygians living around 385 MYA. The paper notes: this is when the eusthenopteron body fossils we have are *dated to*. This is not when the species is thought to have *emerged.* It goes on to assert that the found tetrapod trackways indicate there is a misconception of not only when tetrapods likely emerged, but the environment in which they did so.

**Tracks have been confirmed to have been made** ***underwater***\*\*, due to both the substrate\*\* **composition and cohesiveness of the sediment in relation to the tracks.**

The paper covered two trackways then: **PGI.16 and PGI.15**

PGI.16 indicates an organism with 7 or 8 digits on the hind limbs, with no digit impressions for the forelimbs. Spacing and absence of body drag are thought to indicate a tetrapod trackway (think how an amphibian “walks” along the bottom of a water body). Angles of the prints indicate morphology dissimilar to the elpistostegalians (removing known species panderichthys and tiktaalik as potential culprits).

PGI.15 indicates an organism much more like panderichthys or tiktaalik, with few strides that suggest “pulling along” with just the front legs. Tracks are smaller and ladder-like, and body drag is not confirmed or denied.

The paper goes on to note how many isolated prints were also found, and the entire assemblage was “In many ways similar to previously described Devonian tetrapod tracks.” It is important to note no prints indicated reptilian presence (no claw marks).

“The best preserved Zachelmie prints are quite similar to the pes morphology of Acanthostega and, in particular, Ichthyostega (Fig. 4b, c).” This is followed by the observation these tracks were likely made by large stem-group tetrapods in fully marine, intertidal environments and lagoons alike.

It concludes then with a statement that will become important later:

“Until now, the replacement of elpithistegids by tetrapods in the in the body-fossil record during the mid-late Frasnian has appeared to reflect an evolutionary event, with the elpistostegids as a short-lived “transitional grade” between fish and tetrapods monotypes (Fig. 5a). In fact, tetrapods and elpithostegids coexisted for 10 million years (Fig. 5b). This implies the elpithostegid morphology was not a brief transitional stage, but a stable adaptive position in its own right. It is reminiscent of the lengthy coexistence of non-volant but feathered and ‘winged’ theropod dinosaurs with the volant stem-group birds during the Mezozoic.”

[The Paper (Paywall)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08623)

**The Tracks: What New Research Says**

As always with finds that have the potential to change scientific status quo, these tracks have been heavily contested through the years.

[Lungfish](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5037403/) have been suggested

And [Neil Shubin](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/spot-the-tiktaalik/), tiktaalik’s discoverer, has suggested it could be the likes of “walking fish” (frogfish, mudskippers etc)

But in addition to that, much research has been done to confirm the paper’s findings. Some successful and some inconclusive.

In 2018, researchers did work with the geology of the location, and suggested that while the tracks were made underwater, it is likely a lagoon or brackish environment akin to an [ephemeral lake.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322571065_Non-marine_palaeoenvironment_associated_to_the_earliest_tetrapod_tracks)

But an earlier paper in 2011 suggests a more marine environment. This is accompanied by the use of modern molecular data in order to determine the divergence of the earliest tetrapods. Interestingly enough, their conclusion matched that of the [Poland Trackways](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022136):

“The change in environmental conditions played a major role in their evolution. According to our analysis this evolution occurred at about 397–416 MYA during the Early Devonian unlike previously thought. This idea is supported by various environmental factors such as sea levels and oxygen rate, and biotic factors such as biodiversity of arthropods and coral reefs. The molecular data also strongly supports lungfish as tetrapod's closest living relative.”

And another in 2013 piggybacks on the divergence time with [mutation rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653398?dopt=Abstract):

So that leaves some questions doesn’t it?

**The Tracks: What are we certain of?**

What we know is that we have a set of tracks and trackways in Poland that certainly appear to be tetrapodean in nature, albeit “early” in form. Both these claims are backed by the fact that some prints had digits, at least 7 and potentially 8. This matches the earliest tetrapods we have: Acanthostega and Ichthyostega.

But we can’t be certain of the species. All we know is that it is potentially one of these two, or a tetrapod very similar in morphology. This claim is backed by the required skeletal and muscular structure required to make these tracks.

We know the tracks were made underwater, thanks to the substrate composition and cohesion. But we can’t be sure if it was marine coast/inlet or a brackish lagoon at this point.

We can be certain of the dates as well, and that they place this organism well before our first body fossil of Eusthenopteron.

So what does this mean?

**The Nature of Emergence: What the Tracks Mean**

The discoverers of the tracks can be quoted in their original paper: “This implies the elpistostegid morphology was not a brief transitional stage, but a stable adaptive position in its own right. It is reminiscent of the lengthy coexistence of non-volant but feathered and ‘winged’ theropod dinosaurs with the volant stem-group birds during the Mezozoic.”

Creationists point to the coexistence of the likely-tetrapod and the likely-elpistostegid and remark that it is indicative of creation rather than evolution.

But the founders of the tracks say very much the opposite: **The coexistence is indicative of evolution working as it should;** ***forms that work stick around.***

Jonathandavid77 made an excellent point themselves in their comment on the post at creationevolution: “The ages of the fossils does not give us the date when they speciated. All we know is that the species existed when the creature died. The dates on these fossils are consistent with a late Devonian age for the evolution of tetrapods. In fact, they line up well.

It should also be remembered that fish like Eusthenopteron and similar forms didn't suddenly go extinct when tetrapods appeared. There were still sarcopterygians, just like are descended from apes, but apes are still around.”

This point is compounded on when we consider the lineage the authors point out: that of birds. Which leads me to my next point:

**Contemporary Fossils are Not Problematic**

This argument is but a dressed up version of ""If humans came from monkeys why are there still monkeys?""

The habitats conducive to tiktaalik are the same which would be conducive to acanthostega or panderichtys. Yet somehow it seems absurd to YEC’s to consider the idea that a species that was successful enough to proliferate and evolve didn’t just die off after leaving progeny behind. In fact it is important to note that **this very idea of stepwise proliferation and extinction runs contra to evolutionary theory’s principle of Natural Selection**.

In addition to this, evolutionary theory in application to transitional fossils has a very important caveat that so many seem to miss: **Transitional fossils serve to measure overall trends in traits and trait ratios.**

This means it doesn’t matter one bit to evolutionary theory if an organism with a few more derived traits lives before what is traditionally considered transitional, and birds are a great example!

Animals very similar to what we could consider modern birds lived in the late cretaceous **alongside** feathered theropods. That does not change the fact that the overall emergence of traits and ratio of traits in a given lineage matches **evolutionary theory perfectly.**

The semilunate carpal arrives in a tiny, scaly, “classic” theropod named Compsognathus, and is never lost throughout the following lineage.

[My post on birds](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdcgoz/transitional_species_handbook_birds_are_the/) goes more in depth on which traits tend to stick around in that bushy linegae.

**What about Time?**

Jonathandavid77 made an excellent response to MRH2 when the question of change in a “short” amount of time was asked. How long does it take realistically for a eusthenopteron to yield a lineage that looked like panderichthys?

Jonathandavid77 noted that the change is not large first and foremost, and cited Gaining Ground: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods by Jennifer Clack covering the skeletal changes required. They also noted that 5 million years is quite a bit of time when compared to the evolution required in 4000 after Noah’s Flood, or 6000 from the YEC timescale.

They source the mutation rate as well: “There is good evidence that, given reasonable mutation rates, the divergence between tetrapods and other sarcopterygians happened in the Devonian period: [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653398?dopt=Abstract)”

Finally, we can look to the Pod Mrcaru lizards as well to see quick change over time. individuals from a parent population on one Italian island were relocated to a new island (5 pairs, so 5 males and 5 females) back in 1971. Researchers then checked in on them 50 years later, and found that the lizards had undergone rapid evolutionary change in response to a new food source.

The lizards on the parent island were insectivorous, but the new population had switched to herbivorous habits. The new lizards had adaptions for herbivory seen in only 1% of all lizards: cecal valves, hindgut bacteria for digesting foliage and a new skull shape built for managing leaf eating! All in just 50 years!

**Not All Science is Equal (Evidently)**

Finally, we come to the most common criticism I have seen (anecdotally) in regard to paleontology. Creationists are keen to point out when the dates change for a species’ emergence or the timescale for a given evolutionary change.

Mind you, the change is (to my knowledge) never the result of incorrect radiometric dating, but rather from finding a new specimen in a new area of rock.

It should be noted as well: *things almost exclusively get older when dates change.* Pollen is found earlier, or tracks mark a more ancient divergence. And these number remain in the hundreds of millions.

But the crux of the issue isn’t that these dates change; of course they change. It is rare to get something right the first time when the answer rests on discovery.

The problem is the attitude behind this one particular branch of study that includes many fields: those which pertain to life origins and evolution.

You will rarely find a Creationist complain when Physics alters itself (classic example being the abandonment of Newtonian Physics for Stellar bodies in favor of Relativity) but if the date is changed by a mere 10 million years (in a 4.8 billion year scale) the entire science must be tossed out with the bathwater.

This is despite Evolutionary Theory’s ability to make predictions within it’s own field. Tiktaalik’s finding is often used but I am going to make a different argument.

Before these trackways, the timescale was based off of found body-fossil dates. This is reasonable, and no cause for doubt existed. But with the discovery of the tracks, there suddenly was this large question mark for the tetrapod lineage. Why were tracks appearing earlier? This gave us reason to check our previous notions with new technology and methods.

And when this was done via [molecular data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022136) it was found that the tracks were correct, and divergence given by the molecular data matched them almost to a tee. **This would not have been done if it weren’t for the tracks, but here we have two independent methods corroborated the new date for divergence.** This is how discovery in science works: if data is presented that drastically challenges your status quo, you must reevaluate.

And this is something I have yet to see major YEC organizations do.

**Conclusions/TL;DR**

The Poland Tetrapod Tracks give near-absolute reason to reevaluate when these organisms emerged, and are corroborated by independent research, mutation rates, and molecular data. Contrary to Creationist claims, paleontologists (both the discoverers and others) see this as an example of successful forms persisting past evolutionary divergence. Additionally, the tracks embody morphologic trends seen in known species of the fossil record, further confirming the previously held notions of evolution of forms in tetrapods. While there is much to learn about these tracks and tetrapod evolution, we can be certain that according to conventional science (including the long-held ideas of Evolutionary Theory) they are abjectly not problematic.",14,1556349093,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bhwmlq/an_analysis_on_the_tetrapod_tracks_of_poland/

Tetrapoda is a superclass including all mammals, reptiles (birds as well) and amphibians. This group is considered by mainstream science to have emerged sometime in the Devonian period around 350 to 380 MYA from a line of sarcopterygians, or lobe finned fish. This group includes modern coelacanth and itself is likely an evolutionary lineage descending from the proto-lungfish known as [Dipterus](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/d/dipterus.html). 

How do we know this? Are there any criticisms? 

The following post will examine the various fossil transitions we have from Eusthenopteron to the Tetrapodomorphs (and Temnospondyls), and examine the YEC criticisms of this lineage.

**Part 1: A Fish Called Eusthenopteron** 

As always, the first task with examining transitional species is to identify the primary differing traits between the organisms with traits considered more ""primitive"" and that with traits considered more ""derived"". These terms aren't ideal, and it should be noted that in this post we are primarily using them to denote change in traits through geologic time. 

**Eusthenopteron Traits**

* “Fish” style skull (tall and narrow, sockets to the sides)
* No neck or cervical-style vertebrae
* No distinct hind-limbs
* “Webbed” tailfin
*  No distinct digits
* No true wrist
* External Gills (with gill chamber)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tetrapodomorph Traits**

* “Tetrapod” style skull (flat and wide, sockets angled forward)
*  Neck and cervical vertebrae
*  Distinct hind-limbs
* Reduced tail that usually drags
*  Distinct digits
* True Wrist
* No External gills

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2: The Land Before Spine**

The Devonian period was an odd time. It is generally known as the ""Age of Fishes"", but it should be noted that at this same time vast fern-like forests were beginning to stretch across the land, continuing their invasion from the Ordovician millions of years earlier. This is important, as the more the plants dominate, the more available habitat for the arthropods: a future food source for the tetrapods! 

But for the most part this is a warm and humid time; ideal for more invaders from the sea. With the coast as free real estate, the sarcopterygians of the pelagic zone have an opportunity to seize. 

[**Euthentopteron**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/e/eusthenopteron.html)  **(385 MYA)**

Euthenopteron is definitely a fish, but it bears unique characteristics that will come in handy in it's descendants future on land. It is the only organism in the sea during this time to have labrynthodont teeth, a trait found in the first tetrapods, as well as the skull roofing pattern and appendicular bones which appear in the vertebrate land lubbers. Its fin endoskeleton, which appears to be a more advanced version of the Devonian coelacanth’s, bears a distinct humerus, ulna, and radius (in the fore-fin) and femur, tibia, and fibula (in the pelvic fin). However, this animal is still clearly a fish. It bears gills and a webbed tail fin, lacks a neck, a true wrist and tetrapod vertebrae.

[**Panderichthys**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/p/panderichthys.html) **(380 MYA)**

While again, clearly still a fish (gills, fins, webbed tailfin, no neck or true wrist) we see the beginnings of the wrist and forearm developing skeletally. Compared to Eusthenopteron, the skull shares more in common with tetrapods than fish, both in roofing and in shape (flatter than it is tall). The pelvic girdle continues to develop as well, and the dorsal and anal fins have vanished. The vertebral column is ossified and beginning to look more like the spine of a tetrapod. Nares are moving to a tetrapodomorph position as well. This animal likely did not leave water, but the pectorals are developed enough that it is possible it was capable of squirming from closely located bodies of water. 

[**Tiktaalik**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/t/tiktaalik.html) **(375 MYA)**

Neil Shubins famous transitional! Tiktaalik is a lovely mosaic of traits: Head is flat and wide like the tetrapods.

a wrist that is continuing to advance (bones differentiating), the interior bones of arm/wrist are stronger and padded for “pushing up” and the eyes are on the TOP of the skull. Tiktaalik bears bones for heavy pectoral muscle attachments allowing it to push up and out of the water.A NECK has appeared, along with muscle attachments for moving head side to side and up and down, and accompanied by cervical vertebrae. However, it has fins rather and no digitsand scales (the tetrapods have primarily skin). And perhaps the most telling transitional trait: Tiktaalik has both gills AND lungs. This animal likely could easily migrate from pools of water, although it's life is still primarily spent there. 

[**Ancanthostega**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/acanthostega.html) **(365 MYA)**

This animal was certainly spending some time outside of the water, although it would have been somewhat cumbersome. Digits are fully developed, but wrists still are not, thus, due to the wrist immobility, it likely still spent most time in the water and clung to plants with it’s “hands” Teeth remain labrynthodont and the skull is entirely tetrapod-like. Interestingly enough, there are eight digits on each limb not the five we've expect from tetrapods. But even with these odd hands, four limbs, each with digits, are present meaning this animal could likely move between pools of water. Gills are present still, along with lungs (as with lungfish).

[**Ichthyostega**](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/i/ichthyostega.html) **(365-360 MYA)**

Ichthyostega differs from Acanthostega in two primary ways: it's ribs and it's wrists. Ichthyostega's ribs are far more robust, and they overlap, meaning this animal would not have struggled under it's own weight while walking. It also has full mobile wrists, meaning it could traverse land far easier simply due to it's enhanced mobility. Interestingly enough, Ichthyostega has only *seven* digits per hand/foot, a step towards our standard of five.  The various fossils we have indicate it was more adept at terrestriality as a juvenile, returning to a primarily aquatic life as an adult, which would suit it just fine as it's gills are still present.

[**Tulerpeton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulerpeton) **(365-360 MYA)**

The seven toes diminish to six in this animal. It possesses all the land attributes which gave Ichthyostega an edge, and has lost it's gills. However, a new adaption give Tulerpeton an additional trick: it's neck and pectoral girdle aren't connected. This means it can lift it's head up and down rather than just side to side, allowing it to peek above the waters while obscuring the rest of it's body. A considerable hunting advantage. The plants it's fossils were found with indicate a brackish habitat where salinity and water level varied wildly. This paints a picture of a stealthy pool-hopper patrolling the deltas. 

From here, the various forms take off even more, specializing in odd ways for over 30 million years. And down the line we have a *clear* example of a ""typical"" tetrapod in:

[**Proterogyrinu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterogyrinus)**s (330 MYA)**

This enormous tetrapod (6-7 feet long) is likely not the first of the typical tetrapods, but it is a very well preserved example. A monstrous early tetrapod, Proterogyrinus is fully terrestrial, five-toed and squat with a flat, salamander-style head. It has a non-webbed tail dragging behind, true wrists and *five* digits, while being robust and able to move quickly on land 

So with the players in the lineage outlined, lets examine some of the additional facets of tetrapod evolution before diving into the criticisms. 

**Part 3: The Terrestrial Mystery Tour**

So why leave water in the first place? At a light glace, it seems like these animals had it made in the sea. But the water sported many dangers which likely pushed the sarcopterygians into the pegalic zones, coasts and deltas. Heavy set predators such as dunkleosteus lurked in the deep water, along with the continued reign of the sharks. Once in the shallows, it is likely these animals wandered into hybrid territories such as mangrove swamps or shallow deltas. 

Now, already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (similar to modern fish and amphibians, which often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests before migrating outward) these animals occupied two very different niches partially overlapped with one other. 

The land along the water thus became the less crowded, less dangerous option for those juveniles living nearby, and those species who could take advantage of it were rewarded with a directional selection for terrestriality. 

Those who ventured onto land also gained a new food source to take advantage of: the arthropods living there. 

Of course there are some enormous challenges to switching from the sea to the land (or vice versa). We covered already the skeletal changes which needed to occur, as well as the steps to breathing air exclusively (gills, gills AND lungs, lungs) but what about the chemistry of it? The nature of pulling O2 from water is very different from pulling it from the air. 

[The tetrapod evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_tetrapods) article on wikipedia has a nice summary: 

""In order for the lungs to allow gas exchange, the lungs first need to have gas in them. In modern tetrapods, three important breathing mechanisms are conserved from early ancestors, the first being a CO2/H+ detection system. In modern tetrapod breathing, the impulse to take a breath is triggered by a buildup of CO2 in the bloodstream and not a lack of O2. A similar CO2/H+ detection system is found in all [Osteichthyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteichthyes), which implies that the [last common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor) of all Osteichthyes had a need of this sort of detection system.

The second mechanism for a breath is a [surfactant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant) system in the lungs to facilitate gas exchange. This is also found in all Osteichthyes, even those that are almost entirely aquatic. The highly conserved nature of this system suggests that even aquatic Osteichthyes have some need for a surfactant system, which may seem strange as there is no gas underwater. The third mechanism for a breath is the actual motion of the breath. This mechanism predates the last common ancestor of Osteichthyes, as it can be observed in [*Lampetra camtshatica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey)*,* the [sister clade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_group) to Osteichthyes. 

In Lampreys, this mechanism takes the form of a ""cough"", where the lamprey shakes its body to allow water flow across its gills. When CO2 levels in the lamprey's blood climb too high, a signal is sent to a central pattern generator that causes the lamprey to ""cough"" and allow CO2 to leave its body. This linkage between the CO2 detection system and the central pattern generator is extremely similar to the linkage between these two systems in tetrapods, which implies homology.""

We can look into the genetics as well, covered a bit in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b5k9sv/the_evolution_of_the_inner_ear_or_the_zoo_in_you/) on the inner ear and the genetics involved. I will paste a portion below:

Fish have what is known as a Lateral Line along both sides to detect movement, vibration, and pressure gradients in the surrounding water. The Lateral Line is composed of neuromasts (small receptors with hair-like projections which extend into a jelly-like sac ). The Lateral Line pits are found in the fossils of ancient fish as well, dating back hundreds of millions of years ago. The Lateral Line formation is controlled by the gene known as *Pax 2*, and the **same exact gene** is responsible for the formation of the inner ear in **mammals** and the varying levels of auditory ability in **reptiles and amphibians (so all our tetrapods)**

The receptors for BOTH these taxa appears in [amphioxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelet) in the form of hair-like epithelial cells and connecting neurons. Coincidentally, this organism is thought to be the precursor for all chordates.

To put it all more plainly: same gene that controls the formation of the lateral line (detecting prey, orientation, schooling) controls the formation of the mammalian inner ear (modern balance/hearing organ) and the ancestor of BOTH has the genes for the receptor type's origin.

Can we go back any further though?

Box jellyfish are incredibly ""primitive"" animals. They have a sort of ancient eye (unique to sea jellies), but certainly lack any type of ear or lateral line.

What do their genes say? They don't have *Pax 2* (balance/hearing) OR *Pax 6* (sight) but have a single gene for their primitive eyes that is a genetic mosaic of BOTH *Pax 2* and *Pax 6.*

The implication here is that perhaps ancient cnidarians hold the key to the eventual duplication or point mutation that progenated *Pax 2* and *Pax 6* from the precursor mosaic.

So the genetics are in place by the time we reach the Sarcopterygians like Eusthenopteron, what about the physical form? The actual inner ear bones? Eusthenopteron's stapes is nearly in place, and by the time we meet the early amphibian Tulerpeton, the first inner ear bone is in place, although hearing would have been incredibly poor.

With this in mind, we essentially have directional selection and mutation taking advantage of open niches and the safety of a new habitat. Basically, Evolution working as is should. 

**Part 4: Examining the YEC Response** 

Up to bat is my personal go-to for YEC opinion: Answers in Genesis.

Thankfully there is an easily accessible article on their site, one originally posted in the Journal of Creation back in 2003. I was hoping that their primary page on the subject would be a bit more up to date, but we will analyze it anyways.

[Paul Garner, Bsc Environmental Science, is Skeptical](https://answersingenesis.org/fossils/transitional-fossils/fossil-record-of-early-tetrapods-major-evolutionary-transition/)

The very first thing you should notice is the date that this paper was written, 2003, is a year prior to the discovery of perhaps the most important fossil of tetrapod evolution: Tiktaalik (2004). And even with that piece missing, there is quite a bit of floundering going on in this article (pun). 

For instance, Garner presents a very misguided idea of what ""intermediate"" means in the context of a fossil form. Mind you, I have met very few Creationists (anecdotally) who will define what a transitional form would even look like. But here is what Garner has to say: 

"" Evolutionary theory might lead us to expect examples of intermediate *structures*, but there is nothing intermediate about, for example, the internal gills of *Acanthostega*, its lateral line system, or its limbs. They are fully developed and highly complex.""

I wish someone would inform Garner that his idea on Evolutionary theory is incorrect. Evolutionary Theory predicts small morphologic changes accumulating over time thanks to natural selection and mutation. This means **there will never be an intermediate species that is plagued by incumbent or lethal morphologies.** This patently goes ***against*** the entire idea. 

But let's check a more recent article shall we?

[David Menton at it Again(ton)](https://answersingenesis.org/missing-links/is-tiktaalik-evolutions-greatest-missing-link/)

Menton specifically covers tiktaalik here thankfully. But he doesn't go more than skin deep. Essentially Menton argues that tiktaalik is ""still a fish"" (something no one disputes) and that it couldn't walk on it's fins (which is a rather general statement). 

Of course as we covered it is likely that if tiktaalik did move from different bodies of water it would be quite cumbersome, but not impossible. Similar to how modern mudskippers get about.

Menton's argument here boils down to calling tiktaalik a fish and mentioning coelacanth and lungfish to support the idea that fish can do the things tiktaalik can do. He doesn't dare go more than surface level on skeletal changes in the lineage over time. 

But no AiG dive would be complete without the assertion that it's the *evolutionary assumption* that's the real problem. 

[Evolutionary Assumption = Bad](https://answersingenesis.org/missing-links/fish-to-tetrapod-missing-link-found/)

Here we see an unlisted author talk about Ventastega (not covered in this post). This is another transitional form somewhere between tiktaalik and terrestrial tetrapods. The article quotes the actual paper on the finding and rounds itself off with this: 

"" What the scientists in this study did not do, was examine alternative ideas about what *Ventastega* represents. For example, if we start from the Bible—that God created the earth and all animal kinds in six days about 6,000 years ago, then we would likely conclude that *Ventastega*, like *Tiktaalik*, represents both the amazing creativity and economy that God has used in the multitude of diverse designs He made. ""

Essentially, Ventastega doesn't support evolution so long as you start with a worldview that *already precludes evolution as a possibility.*

I don't think I need to go into why this is not science in any shape or form. Beginning with a conclusion is never good in the world of science, be it biology, chemistry or physics. 

**Part 5: TL;DR** 

Tetrapod evolution is well documented in the fossil record and tracks morphologic change from aquatic sarcopterygians to terrestrial tetrapods. Criticisms of these fossils are poor to non existent and can be summarized as a slander of evolutionary theory simply due to it's implications. Valid criticisms point out we still have much to learn about this lineage, particularly in the realm of biochemical change, but this is classified as a lack of evidence in a facet of a well documented biological trend rather than what would be required for a YEC alternative: **evidence to the contrary.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Limestone 101**

Most limestone is made of the [skeletons and shells](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/geologyOfBritain/limestoneLandscapes/whatIsLimestone/howFormed.html) of trillions upon trillions of marine microorganisms. Deposits can be hundreds or even thousands of meters thick. Approximately 1.5 x 10^(15) grams of calcium carbonate get deposited on the ocean floor annually \[[Poldervaart, 1955](https://earthref.org/cgi-bin/err-s3-download.cgi?database_name=err&amp;search_start=main&amp;cit_id=1691&amp;file_id=8053)\]. A deposition rate ten times as high for 5000 years before the Flood would *still* only account for less than 0.02% of limestone deposits.

10% of ALL sedimentary rock is limestone... of which [most is marine](http://people.ku.edu/~stalder/KS-limestone.html). Of the limestone that is NOT, the majority of that is from lakes and ALSO involves microfossils. The only kind that doesn't, is not referred to as limestone under scientific terms, and is formed in hot springs and in cave systems. Of the limestone bands that we have, every one I know of involves: [microfossils](http://geology.isu.edu/Alamo/rocks/limestone.php)

So to summarize so far: **Most rock is sedimentary rock. Of that sedimentary rock, 10% is limestone, and of that 10%, the majority is marine in nature. Marine limestone, to my knowledge, always contains microfossils and thus in the** ***best*** **case scenario (warm, calm waters) will have a depostion rate of 1.5 X 10****^(15)** **, far too slow to explain the layers we currently have (hundreds to thousands of meters thick).**

There are of course, additional problems regarding limestone. 

1. Limestone takes time to form into solid rock, even today. Thus, if all of it were deposited in a single year, the result would NOT be the great, jagged cliffsides of Dover and the Grand Canyon, but gentle sloping. This is due to limestone's slow hardening, which would not be solid by the time the Great Paleolake burst and carved the Grand Canyon as seen in Flood Geology to create said cliffs. Instead, the enormous limestone deposits would slouch pitifully under their own soggy weight until, like a child's paper mache project, they harden.
2. Limestone deposits can be distuinguished as freshwater and saltwater. Freshwater limestone contains *only* freshwater fossil organisms, and saltwater limestone contains *only* saltwater organisms. 
3. Limestone has a strange solubility trend. It is more soluble (dissolves more readily) in cold water. If the Fountains of the Deep were cold, all the lime should be in a single layer on top of all the rest, precipitating out as the water warmed. If the Fountains of the Deep were hot, than all limestone should be near the bottom in a large band, having not been taken up by the surrounding water. Either way, limestone *cannot* be interspersed between clay, silt and sand in these models.
4. Limestone is highly soluble in water as it is, so large bands of limestone cannot be explained by currents carrying deposits from elsewhere either. 
5. Limestone from slow-growing coral and fast-growing coral can be differentiated. As such, enormous coral reef colonies (6000+ years old) in existence *currently*, whose foundations are their calcified ancestors, cannot be explained away as fast-growing coral which proliferated after the flood.

**Limestone Episode V: YECs Strike Back**

Arguments and rebuttals

* [The CMI (Creation Ministries International) Paper](https://creation.com/grand-canyon-limestone-fast-or-slow-deposits)

This paper lists many statistics comparing Calcite (Grand Canyon Redwall) and Aragonite (""Modern Lime Muds"") in an effort to contrast them in such a way that suggests flood geology to be feasible. 

These comparisons are somewhat trivial, as they have nothing to do with the claim the article ends with: 

""There is ample evidence to indicate that the thick Canyon limestones were not formed as today’s lime muds are, by the ‘gentle rain of carbonates’ over long time-spans, but instead were formed by the transport of sediments by currents of flowing water.""

Interesting, but where are the sources? 

Because I can provide a source by *four Christian geologists* definitively remarking the opposite:

""No limestone has ever been documented to form from floodwater-either in a laboratory or from field obervations- not even in floods as massive as those forming the Channeled Scablands in Washington State. Quite simply, limestone is one type of rock that takes a long time to be deposited- much, much longer than the time span of a flood.""

Grand Canyon, Monument to an Ancient Earth (Hill, Davidson, Helble, Ranney)

Furthermore, their example of how ""Modern Lime Muds"" form is also *brazenly* incorrect. Calcite Limestone is forming [right now](https://geology.com/rocks/limestone.shtml), as you read this:

 ""One of these areas is the Bahamas Platform, located in the Atlantic Ocean about 100 miles southeast of southern Florida (see satellite image). There, abundant corals, shellfish, algae, and other organisms produce vast amounts of calcium carbonate skeletal debris that completely blankets the platform. This is producing an extensive limestone deposit.""

How do they think we got a precipitation rate in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

* [The Mudstone Flume Experiment](http://www.shale-mudstone-research-schieber.indiana.edu/mudflume-research.htm)

Similar to Schwietzer's work, the flume experiment at Indiana University has been grossly taken out of context. The experiment proved that sediments of a particular type can be deposited in moving water of a given velocity, created bedload floccules. 

The Creationist idea then, is that if mudstone can be deposited in rapidly moving water, why not limestone? 

[For one, mudstone is classified as entirely unique to limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock), given the former is a ""Mudrock"" and the latter is of ""Biochemical Origin"". This is akin to saying because Macaws have long lifespans, so do sparrows. 

They behave entirely unique to one another. 

But let's say for arguments sake, they behave exactly the same. Floccules are identifiable formations, and as such, all sedimentary rock should be *littered* with them. But they aren't. 

* AiG's Gary Parker and his [""Creation Facts of Life""](https://books.google.com/books?id=jFhCK3LzITgC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CLike+most+Americans,+I+was+mis-taught+in+grade+school+that+it+takes+millions+of+years+and+tremendous+heat+and+pressure+to+turn+sediments+(like+sand,+lime,+or+clay)+into+rock+(like+sandstone,+limestone,+or+shale).+We+all+know+better.+Concrete+is+just+artificial+rock.+Cement+companies+crush+rock,+separate+the+cementing+minerals+and+large+stones,+and+then+sell+it+to+you.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cvRhLTrFud&amp;sig=ACfU3U3JcTZI3qfln0NrUUwp8xmV3U20bg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV-rGQwtvhAhUPWa0KHUbnDkwQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CLike%20most%20Americans%2C%20I%20was%20mis-taught%20in%20grade%20school%20that%20it%20takes%20millions%20of%20years%20and%20tremendous%20heat%20and%20pressure%20to%20turn%20sediments%20(like%20sand%2C%20lime%2C%20or%20clay)%20into%20rock%20(like%20sandstone%2C%20limestone%2C%20or%20shale).%20We%20all%20know%20better.%20Concrete%20is%20just%20artificial%20rock.%20Cement%20companies%20crush%20rock%2C%20separate%20the%20cementing%20minerals%20and%20large%20stones%2C%20and%20then%20sell%20it%20to%20you.&amp;f=false)

 Parker can be quoted in his book with some opinions on limestone. Originally, this bit was on the AiG website, but I suppose they had the good sense to take it down for reasons that are about to become evident:

*“Like most Americans, I was mis-taught in grade school that it takes millions of years and tremendous heat and pressure to turn sediments (like sand, lime, or clay) into rock (like sandstone, limestone, or shale). We all know better. Concrete is just artificial rock. Cement companies crush rock, separate the cementing minerals and large stones, and then sell it to you. You add water to produce the chemical reaction (curing, not drying), and rock forms again—easily, naturally, and quickly, right before your very eyes. Indeed, you can make rock as a geology lab exercise, without using volcanic heat and pressure or waiting millions of years for the results. Time, heat, and pressure can and do alter the properties of rock (including “Flood rock”), but the initial formation of most rocks, like the setting of concrete, is quite rapid.”*

This is misleading. As already covered, limestone forms as a result of calcium carbonate, a compound that exists primarily in microscopic marine organisms, accumulating over long periods of time. For this to happen, these organisms must die and drift to the bottom of the sea. As we also already covered, limestone requires calm, warm waters to precipitate out. The Flood would have been anything but. Finally, let us assume for a moment that hypothetically limestone could be laid down during the flood. How would we explain vast swathes of limestone underneath existing rock layers? 

This fossil formation (all I could find on AiG regarding anything about limestone when I was initially searching) simply rebuffs and avoids the issue. It goes so far as to take concrete, a manmade use of the process of *hydration,* to explain the natural processes of three separate and vastly different rocks forming. Hydration requires dry material. So why is there thick lime on the bottom of all oceans if there was a global flood? If there is evidence supporting fast settling or lay down of these rocks, why not mention it? Because as covered above, no such example currently exists. 

* [ICR Grasping at Straws](https://www.icr.org/article/scientists-prove-limestone-can-form-quickly/)

In this article, ICR argues that because the minerals which make up limestone can form quickly, that means limestone can form quickly. No mention of deposition though, which is the entire issue for flood geology. Or how geologists can tell if limestone is organic (the vast majority) or inorganic (typically relegated to cave formations) and the organic kind requires... well... dead microorganisms which can not ""form quickly"". 

Aside from all that, does this argument sound familiar?

""If the parts can form for something, their final product can form!""

Is this not the exact argument that YEC's so consistently rail against... for abiogenesis? Considering the amino acids necessary for life *have* been proven to form naturally? 

Just food for thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Limestone's precipitation rate is far too slow for to give all the required layers for the Global Flood. In addition, limestone requires calm, warm water, and there is no current flood model to offer an explanation for why such fine particled minerals appear in layers *between* coarse sands and silts.",11,1555657196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bew86o/the_trouble_with_limestone_and_why_it_precludes_a/

This is due to our inherent desire to feel apart from nature as it's master, rather than acknowledge our original spot seated firmly in the middle of the Serengeti food chain. There is a humbling that must occur to see oneself in the ancient apes of yesterday, scraping about in the dust of the East African Rift Valley, and yet this past of ours it written in our very bones: from how we walk to how we talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following post will explore this journey from the first true hominid to ourselves, and examine why our evolution is irrefutable morphologically, paleontologically, genetically and archeologically. I will try my best not to romanticize, but this is a topic I am very passionate about so forgive me if I get a bit flowery.

&amp;#x200B;

First, let's quote our friends at Answers in Genesis to set the scene of Human Evolution denial before we attempt to prove it as a fact:

&amp;#x200B;

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

You can explore some of their ideas [here](https://answersingenesis.org/human-evolution/).

&amp;#x200B;

The path to humanity from the first mammal begins with the [plesiadapiforms](http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/primates.htm), specifically, a former resident of Montana named Purgatorius. The development of the Old world monkeys (Cercopothecoids) which led to apes will not be discussed as the topic of discourse is strictly from apes to humans, not old world monkeys. 

 The first relative, and the original perpetrator of habitual (occasional) bipedalism is found in the East African Rift, in what is today Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia. The East African Rift is the boundary between two tectonic plates that sprawl across Africa and India, which now separate the lush tropical rainforests of West Tanzania and the Congo from the flat Serengeti that dominates where our ancestors first climbed down from the trees out of necessity. So who were these ancestors? **There are some 17 species of well documented Hominids**. 20, if you count some of the less supported fossils.

**Part 2: The Players in the Game (Brain Cases in cm SQ)**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Early Hominids** 

**3 Genera**

Sahelanthropus

Orrorin

Ardipithicus (Kadabba and Ramidus)

**Highly variable**

Bipedal at least habitually (more than chimpanzees and bonobos)

Dentation microwear indicates frugivory and some omnivory

Mostly ape-like

&amp;#x200B;

[**Sahelanthropus tchadensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahelanthropus) **(7 MYA):** 

Brain case: 300-400

 Sahelanthropus tchadensis is one of the oldest known species in the human family tree. Walking upright may have helped this species survive in diverse habitats, including forests and grasslands, although it definitely spent time in the trees. 

This species had a combination of ape-like and human-like features:

 Ape-like features included a small brain (even slightly smaller than a chimpanzee’s), sloping face, very prominent browridges, and elongated skull.

Human-like features included small canine teeth, a short middle part of the face, and a spinal cord opening underneath the skull instead of towards the back as seen in non-bipedal apes. The spinal cord opening (foremen magnum) is what tells us this animal was at least partially bipedal, although it was likely cumbersome at times due to no in-line big toe! 

Found in Chad

[**Orrorin tugenensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orrorin) **(6 MYA)**

Brain Case: 300-400 

Living around 6 million years ago, Orrorin tugenensis is the one of the oldest early humans on our family tree. 

Individuals of this species were approximately the size of a chimpanzee and had small teeth with thick enamel, similar to modern humans.

 he most important fossil of this species is an upper femur, showing evidence of bone buildup typical of a biped - so Orrorin tugenensis individuals climbed trees but also probably walked upright with two legs on the ground similar to Sahelanthropus.

Orrorin is at the base of the human family tree, and has more ape-like features than human-like ones -- except that it walked upright on two legs when on the ground. 

Found in Tugen Hills, Kenya

[**Ardipithicus kadabba**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_kadabba) (5.8-5.2 MYA)

Brain Case: 300-400

Ardipithecus kadabba was bipedal (walked upright), probably similar in body and brain size to a modern chimpanzee, and had canines that resemble those in later hominins but that still project beyond the tooth row. 

One bone from the large toe has a broad, robust appearance, suggesting its use in bipedal push-off.

Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered 11 specimens from at least 5 individuals

Found in Middle Awash in Eithiopia 

[**Ardipithicus ramidus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardipithecus_ramidus) (4.4 MYA)

Brain Case: 350-400 

The foot bones in this skeleton indicate a divergent large toe combined with a rigid foot – it's still unclear what this means concerning bipedal behavior. The pelvis, reconstructed from a crushed specimen, is said to show adaptations that combine tree-climbing and bipedal activity.

The discoverers argue that the initial ‘Ardi’ skeleton reflects a human rather than a Pan ancestor as Ardi was not chimpanzee-like (bipedality, low sexual dimorphism and higher encephelization).

A good sample of canine teeth of this species indicates very little difference in size between males and females in this species. Ardi’s fossils were found alongside faunal remains indicating she lived in a wooded environment. 

Discovered in Middle Awash Eithiopia 

**The Australopiths (Savannah Bipeds)**

Likely gracile with larger overall size than chimpanzees.

Larger brain size (even accounting for overall size) than chimpanzees

Dentation is megadont and the palate is midway between human and chimpanzee in regard to parabolic shape. Molars getting larger.

Arms still longer than legs, foremen magnum continuing to move ventrally.

More bipedal than the ardipiths, but still some time in trees.

Thick tooth enamel (a human trait)

Still apelike development (rapid infant growth)

[**Australopithicus anamensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_anamensis) (4.2-3.9 MYA)

Complete enough brain case not found, brain cc unknown

Australopithecus anamensis has a combination of traits found in both apes and humans. 

The upper end of the tibia (shin bone) shows an expanded area of bone and a human-like orientation of the ankle joint, indicative of regular bipedal walking (support of body weight on one leg at the time). Long forearms and features of the wrist bones suggest these individuals probably climbed trees as well. 

Found in Kanapoi, Kenya

[**Australopithicus afarensis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_afarensis) (3.8-2.9 MYA)

450-500 cc brain

Au. afarensis had both ape and human characteristics: members of this species had apelike face proportions (a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw), and long, strong arms with curved fingers adapted for climbing trees. Despite climbing, big toe is almost completely in line, indicating frequent time on the ground as well. 

They also had small canine teeth like all other early humans, and a body that stood on two legs and regularly walked upright with a valgus knee similar to modern man.

Their adaptations for living both in the trees and on the ground helped them survive for almost a million years as climate and environments changed.

Remains from over 300 individuals have been found, and indicate heavy Sexual Dimorphism (perhaps in line with modern chimpanzees)

First found in Hadar, Eithiopia (Lucy)

[**Australopithicus africanus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_africanus) (3.3-2.1 MYA)

480-500 cc brain

Au. africanus was anatomically similar to Au. afarensis, with a combination of human-like and ape-like features. 

Compared to Au. afarensis, Au. africanus had a rounder cranium housing a larger brain and smaller teeth, but it also had some ape-like features including relatively long arms and a strongly sloping face that juts out from underneath the braincase with a pronounced jaw.  

Like Au. afarensis, the pelvis, femur (upper leg), and foot bones of Au. africanus indicate that it walked bipedally (valgus knee and inline big toe), but its shoulder and hand bones indicate they were also still well adapted for climbing. 

Found in Southern Africa (potentially a migratory branch of A. Afarensis)

&amp;#x200B;

**Our Paranthropine Cousins (The ""Robust"" Australopiths)**

Known as the “robust” Australopiths

Brain size slightly larger than their Australopith cousins

Huge megadont teeth (primarily molars) 

Massive zygomatics and sagittal crests in males

Despite being a cousin (and not direct relative) to us, the hominid trends continue: Bipedal (ventral FM), reduced canines, \^ brain, \^ size, almost inline big toe, valgus knee and bowl-trending pelvis.

Differences that make them likely cousins rather than relatives: HIGH sexual dimorphism (males were much larger), Huge zygomatics and sagittal crest, massive molars suggesting a heavily plant based diet. 

**Due to character restraints, the Paranthropines will not be covered in depth. There are three well known species, P. aeithiopicus, P. robustus and P. Boisei (2.7-1.2 MYA)**

They are fascinating though! Check them out and perhaps we can cover them in another post. 

&amp;#x200B;

[**Homo habilis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-habilis) (2.4-1.6 MYA) 

Brain case: 550-700

The first animal classified as genus Homo, rather than an australopithicine. It has reduced prognathism, smaller canines and a smaller brow ridge. It's small, like it's predecessors, but it's body ratio is trending towards human, although the arms are still ""too long"". It was certainly obligately bipedal, due to it's knees and ventral foremen magnum. H. habilis is found frequently with stone tools. Sexual dimorphism is shrinking again, and long species reign shows a broad range of encephilization. Ape like traits include brain case, face morphology (brow ridge and small s. crest still present, prognathism reduced but still accounted for).

[**Homo rudolfensis**](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-rudolfensis) (1.9-1.8 MYA)

Brain Case: 775

Considered unique from H. habilis, but only recently so. It has unique features not within species variety in the constraints of natural selection: ""larger braincase, longer face, and larger molar and premolar teeth. Due to the last two features, though, some scientists still wonder whether this species might better be considered an *Australopithecus*, although one with a large brain!"" If H. rudolfensis is a transitioning form of H habilis, it likely used tools as well although to my knowledge no direct tools have been found with it.

[**Homo georgicus**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) (1.7 MYA)

Brain Case: 600

 is somewhat controversial in it's ranking. It has a small braincase size for Homo and more ""old traits"": showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between [*Australopithecus*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus) and *Homo erectus*, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Tool use is observed both in finding tools with the specimens and cuts in animals bones found alongside specimens.

[**Homo ergaster**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster) (1.9-1.5 MYA)

Brain Case: 600-910

Also is controversial in it's ranking. It's high cranial diversity and occipital traits make it likely that H. eragaster is either a late transition of Homo erectus or is actually early representations of H. erectus itself. However,*H. ergaster* may be distinguished from *H. erectus* by its thinner skull-bones and lack of an obvious supraorbital foremen, and from *H. heidelbergensis* by its thinner bones, more protrusive face, and lower forehead. Tool use, just as the previous.

[**Homo erectus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) (1.8 MYA- 145,000) 

Braincase: 900-1000

One of the best represented fossils in many regards. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how many due to it's many subspecies and reputation as a highly variable species. It sports unique teeth from modern humans, as well as many cranial features (such as zygomatics). It's brain case is far smaller than even our smallest range for a normal phenotype, and yet, H. erectus settlements show fire use and more sophisticated tools than it's predecessors. This animal is found nearly all over, from Africa to Europe to Asia. It is likely it proliferated into the H. neanderthalensis (we have genetic hybrid bones) Denisovans and H. floresiensis.

And of course for reference, Us!

***Homo sapiens***: 300,000-present

Brain case: 1200-1350 cm SQ, 4-6 ft

Homo sapiens is known to have several traits which place it in genus homo, and a few which make it unique from the others also in it. Tall, lanky posture with enormous brains (focused on the frontal lobe) and advanced tool use. Anatomically modern humans can be classified by lighter build skeletons than their predecessors. Skull is thin-walled and high-vaulted with flat, near vertical foreheads. Reduced prognathism and brow ridges as well, small mandibles and teeth comparatively. Narrow hips support the most efficient biped hominid of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

The trend over all can be seen as so:

**Sahenanthropus, Orroren, Ardipiths**

\-bipedality develops

\-face morphology begins to change

\-bipedality becomes more efficient

**Australopiths**

\-encephilization begins to increase at a faster rate

\-face morphology changes to accommodate brain case

\-Pelvis morphology changes to accommodate brain case size during birth

**Homo**

\-Growth rates slow, and longer adolescence is seen

\-Brain case allows for development of frontal lobe 

\-Frontal Lobe development instigates tool use

\-Tool use eases life, allowing for culture

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a slightly more in depth look at the trends:

  

**- Bipedalism**

a) **How?** Reshaping of the pelvis, knee, ankle, foot and location of the foremen magnum.

b) **Why?** The reason for the journey out of the trees and onto the ground has been subject of dispute for decades. The current theory suggests that the East African Rift split separated a population of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees/Bonobos, leaving the latter in a flatter, less-forested Savanah and the former in the lush jungles. This forced the ancient hominids from the dwindling trees and onto the ground, where the grass was tall and seeing over it (to locate predators) was invaluable. We know they already *could* stand and walk bipedally (all great apes today *can* for periods of time) it became a matter of doing it often. Those who could, survived to reproduce and we see a trend of Bipedality. Additionally, this freed the hands for carrying young, bringing food back to a “home base” and later, tool use. 

\- **Brain size** 

a) **How?** Reducing prognathism and the size of teeth and expanding the brain case.

b) **Why?** Intelligence increases fitness! But then, why do we not see this in other species? We do see a trend for increasing “smarts” in some, such as cetaceans or the great apes, but upping intelligence takes mutation and an environment that selects for it heavily. It is difficult to see it evolve in a lifetime. 

**- Culture** 

a) **How?** Increasing intelligence and social relationship dependency.

b) **Why?** With intelligence comes empathy and existential questions. These three factors lead to the development of new innovations for survival (smarts), Helping the downtrodden members of the group (empathy) and the advent of burial and symbolism (existential questioning). 

**Other factors such as** 

\- Loss of hair: Humans are one of the most efficient animals in the world at avoiding overheating by dissipating it through sweat.

\- Speech: We sacrificed the ability to eat and breath at the same time for advanced vocal cords. Human babies’ larynx match adult chimpanzees until juvenile development.

\- Loss of Sexual Dimorphism: Human partition work more equally due to a more minute difference in the genders (5-11% dimorphic)

\- Dental adaption: Loss of canines and increased molars came with brain size increase, and the smaller teeth came to no detriment as we began to use tools.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3: We're All Damn Dirty Apes (Closing)**

“Clearly, there is nothing suggesting a transition between apes and humans. All we can see from the fossil record is either apes, or humans. Saying something is a human ancestor just because its an extinct “kind” of ape, doesn’t make something a human ancestor.”

Sorry Answers in Genesis. This is abjectly false. 

Human beings are bipedal, intelligent hominids that reign supreme on this Earth in regards to dominion over every other species. We are all encompassing on this planet and using our powerful brains and ability to hunt persistently we managed to rise from the grasslands of East Africa and become the formidable species the world sees today. **We are not just a part of nature, we are the very essence of it.** A perfect story of evolution yielding an unstoppable (not necessarily a good thing) force. 

Humans are animals. But what separates us from other organisms is our intelligence and our incredible empathy. Neither are totally unique to us, but no other animal sees it in the spades we do. Humans represent a beacon of emotion and passion and artistry. We create endless symphonies, sculpt mighty megaliths and write epic tales that wind through time and generations. We learned to navigate using the stars and reached every continent, and when the sea was sated we created planes to explore the sky. The gravity of our planet couldn’t even hold us back as humans journeyed into the stars and set foot on the moon above. We craft medicines and cure diseases, suck oil from the ground to power our cars, build towers that scrape the belly of the sky. Humans care deeply for one another, and for other species as well, domesticating animals that once hunted us for the sake of companionship. We stand apart in the Animal Kingdom as creatures forged in the dust of the Savanah and gifted with the spark of curiosity. We don’t learn so that we may survive, we survive so that we may learn more about this grand, extravagant world we roam. 

TL;DR Through the 17 + Hominids of the fossil record, we see morphologic trends that connect humans and our ancestors. These trends bind us to the animal kingdom and allow us to peer into our rich ancestry as we try to learn more about ourselves.

DebateEvolution,bdgi5m,IJustCouldntThinkOk,,t2_jo5nfvm,self.DebateEvolution,,Why the fall makes no sense.,"In this post I’m going to cover 3 points against the creationist argument of the fall:

1. The Law Of Infinite Probability.

The Law Of Infinite Probability states that if something can happen, given enough time, it will happen. This is a reason that the punishment is unjustified, if I didn’t want to grow a beard I wouldn’t grow one, but if I was immortal I (eventually) have to because I have infinite time for this event to trigger, but if I was unable to grow a beard, I wouldn’t grow one. Because we know Adam and Eve (according to the fruit) ate the fruit we know it’s possible therefore they (or one of their children) will have ate the fruit.

2. Free will.

According to most creationists we are the only living thing with free will (unless you include angels), this means that the serpent must have been following God’s will instead of its own, I know what you’re thinking; the serpent was Satan, the reason this argument doesn’t work is because the serpent is referred to as its own character, making the claim that it was Satan less likely “*Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made*. He said to the woman, ""Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?""” (Genesis 3:1). The only way you can disregard this argument would be to give animals credit of consciousness.

3. Right from wrong.

God gives Adam and Eve the only rule to follow (don’t eat from the tree of knowledge), however the Serpent told Adam and Eve they were not to be punished if they were to, instead that they would to be like God (knowing the difference between right and wrong). The fact Adam and Eve didn’t know right from wrong would be a reason they could trust the Serpent, Adam and Eve would not know the serpent was lying over God because they had no trust hierarchy (which would require knowledge between right and wrong) to tell who would be more likely to lie.",16,1555337908,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdgi5m/why_the_fall_makes_no_sense/
DebateEvolution,bdcgoz,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Transitional Species Handbook: Birds are the Definitively Living Descendants of a Lineage of Theropod Dinosaurs,"Let's talk about the little dinosaurs we see every day. 

The current near-universal consensus among paleontologists is that birds evolved from a group of dinosaurs known as Theropods. 

YEC website Answers in Genesis, [very much disagrees](https://answersingenesis.org/dinosaurs/feathers/did-dinosaurs-turn-into-birds/). This article was written by David Menton, who is not a paleontologist. He makes some very broad claims about the nature of our knowledge of bird evolution, most notably, that we do not have *any* feathered dinosaur fossils outside *Archaeopteryx lithographica, w*hich Menton insists is a true bird. 

In the following post, we will explore the dozens of transitional forms between ancient scaled theropods and modern birds, including A. lithographica, who is definitively **not** a ""true bird"" as Menton suggests. Near the end we will touch on the molecular evidence as well. 

**Part 1: The Recipes for Non-Avian Dinosaurs and Modern Birds**

In the realm of systematics, we have traits that classify organisms as one taxa or another. Below are the criteria of non-avian dinosaurs (in this case, theropods) and of Modern Birds. This is important to keep in mind as we examine the transitional forms because, as you will see, a neat line *cannot* be drawn to distinguish birds as a separate ""kind"" from their theropod ancestors. 

**Non-Avian Dinosaurs (Theropods)**

* Scales, or a mixture of feathers and scales
* Non-keeled sacrum, and non-flexible shoulder joints
* Unfused Pelvis
* Comparatively heavier bones
* Teeth
* Grounded (not capable of flight)
* Bony Tail
* Gastralia (Unique to Sphenodons and Crocodilians, a rib attachment site)

**Modern Birds**

* Feathers
* Keeled sacrum and flexible shoulder joints
* Fused Pelvis
* Hollow, lightweight bones
* Beaks without teeth 
* Primarily flight capable
* Pygostyle
* No Gastralia 

Thus the evolutionary lineage should roughly look like so: **non-feathered theropods &gt; feathered non-avian dinosaurs &gt; archaeopteryx &gt; transitional birds &gt; birds**

Let's dive in!

(Some listed are species, some are genera)

**Non-Feathered Theropod Likely Relative**

[Compsognathus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compsognathus) (Late Jurassic): Almost entirely like a “normal dinosaur”. Like most theropods (but NOT living birds) Compsoganthus had many classic traits: Bony tail, skull with teeth, gastralia, midway bird/saurian hip, no feathers and theropod vertebra. BUT this animal also had a **semilunate carpal (wrist)** which is only seen in bird relatives and modern birds. This bone is actually the primary bone necessary in the downward flight stroke in avians today. 

[Semilunate Carpal](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06042)

**Non-Avian Feathered Theropods** 

[Eosinopteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinopteryx) (Late Jurassic): Non-Flight capable, but covered in down with proto primary feathers on wing it also has a semilunate carpal but lacked any other modern characteristics.  Like most theropods, it had a non-fused pelvis and non-keeled sacrum but it is one of the first examples of feathers in theropods chronologically. 

[Anchiornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchiornis) (Late Jurassic): Potentially a Microraptor relative, due to the proto-wings on both arms and hind legs, which had **primary AND secondary feathers** but no barbules so no flight. The wing is a mosaic of traits of theropod arm and the wing seen in archaeopteryx lithographica. Semilunate carpal present. The first to have more lightweight bones comparative to it's size.

[Sinosauropteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinosauropteryx) (Early Cretaceous): Covered with a coat of simple filament-like  feathers whose coloration has actually been preserved in some specimens, indicating a reddish brown banded color for the animal. Excellent preservation has also shown this species has a more crocodilian-style respiratory system NOT as closely related to Archaeopteryx as some others to be covered, and is in fact likely a direct relative to compsognathus according to some paleontologists. Lightweight but not hollow bones and the ever present semilunate Carpal.

[Protarchaeopteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protarchaeopteryx) (Early Cretaceous): Well developed vane-style feathers from tail and a member of the oviraptors, (thus a step closer to Archaeopteryx). This animal had **hollow bones and emergence of wishbone** as well as the semilunate Carpal! NOT flight capable though, due to symmetrical feathering (modern birds with symmetrical feathers are not flight capable either, such as ostriches and emu.) 

[Sinorthosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinornithosaurus) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Feathers most similar to modern birds thus far: a down like covering over the entire body, with arms almost converted entirely to wings. However, not flight capable, as the wings only have the primary barbules, not the secondary. Full wings combined with hollow bones and semilunate carpal indicate gliding may have been possible and small size as well as fossil location indicates arboreal lifestyle. Micro-cell analysis agian gives pigment to feathers, giving the animal a yellow-brown-black color. Sinorthosaurus had a **wishbone and birdlike shoulder** semilunate carpal and the first to exhibit a **transitioning pelvis** (to fused).

[Caudipteryx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudipteryx) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Lineage of winged, feathered grounded dinosaurs with less advanced arm wings than Sinorthosaurus, however, primary feathers are arranged as in modern birds. ""Primitive"" body skeleton, but with hand and wrist transitioning towards archaeopteryx. Body is comparable to MODERN flightless birds with: uncinate rib processes,very few and reducing teeth, and a partially reversed first toe. Semilunate carpal and wishbone still present.

[Beipaiosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beipiaosaurus) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Largest “for-sure” feathered dinosaur found with more advanced down feathers, arm-feathers (not quite wings though) and tail plume feathers 4-7 inches long. Beipaiosaurus had a large skull, lightweight bones and transitioning pelvis as well as semilunate carpals and a wishbone. 

[Microraptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microraptor) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Four winged dinosaur likely capable of at least gliding and likely flight due to the wings and skeleton. **Primary and secondary flight feathers on large wings** just like modern birds, semilunate carpal, advanced **nearly perfectly modern bird shoulder, hollow and light bones.** Flight was likely somewhat cumbersome however, in comparison to modern birds due to a *not-QUITE* modern shoulder, disallowing full modern motion. Theropod traits still present: teeth, claws and bony tail as well as a non-fully keeled sacrum and a partially fused pelvis

[Zhenyuanlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhenyuanlong) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): The first to have a fused Sacrum (derived) but still has the unfused pelvis (primitive). Short arms (non-flight capable) but advanced wings, bringing questions as to the initial purpose of wings, and what may have driven their evolution. This species lack hindlimb feathers, has a semilunate carpal, wishbone, transitional pelvis and a tail that is analogous to *Archaeopteryx lithographica*. 

[Mei Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_long) (Early to Mid Cretaceous): Feathered with down covering the body and somewhat ""primitive"" wings. Famous for death during sleep, and it's fossilized posture is identical to modern birds: neck tucked under the wing. This behavior further links birds and theropods. Mei Long had teeth, a bony tail (with feathered end), and was certainly grounded due to small arms/wings.

**Archaeopteryx lithographica:** [The Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx)

This species is found in the Late Jurassic, notably earlier than some of these ""less derived"" theropods listed above. This is an excellent example of the branchy, bush-like nature of emerging adaptions in species. A trait may appear in several lineages and take entirely different directions. For instance, today the feathers in ostriches and emu are used for balance while running, not unlike Caudipteryx may have done. 

The post is illustrating the nature of *evolutionary trends.* We see many different iterations of feather types, wing types and skeletal posture, but the trend is still the same: **feathers initially evolved and persisted in theropod dinosaurs in a time period in which birds do not appear in the fossil record** (Late Jurassic, ""Modern Birds"" show up in the Cretaceous). These new adaptions try all sorts of things in varying forms, but inevitably trend towards the successful morphology seen in modern birds. 

So. What about Archaeopteryx. Is Menton correct? Is Archaeopteryx a ""true bird""?

**Absolutely not.** 

Let's do a trait check in shall we? 

**""True"" Theropod:**

* Bony tail 
* perforated skull with teeth
*  theropod vertebra and shoulders
*  gastralia (rib formations exclusive to dinos)
* A pelvis transitioning, but still more similar to that of a theropod 
* Theropod ankle with a short hallux

**Archaropteryx lithographica:**

* Bony tail is present but SHORT compared to all other theropods
* Teeth are present but un-serrated, unlike all other theropods, but skull is perforated and theropodian
* Big toe is fully reversed (Modern Birds)
* Wishbone, fused collarbone and modern bird shoulders
* Unique modern feather symmetry suggesting more even flight

**""True"" Birds:**

* Pygostyle instead of bony tail
* Non-perforated ""avian"" skull
* NO teeth (egg teeth are not actual teeth, and are developmentally unique from true teeth)
* Varying toe reversal
* Wishbone, fused collarbone and shoulders
* Modern feather symmetry 

Is it a transitional form? Or a ""True Bird""? Most certainly it is not the first species to wear feathers. Many theropods possessed these incredible structures prior to Archaeopteryx and some 50 species of decidedly non-avian dinosaurs had feathers (including the many mentioned).

**The reason Archaeopteryx is transitional is supported by it’s many mosaic traits that place it as more advanced than those previously mentioned but still primitive to modern birds.** 

But enough about the transitional form poster child, let's continue onward. 

**Transitional Birds: Denizens of the Mezozoic**

[Rahonavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahonavis) (Late Cretaceous): Indeterminate as to whether this animal is a member of avialae (birds) or a dromeosaurid, as arguments have been made for both. Still maintains many theropod traits including the tail, teeth, skull shape and some vertebral elements, but was certainly flight capable and had many of the derived traits as well (semilunate carpal, wishbones, fused skeletal elements etc). Some have proposed Rahonavis to be a relative of A. lithographica directly.

[Confuciornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confuciusornis)(Mid to Late Cretaceous): Most primitive bird relative to have a **beak**, however, skull was still predominantly theropodian in nature with nasals to the side of the snout etc.Although, the beak shape along with transitioning orbits are looking more modern. We see a pygostyle rather than bony tail but large claws tip the wings. 

[Sinornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinornis) (Mid to Late Cretaceous): More “advanced” than archaeopteryx in that it has a more modern bird-like pelvis, has teeth however, as well as clawed wings. Extremely modern skull lacking in most theropod perforations and capable of perching with modern bird derivations of the feet and legs. More modern blade-shaped shoulder blades as well, although we aren't quite at modern birds. 

[Ichthyornis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyornis) (Late Cretaceous): Most modern bird on the list so far. This animal has almost entirely modern bird traits, save the teeth it still possesses. Was likely a sea-faring bird who utilized it’s teeth in hunting given fossilized location. 

**And upon losing these small teeth, we arrive at modern birds.** 

Looking at the pictures of these fossils will reveal what Menton seems to have entirely ignored or simply not researched: Dozens of theropods have feathers and Archeopteryx lithographica is certainly NOT a true bird. 

But Menton has his reasons I suppose. While he *could not have possibly seen the fossils* (benefit of the doubt, lest we accuse him of flagrant dishonesty) he has a number of logistic problems in his proposal. Let's review and address them now. 

**Part 2: I know Why the Caged Archosaur Sings**

Alternative title: Menton's Lament(on)

&amp;#x200B;

1- **Birds are Endotherms, Dinosaurs are Ectotherms**

*""Seemingly forgotten in all the claims that birds are essentially dinosaurs (or at least that they evolved from dinosaurs) is the fact that dinosaurs are reptiles. There are many differences between birds and reptiles, including the fact that (with precious few exceptions) living reptiles are cold-blooded creatures, while birds and mammals are warm-blooded. Indeed, even compared to most mammals, birds have exceptionally high body temperatures resulting from a high metabolic rate."" -Menton*

When one bisects a theropod bone, they find that the bone is immensely more similar to mammalian (endotherm) and avian (endotherm) bone than it is to that of modern reptilian ectotherms! UCMP researchers have been working on dinosaur bone *histology* (the thin-sectioning of bone to see its structure). And their work suggests that dinosaur growth rates are far more consistent with those seen in endotherms.

[And more recent research](https://www.livescience.com/46293-dinosaurs-had-in-between-blood.html) seems to suggest most dinosaurs weren't ectothermic at all, but were actually mesoderms. Precisely what we would expect to see for an ""intermediate"" between birds and non-dinosaurian reptiles. 

2- **A Hugely Concerning Misnomer Misadventure ft. David Menton (and the AiG Gang)**

alternative title: Bird hip/Lizard hip

***""*** *All dinosaurs are divided into two major groups based on the structure of their hips (pelvic bones): the lizard-hipped dinosaurs (saurischians) and the bird-hipped dinosaurs (ornithiscians). The main difference between the two hip structures is that the pubic bone of the bird-hipped dinosaurs is directed toward the rear (as it is in birds) rather than entirely to the front (as it is in mammals and reptiles). But in most other respects, the bird-hipped dinosaurs, including such bizarre creatures as the armor-plated ankylosaurs and the horned ceratopsian dinosaurs, are even less bird-like than the lizard-hipped, bipedal dinosaurs such as the theropods. This point is rarely emphasized in popular accounts of dinosaur/bird evolution."" - Menton*

&amp;#x200B;

It is widely thought that birds evolved from Theropods, known “lizard-hipped” Dinos. This is a bit of a misnomer, and the answer to why lies in the ornithischians. “Bird” hips actually evolved twice, a concept called Convergent Evolution. So lizard-hipped theropods eventually diverged a group with functional bird hips, and simultaneously, ornithischians walked the earth with their own “bird” hips. 

Why does Menton not know this? Why does he assume that the initial bird-hipped dinosaurs evolved into birds, and a type into google would have cleared this up? 

&amp;#x200B;

3- **A Theropod in the Hand is worth Two in the Bush**

alternative title: The Digit Issue

*""One of the main lines of evidence cited by evolutionists for the evolution of birds from theropod dinosaurs is the three-fingered “hand” found in both birds and theropods. The problem is that recent studies have shown that there is a digital mismatch between birds and theropods. Most terrestrial vertebrates have an embryological development based on the five-fingered hand. In the case of birds and theropod dinosaurs, two of the five fingers are lost (or greatly reduced) and three are retained during development of the embryo. If birds evolved from theropods, one would expect the same three fingers to be retained in both birds and theropod dinosaurs, but such is not the case. Evidence shows that the fingers retained in theropod dinosaurs are fingers 1, 2, and 3 (the “thumb” is finger 1) while the fingers retained in birds are 2, 3, and 4"" -Menton*

This problem seems to be a bit of a semantic one as there is no ontogenical (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive. Basically, no one agrees because they aren’t even sure they’re talking about the same thing. Also this is not one of the main lines of evidence.

4- **David Menton versus the Respiratory System** 

  *""While fossils generally do not preserve soft tissue such as lungs, a very fine theropod dinosaur fossil (Sinosauropteryx) has been found in which the outline of the visceral cavity has been well preserved. The evidence clearly indicates that this theropod had lung and respiratory mechanics similar to that of a crocodile—not a bird.6 Specifically, there was evidence of a diaphragm-like muscle separating the lung from the liver, much as you see in modern crocodiles (birds lack a diaphragm). These observations suggest that this theropod was similar to an ectothermic reptile, not an endothermic bird."" -Menton*

 Sinosauropteryx is listed as an example to refute the avian lung/air sac appearance as well as flight, given it had feathers and small arms. But sinosauropteryx is a compsognathid, and not a true member of the bird lineage. It is an example belonging to the aforementioned group of non-avian dinosaurs which had feathers but never yielded birds. Additionally, Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor of Ohio University. In theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) flexible soft tissue air sacs likely pumped air through the stiff lungs, as is the case in birds. ""What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds"", O'Connor said 

5- **Feathered Folly** 

alternative title: David Menton pretends feathered dinosaurs don't exist and no one knows have feathers evolved

""Structures described as “protofeathers” in the dinosaur fossils Sinosauropteryx and Sinithosaurus are filamentous and sometimes have interlaced structures bearing no obvious resemblance to feathers. It now appears likely that these filaments (often referred to as “dino-fuzz”) are actually connective tissue fibers (collagen) found in the deep dermal layer of the skin. Feduccia laments that “the major and most worrying problem of the feathered dinosaur hypothesis is that the integumental structures have been homologized with avian feathers on the basis of anatomically and paleontologically unsound and misleading information.”

Firstly, see the above list to examine the numerous feathered dinosaurs Menton doesn't cover. And ALSO note something odd: Mention suggests Sinosauropteryx's feathers are simply collagen. But we can chemically examine these structures enough to *discern their color* using methods for *feathers, a structure made of keratin.* Collagen cannot be, for instance, red with brown bands, yellow or black. At least not any that I have seen. 

*""If birds evolved from dinosaurs or any other reptile, then feathers must have evolved from reptilian scales. Evolutionists are so confident that feathers evolved from scales that they often claim that feathers are very similar to scales. The popular Encarta computerized encyclopedia (1997) describes feathers as a “horny outgrowth of skin peculiar to the bird but similar in structure and origin to the scales of fish and reptiles.”12*

*In actual fact, feathers are profoundly different from scales in both their structure and growth. Feathers grow individually from tube-like follicles similar to hair follicles. Reptilian scales, on the other hand, are not individual follicular structures but rather comprise a continuous sheet on the surface of the body. Thus, while feathers grow and are shed individually (actually in symmetrically matched pairs!), scales grow and are shed as an entire sheet of skin.*

*The feather vane is made up of hundreds of barbs, each bearing hundreds of barbules interlocked with tiny hinged hooklets. This incredibly complex structure bears not the slightest resemblance to the relatively simple reptilian scale. Still, evolutionists continue to publish imaginative scenarios of how long-fringed reptile scales evolved by chance into feathers, but evidence of “sceathers” eludes them."" -Menton*

 As it turns out, the evolution of feathers from scales is not all that complicated. Essentially, elongated filaments appeared first on Theropods, followed by down and eventually body and flight feathers. This seems like a complicated process, but scales develop from a structure called placode. This structure, when “on” genetically, produces scales, but if “off” a ring of fast-growing cells on the top of the placode builds a cylindrical wall that becomes a bristle. We see in birds the bristle undergoes development and becomes a fully fledged feather66. But the point is that once a filament is evolved via scale mutation, feathers are not far off! This is very contradictory to Dr. Menton’s idea that the structures are vastly different, and yet this is a well founded and observable phenomenon. How so? Birds still have scales that remain “on” genetically on their legs! 

**Part 3: To Briefly Mention Mary Schwietzer** 

In all the hubub Creationists make about Schwietzer's work, they seem to ignore one of the major aspects of her findings regarding ""soft"" tissue in fossils. She discovered medullary bone in her female Tyrannosaur. This is was previously found ONLY in **modern gravid birds.** 

Once again linking even the most classically ""scalely"" theropods to the sparrow outside your window or the terrifying Canadian geese heckling you on your daily walk. 

**TL;DR**

Modern birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs, and both are considered archosaurs. This is known through the dozens of transitional forms, molecular data and behavioral similarities preserved taphonomically. 

Normally, I would list here how this could be refuted, but I don't really think it can be done in this instance. To refute this you would need to find direct evidence for Progressive Creation, and I am not exactly certain how that could even be done. 

Besides, rejecting such a  fine example of evolutionary lineage and molecular support is **for the birds anyways.**",6,1555306538,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bdcgoz/transitional_species_handbook_birds_are_the/

(long),"Let's talk about the major extinctions, shall we? Because they are quite problematic if you are a Young Earth Creationist.

In conventional science, there are typically 5 recognized Mass Extinction events. Extinction events can be defined as ""widespread and rapid decrease in the [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism). It occurs when the rate of [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction) increases with respect to the rate of [speciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation)."" ([Wikipedia, Extinction Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event))

These five extinctions events are written, saturnine, in the rocks. We can imagine a rich fossil shelf like the Burges Shale, immediately followed by a barren strip of sparse layering as biodiversity has plummeted. This is of course, what we find. Five times, actually, and each with additional identifiers that tell us part of the story of ""what happened"" to these organisms and their formerly flourishing ecosystems. 

Now, many Creationists have differing opinions on many different things. But one connecting factor (to my knowledge, a universal one in this ideology) is that **all of the rock layers and fossils above the Vishnu Schist (the lowest granite layer of the Grand Canyon) were deposited by the global Noachian Deluge which occurred somewhere between 4000 BCE and 2000 BCE in approximately one year's time.**(depending on the used YEC chronology).

What can be inferred then, is that the cause of death of nearly every fossil we find is impact from the wall of water or drowning. 

But the nature of how layers are deposited and the taphonomy behind the deaths of these organisms present issues, especially in the light of those found in death assemblages during mass extinction events. 

Let's tackle the glaring issues first.

**The Extinction Events: An Overview**

**1)** **Ordovician-Silurian**

&amp;#x200B;

**444 mya**, approx. 86% species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause**: a short, severe ice age that lowered sea levels, possibly triggered by the uplift of the Appalachians. The newly exposed silicate rock sucked CO2 out of the atmosphere, chilling the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we know this?**: Isotope analysis of Oxygen in [brachiopods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018297000631) and [conodonts](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5888/550) show us that this period experienced a serious cooling event! [It turns out](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/isotope.html) Isotopes can reveal climate. Similar to runaway greenhouse effects, this ""mini"" Ice Age entered into a feedback loop as more exposed silicate cooled the planet, freezing more water and exposing more silicate. 

**YEC Problems:** Isotope analysis alone is problematic for YEC site Answers in Genesis, which proposes a single Ice Age post-Flood. But logistically this is a problem for all YEC's. The organisms that died in the Ordovician Extinction littered the seafloor as they perished, supposedly representing the first to die in the Noachian Deluge en masse. But their own shell's isotopes indicate they died due to the ice that was beginning to creep down from the poles. 

Walt Brown, YEC producer of the Hydroplate Hypothesis, invokes supercritical fluids to explain the deposition of so many layers of rock. Supercritical fluids occur at HIGH temeratures, not the more chilled waters the millions upon millions of sordid shells indicate. 

Added is the obvious looming problem of ""ecologic sorting"". If habitat is to blame for the layering of the fossil record, why do we find ANY seafloor dwellers fossilized past this point? Why are the cetaceans and mosasaurs and MAJORITY of trilobites so much higher in the record?  

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Devonian-Carboniferous** 

&amp;#x200B;

**375** million years ago, 75% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** Colonization of land by plants allows roots to stir up the earth, releasing nutrients into the ocean. This might have triggered algal blooms which sucked oxygen out of the water, suffocating bottom dwellers like the trilobites.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we this?:** So vascular plants have risen to the land and doomed their distant eukaryotic brethren in the sea (including the poor trilobites). Sapping the oxygen from the sea, they created mass [anoxia](https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/5/3/pdf/gt9503.pdf) which can be seen int eh chemical analysis of laminated black shale and in the lack of free O2 in the sediment. 

**YEC Problems:** Anoxia is usually caused by algal blooms (due to eutrophic conditions) of organic-walled plankton and the like. Anoxic death in marine organisms is resultant from the lack of O2 in the water. There is **no means** by which to suggest that a flood can correlate or cause Anoxic Conditions, as the rough seas would *discourage* algal growth and destroy any land plants. The marine organisms should show cause of death linked to blunt force or burial, and the entire ocean would certainly not become anoxic in the conditions described in Genesis 6-7. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** **End of Permian** “The Great Dying”

**251 million years ago**, 96% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** A perfect storm of natural catastrophes. A cataclysmic eruption near Siberia blasted CO2 into the atmosphere. Methanogenic bacteria responded by belching out methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Global temperatures surged while oceans acidified and stagnated, belching poisonous hydrogen sulfide. “It set life back 300 million years,” Rocks after this period record no coral reefs or coal deposits.

**How do we Know This?:** Each of the factors are documented in the fossils and the rock and are abjectly not copacetic with a global deluge as the cause. First is the magma/igneous residue from the eruption of the [Siberian Traps](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9). We can track this also through the rapid introduction of isotopically light carbon found in the marine system. Second, we see the [anoxia](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04132) again. And finally is the fact that after these two events subside geochemically the biodiversity in the fossil record is absolutely decimated. Again, no ancient coral. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems:** Here we also see the death of the majority of the Synapsids, Dicynodonts, Pelycosaurs etc. These animals occupied the same niches the dinosaurs would come to takeover, meaning their habitats are the same and the fossils are in the same location but separated by geologic time. Some of these guys outwieghed some of the dinosaurs. So why are they so deep below them in the sediment? Hydrologic sorting cannot explain why a tyrannosaur would be above a gorgonopsid, as the former SHOULD sink below if they are indeed killed at the same time. And as I mentioned, their habitats are nearly identical, so Ecologic sorting cannot either. 

Equally as problematic is the notion of the anoxia (again) and the severe volcanism. You see, the noxious output by the Siberian Traps encouraged methanogenic bacteria to flourish. Today, modern methanophiles live in harsh conditions such as **under the permafrost or in the soil of arid deserts.** 

They do NOT thrive in floodwaters, or in a global inundation. 

The coral are problematic as well. After this geochemical marker in time, they dissapear and the taxa which are killed off never make a reappearance. However, they are succeeded in the SAME habitats by different coral (soft corals) which survived the Permian Event thanks to the lack of their calcareous parts. So the Flood Geologist must come up with a hydrologic sorting method which can model why the waters patterned the corals as such, since no modern floodwaters have been observed sorting SOME organisms by size/weight/habitat, and not others. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4) End of Triassic** 

&amp;#x200B;

**200 million years ago**, 80% of species lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Likely cause:** As of 2017, Volcanism is suggested, but this is a more contended issue. The disappearance of 80% of known life in the fossil record is abrupt and left few clues, but a 2017 paper examines one of the larger ones: Mercury.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we Know This?**: [Mercury Levels!](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/7929) These coincide with enormous volcanic events, suggesting another potential anoxic event. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems**: You may be noticing a pattern of anoxia here. Before you entertain the hypothesis that the flood triggered this O2 sap somehow and attribute it as another unifying Flood condition, allow me to present an issue. [The Geological history of Oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen) on the planet shows *fluctuations.* The most damning to this particular idea is the fact that insects enjoyed insanely high O2 numbers in the Carboniferous... which is seated between two periods of mass anoxia. 

The volcanistic nature of the End-Triassic is problematic due to the ash residue, which is **terrestrial** in nature. Meaning the volcanoes were not acting up underwater, but belching cinders into the air.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Cretaceous-Cenozoic**

**66 million years ago,** 76% of all species lost.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Likely cause:** Impact event that left the ) Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico. Killed all the dinosaurs, and all tetrapods over 55 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do we know This?**: [The Iridium Layer!](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X81900558) Iridium is an element that is *supremely rare* on Earth, but notably common in meteors and asteroids. There is a global band of this element found at the K-T boundary, the same layer that the Chixulub crater is found in. This layer is quite unique, as it represents a fuzzy border between the time of the dinosaurs and the time after them. This has always been the prevailing theory, but a [recent hubub](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died) has been made over supposed further confirmation thanks to a new dig site. 

&amp;#x200B;

**YEC Problems:** The nature of meteorite impacts is well known. We can tell by the size of a crater how large the object was, how fast it was going and it's composition. The crater at Chixulub is not indicative of a meteor which would have to penetrate sea levels higher than the Himalayas. 

There are arguments of course that the Himalayas are a *result* of the flood and perhaps the waters were lower at the time of the Chixulub impact. The question then becomes something a bit more problematic. 

The layers that make up the Jurassic and Cretaceous would have been laid down *late* in the Flood. This means The Chixulub impact was also late during the flood. Since we find the Jurassic dino fossils right underneath the Iridium Anomaly, we now face some issues. If the dinosaurs died this late in the flood, what did they eat while swimming for nearly a year? What about the dinosaurs not capable of swimming (looking at you carnotaurus)? if they were dead and simply not deposited yet, why are they all *articulated together?* Submergence in water lends a body to breakdown and the bones would be separately buried, not in a death-pose. 

Thus the dead dinos must have been *terrestrial* at the time of death. This final issue on the last extinction alone precludes the Global flood based solely on principles of Taphonomy, let alone in the light of everything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary + Closing**

While these events clearly create enormous problems for a Global Flood, little was said specifically on the Young Earth Nature. I am hopeful that seeing these events in tandem makes it clear that they could not have all occurred in 6000-10000 years simply due to the required ecologic recovery time. Additionally is the simple argument of [radiometric dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b8mcq2/radiometric_dating_is_wholly_and_demonstrably/) on the rocks formed during these time periods. 

The Mass Extinctions are incredibly displays of the fickle nature of our world.

Hey guys, first of all i am by no means an expert in theory of evolution but there was a guy i found who pointed out that evolution (not adaptation) is highly improbable and he argued that many scientists believe in it in a biased and ill informed way.

Here is what he told me (i will try my best to present his argument as accurately as possible):

First he started by saying the **improbability** of evolution happening from a purely stats point of view. He talked about probability of protein developing, and rants on about given the time scale of the universe and the ""primordial ancestor"" to form, the probability of that happening is very close to zero and that evolution makes no sense if it came from a common ancestor.

Second, he says that the way genetics work is that genes do not increase capacity size with each generation. If we start from a cell with a given genetic code, it does not evolve into something with more codes. it only evolves by changing its code or reducing it's coding size. Having said that, the only way for a common ancestor to make sense is that it should have began with an extremely complex code which statistically is very very small, again given the lifetime of the universe, will not make it possible even assuming that the proteins that form the gene does not degrade with time. If the ancestor started as a simple organism, then it is impossible for it to evolve to complex beings like what we see today since genes don't evolve from simple genes to complex ones.....yes, he ""ran"" the probability numbers and they are really really small for evolution as we know it to be true.

Thus he doesn't believe that evolution as we know it makes sense. He doesn't have his own explanation but he **entertains the idea that there was a prime mover** to start life (**God**). Yes, he is a Christian. He is knowledgeable in biology and (naturally) chemistry. I'm just a physics guy so I can't really refute his arguments. They do sound convincing though since I'm quite ignorant in biology (sorry). I suspect he may have misconceptions somewhere in his reasoning and maybe bias (my opinion). but then again, im hoping that there are some experts here to clear the air.

The guy and I chatted on a discord server where we (the community) talk about religion, atheism and other stuff. We'd be happy if you can give your two cents because that question was left hanging in the air for MANY weeks. Many christians there just rolled with him but some reject even adaptation (the guy doesn't). I though it's finally time to get to the truth. i dont mind if im wrong and he is right. what matters is that we learn stuff. PM me for the discord server link. Or write your answers here.

I'd really appreciate your inputs or your interest in debating directly with him in the discord server. not sure if it's appropriate to post the link here so pm me.

DebateEvolution,bagp3c,Ziggfried,I watch things evolve,t2_515go,self.DebateEvolution,,Ancestral protein reconstruction is proof of common descent and shows how mutable genes really are,"The genetic similarity of all life is the most apparent evidence of “common descent”.  The current creationist/design argument against this is “common design”, where different species have similar looking genes and genomes because they were designed for a common purpose and therefore not actually related.  So we have two explanations for the observation that all extant life looks very similar at the genetic level: species, and their genes, were either created out-of-the-blue, or they evolved from a now extinct ancestor.  

This makes an obvious prediction: either an ancestor existed or it didn’t.  If it didn’t, and life has only ever existed as the discrete species we see today (with only some wiggle within related species), then we shouldn’t be able to extrapolate back in time, given the ability.  Nothing existed before modern species, so any result should be meaningless.

Since I didn’t see any posts touch on this in the past, I thought I’d spend a bit of time explaining how this works, why common descent is required, and end with actual data.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is Ancestral Protein Reconstruction**
&amp;nbsp;

[Ancestral Protein Reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_sequence_reconstruction), or APR, is a method that allows us to infer an ancient gene or protein sequence based upon the sequences of living species.  This may sound complicated, but it’s actually pretty simple.  The crux of this method is shared vertical ancestry (species need to have descended from one another) and an understanding of their relatedness; if either is wrong it should give us a garbage protein.  This modified [figure](https://imgur.com/dNJCiFh) from this [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418793/) illustrates the basics of APR.

In the figure, we see in the upper left three blue protein sequences (e.g. proteins of living species) and, if evolution is true, there once existed an ancestor with a related protein at the blue circle and we want to determine the sequence of that ancestor.  Since all three share the amino acid A at position 1, we infer that the ancestor did as well.  Likewise, two of the three have an M at position 4, so M seems the most likely for that position and was simply lost in the one variant (which has V).  Because we only have three sequences, this could be wrong; the ancestor may have had a V at position 4 and was followed by two independent mutations to M in the two different lineages.  But because this requires more steps (two gains rather than a single loss), we say it’s less parsimonious and therefore less likely.  You then repeat this for all the positions in the peptide, and the result is the sequence by the blue circle.  If you now include the species in orange, you can similarly deduce the ancestor at the orange circle.  

This approach to APR, called maximum parsimony, is the simplest and easiest to understand.  Other more modern approaches are much more rigorous, but don’t change the overall principal (and don’t really matter for this debate).  For example maximum likelihood, a more common approach than parsimony, uses empirical data to add a probability each type of change.  This is because we know that certain amino acids are more likely to mutate to certain others.  But again, this only changes how you infer the sequence, and only matters if evolution is true.  Poor inference increases the likelihood of you generating a garbage sequence, so adjusting this only helps eliminate noise.  What is absolutely critical is the relationship between the extant species (i.e. the tree of the sequences in the cartoon) and ultimately having shared ancestry.

There are a number of great examples of this technique in action.  So it definitely works.  [Here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34594) is a reconstruction of a highly conserved transcription factor; and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095102/) the robustness of the method is tested.

&amp;nbsp;

**The problem for creation/ID**
&amp;nbsp;

In the lab, we then synthesize these ancestral protein sequences and test their function.  We can then compare them to the related proteins of living species.  So what does this mean for creationists/IDers?  Let’s go back to the blue and orange sequences and now assume that these were designed as-is, having never actually passed through an ancestral state.  What would this technique give us?  Could it result in functional proteins, like we observe?

The first problem is that the theory of “common design” doesn’t necessarily give us any kind of relatedness for these sequences.  Imagine having just the blue and orange sequences, no tree or context, and trying to organize them.  If out of order, the reconstructed protein will be a mess.  Yet it seems to work when we order sequences based upon inferred descent.  That’s the first problem.  

But let’s be generous and say that, somehow, “common design” can recapitulate the evolutionary tree.  The second, more challenging problem is explaining how and why this technique leads to functional, yet highly-divergent, proteins.  In the absence of evolution, the protein sequence uncovered should have no significance since it never existed in nature.  It would be just a random permutation of the extant sequences.  

Let’s look at this another way: imagine you have a small 181 amino acid protein and infer an ancestral sequence with 82 differences relative to known proteins (so ~45% divergence), you synthesize and test it, and low-and-behold it works!  (Note, this is a real example, see below.)  This sequence represents a single mutant protein among an absolutely enormous pool of all possible variants with 82 changes.  The only reason you landed on this one that works is because of evolutionary theory.  I fail to see any hope for “common design” here, especially if they believe (as they often insist) proteins are unable to handle drastic changes in sequence.

From the perspective of design, we chose a seemingly random sequence from an almost endless pool of possibilities, and it turned out to be functional just as evolution and common descent predicts.

&amp;nbsp;

**Protein reconstruction in action**
&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I thought I’d end with a great paper that illustrates all these points.  In [this](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10147) paper, they reconstruct several ancestors that span from yeast to animals.  Based upon sequence similarity alone, they predicted that the GKPID domain of the animal protein, which acts as a protein scaffold to orient microtubules during mitosis, evolved from an enzyme involved in nucleotide homeostasis.  Unlike the cartoon above, they aligned 224 broadly sampled proteins and inferred not one, but three ancestral sequences.  

The oldest reconstruction, Anc-gkdup, is at the split between these functions (scaffold vs. enzyme) and the other two (Anc-GK1PID and Anc-GK2PID) are along the branch leading to the animal-like scaffold.  Notably, these are very different from the extant proteins: according to Figure 1 S2, Anc-gkdup is only 63.4% identical to the yeast enzyme (its nearest relative) and Anc-GK1PID is only 55.9% identical to the fly scaffold (its nearest relative).  Unlike the cartoon above, these reconstructions look very different from the starting proteins.

When they tested these, they found some really cool things.  First, they found that Anc-gkdup is an active enzyme!  With a KM similar to the human enzyme and only a slightly reduced catalytic rate.  This confirms that the ancestral function of the protein was enzymatic.  Second, Anc-GK1PID which is along the lineage leading to a scaffold function, has no detectable enzymatic activity but is able to bind the scaffold partner proteins and is very effective at orienting the mitotic spindle.  So it is also functional!  The final reconstructed protein, Anc-GK2PID, behaved similarly, and confirms that this new scaffolding function had evolved very early on.

And finally, the real kicker experiment.  They next wanted to identify the molecular steps that were needed to evolve the scaffolding capacity from the ancestral enzyme.  Basically, exploring the interval between Anc-gkdup and Anc-GK1PID.  They first identified the sequence differences between these two reconstructions and introduced individual mutations into the more ancient Anc-gkdup to make it look more like Anc-GK1PID.  They found that either of two single mutations (s36P or f33S) in this ancestral protein was sufficient to convert it from an enzyme to a scaffold!

*This is the real power APR.*  We can learn a great deal about modern evolution by studying how historical proteins have changed and gained new functions over time.  It’s a bonus that it refutes “common design” and really only supports common descent.  

Anyway, I’d love to hear any counterarguments for how these results are compatible with anything other than common descent.

**TL;DR**  The creation/design argument against life’s shared ancestry is “common design”, the belief that species were designed as-is and that our genes only appear related.  The obvious prediction is that we either had ancestors or not.  If not, we shouldn’t be able to reconstruct functional ancestral proteins; such extrapolations from extant proteins should be non-functional and meaningless.  This is not what we see: reconstructions, unlike random sequences, can still be functional despite vast sequence differences.  This is incompatible with “common design” and only make sense in light of a shared ancestry.",25,1554646858,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bagp3c/ancestral_protein_reconstruction_is_proof_of/

Many natural phenomena that we have a rational, natural explanation for today were once attributed to the gods.  I don’t wish to belabour the point, but a few examples include [seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_personifications_of_seasons), yet hopefully everyone here accepts seasons are a result of the tilt of the earth. Weather events such as [thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thunder_gods) has also been attributed to gods.  We can continue this ad nauseam if you wish, but I think these two examples illustrate the point.

Science has reliably been shrinking our knowledge gaps without any evidence of a supernatural being that plays an active role in the universe. If we’d stopped trying to explain events back when seasons were attributed to gods, we would still be living in caves and certainly wouldn’t be debating over science that has essentially been solved for 150+ years. There is much left to learn about and discover, to me that’s infinitely more exciting / fascinating that ‘god did it’, so we can forget about problem X.

My question to the creationists, is how do you justify arguing that abiogenesis can be attributed to a god? I fail to see how this is not simply moving the goal posts of the rapidly shrinking god of the gaps argument. If a supernatural being interfered in the universe it stands to reason that we will never be able to understand what methods they used, so at what point do we cease scientific research, I assume not when humans still thought gods were responsible for the seasons.

To these ""geniuses"" (one of them has a flair saying he is a member of Mensa, most likely to overcompensate for his inability to show that he has any genius-like qualities in his posts), science does not deal in absolutes. This is not wishful thinking. This is an article that describes observations made, then tries to explain what those observations are, then tries to make a conclusion based on those observations. That's how these scientific articles work, and how they've been working for hundreds of years.

From Lyell to Darwin to Wallace to Watson and Crick, important papers and discoveries still had terms such as ""might have"", ""could have,"" ""maybe,"" even ""assume,"" as they were working toward proposing conclusions based on observations and not asserting that they had to be correct because they wanted to be. Not one of those scientists started with a preconceived notion and tried to force the conclusions, contrary to what creationists often do.

What science does that works so well, and that creationism constantly fails at, is that when these proposed conclusions are made, they can be **tested**. Others can take the work, do their own verification of the observations, and either reach the same conclusion or propose their own. And so far, much of that work since their time has shown that their underlying conclusions are very much true.

Creationists, stop doing yourself a disservice by trying to argue that a paper with maybes, could-haves, etc., means that it's just wishful thinking. It's how science operates: Scientists make observations, try to explain those observations, and propose a conclusion to fit those observations **without** just assuming that their conclusions must be correct.

""You can't know, you weren't there!"" This is an actual defense put forth by actual adults at the head of certain Young Earth Creationism websites. 

My minor in undergrad was Anthropology, primarily Bioanth (human evolution) but we had to take a fair bit of cultural anth. as well, and I chose to spend my time in an Egyptology Lecture. So much of my knowledge is based off of the textbook ""An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt"" by Bard, and ""A History of Ancient Egypt"" by Mieroop (from 2015 and 2010 respectively). 

So in this post we're going to examine how Egyptian Chronology is problematic for a literal Genesis interpretation, and also WHY we know the Chronology is sound. I am by no means an Egyptologist, but I am using sources written recently by very good ones, so if you have more in depth questions I would recommend checking them out. 

**Part 1: Egyptology 101**

Ancient Egypt is located where modern Egypt is today, in Northwest Africa hugging the Nile river. It can be separated into several time periods: Naqada 1-3 (Also known as the Predynastic Period), Old Kingdom, First Intermediate, Middle Kingdom, Second Intermediate, and the New Kingdom. 

We primarily care about the Predynastic Period and the Old Kingdom in this post, the reasons being the former begins the concept of Regnal years (how long a Pharaoh ruled) and the latter sees the building of the Pyramids of Giza. 

**Part 2: The Naqada Problem**

Radiocarbon dating is a double edged sword for many YEC's. On one hand, it can corroborate certain biblical events as well as the consistency of parts of the modern text. On the other hand, Naqada 1 begins in 4400 BC according to the multiple radiocarbon dates of fossil remains of humans and other animals, grains and reeds. This is outright problematic because using Lightfoot's age of 6000 years old, this enormous culture would be creating pottery, jewelry, their own religions, and trading with the equally large Nubia in a vacuum. 

It becomes more problematic when Naqada 3 rolls around with the advent of writing systems and Regnal Years with which to record history. These writing systems are the first hieroglyphs, and in conjunction with graphic narratives on palettes, they begin to record the first Kings. This will become more relevant in a moment. 

**Part 3: The Flood and the Pyramid Problem**

The Pyramids of Giza were *not* the first pyramids of Egypt. Human ingenuity is an incredible thing, but usually requires some trial and error. The first even remotely successful pyramid was built by the stubborn Pharaoh Sneferu (2613-2589 BC). He messed up several (leaving behind the odd-ball Bent Pyramid) before a success with the Red Pyramid (the first true Egyptian Pyramid) before his death. 

Sneferu was succeeded by three kings in a series, obsessed with pyramids. Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. Each built one of the Great Pyramids of Giza and filled them with goods for their afterlives. 

This means the three pyramids of Giza were all finished, along with the two other standing pyramids of Sneferu, the Sphinx and hundreds of Mastabas (large funerary monuments of past Kings) by the year **2490 BC at the latest.** 

These pyramids and monuments were covered with enormous, vain inscriptions of the Pharaohs who built them, including stone Steeles, cattle and grain counts and trade information. 

Answers in Genesis, a YEC websites, places Noah's flood in the year **2348 BC**. **This is 142 years AFTER the pyramids were built.** 

**This means the Egyptian monuments, which are today falling apart from time alone, survived a global deluge which was supposed to shift tectonic plates and form the entire current geologic record. These limestone monuments somehow avoided being buried under thousands of feet of sediment, and survive to today with zero water damage evident.**  

**Then, after said flood, Noah's kin repopulated, removed to Egypt and picked up** ***precisely*** **where the Egyptians had left off before perishing in the Global Flood.** 

They deciphered and learned the hieroglyphics, accepted the Egyptian Pantheon, picked up the Regnal Kings list where Menkaure left off, and *never ever mentioned a global deluge.* 

Of course, this is ridiculous. This is beyond impossible. So, AiG and others have decided not that Noah's Flood may have been localized or perhaps allegorical, but that Egyptian Chronology is *wrong.* 

Does this claim have any validity? Could Egyptian history be off enough to accommodate the YEC dates?

**Part 4: No, it couldn't. Egyptian Chronology is Solid.**

So let's entertain for a moment the possibility that Egyptian History begins after Noah's Flood. That Naqada 1 starts then. How is our population looking for those stats? 

Not Great, is the answer.

Assume human population doubling time as AiG does for many divergences from the flood which is a double of population every 20 years. Mind you, this is with NO MORTALITY and NO FAMINE, PLAGUE, WAR.

160 years after the Flood date AiG gives, Egypt was “founded” (2188 BC)… **with a total of 2048 people in the WORLD.** 

In 2234 BC, AiG says Babylon was founded. This is 114 years after the Flood. **The total WORLD population would be 512.**

**Under the occasionally used doubling rate, it is simply not possible given these WORLD populations are shared with: Sumerian, Assyrian, Akkadian, and Babylonian civilizations and any and all small traveling bands, tribes and budding societies. Additionally, numerous civilizations are dated to this time period around the GLOBE.** 

Not to mention if this is the population rate used, who is building these massive structures? There aren't enough hands. 

But back to the point: Egyptian Chronology is solid. Why? 

There are many reasons. 

First is the **Regnal years.** We can count back using King's Lists and figure out just how long each Pharaoh ruled for. Using this method, we arrive at ruling dates for the Sneferu and company which are THEN confirmed with radio carbon dating the organic material in the pyramids (namely, reed mats and wood).

**Secondly**, we can cross reference this with cattle censuses and festivals (such as the Sed festival or Apis Bull celebrations). These festivals are recorded in ceremonial papyrus writings, and the censuses are recorded as well, as a matter of bureaucracy. 

**Third, we can corroborate with OTHER nation chronologies.** If Babylon's king mentions Egypt's Pharaoh, and the regnal year counts for both indicate the same time period, we can be assured of the method and the Chronology. Egypt HAS this, in the form of the [Amarna Letters](https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/), diplomatic communications between the royalty of the Kingdoms of Mesopotamia  (Babylon, Hatti, Egypt, Mitanni and Assyria)

Fourth, is dendochronology corroboration. Using wood from Egyptian monuments and ships (Uluburan shipwreck, Sneferu's Cedar Ship) we can count rings back and obtain dates as well. 

Fifth is Radiocarbon Dating. This one is interesting, because Answers in Genesis is known for rejecting it as a dating method outside of the very recent. Interestingly enough, they have kindly given us a maximum for radiocarbon dating's efficiency and it's 5730 years. The vast majority of Egypt's history falls inside these constraints and supports **conventional Egyptian Chronology.** 

**Part 6: TL;DR**

The history of ancient Egypt is but a single example of archaeologic findings which present what I find to be insurmountable problems for Young Earth Creationism. Furthermore, to accept a global flood one must cling to a universally panned alternative chronology (with it's own insurmountable problems) or the idea that the pyramids could survive a flood without damage, and the people who resettled the location simply picked up where the former left off.

* **Radiometric Dating: An Overview**

Radiometric dating is not subjective in any sense. It is simply a method of determining precise dates based on the Physics principle that as time passes atoms of a particular chemical element will spontaneously change into atoms of a different chemical element. This is a firm law in physics: The **Radioactive Decay Law.** It additionally covers the nature of decay constants and half-lifes and indicates that to our current knowledge: **decay rates do not change in meaningful ways in nature on our planet.** 

Radiometric Dating can be done in a variety of ways and usually involves decay types: beta decay, alpha decay and electron capture.

* **YEC attempts to Discredit Radiometric Decay Rates.** 

The RATE team (an Institute for Creation Research group) was deployed specifically to refute this. And what they found is that decay rates cannot be changed in meaningful ways (that is, significant enough to propose 6000 years) on our planet.  

That RATE group has been discontinued since 2005, and in their book on their findings the group of YEC scientists **“admit that a young-earth position cannot be reconciled with the scientific data without assuming that exotic solutions will be discovered in the future. No known thermodynamic process could account for the required rate of heat removal nor is there any known way to protect organisms from radiation damage.”** 

Carl Wieland of AiG (Answers in Genesis, a YEC site) had this to say as well: "" When physicist Dr Russell Humphreys was still at Sandia National Laboratories (he now works full-time for ICR), he and Dr John Baumgardner (still with Los Alamos National Laboratory) were both convinced that they knew the direction in which to look for the definitive answer to the radiometric dating puzzle. \[new paragraph\] Others had tried—and for some, the search went on for a while in the early RATE days—to find the answer in geological processes. **But Drs Humphreys and Baumgardner realized that there were too many independent lines of evidence (the variety of elements used in ""standard"" radioisotope dating, mature uranium radiohalos, fission track dating and more) that indicated that huge amounts of radioactive decay had actually taken place.** It would be hard to imagine that geologic processes could explain all these. Rather, there was likely to be a single, unifying answer that concerned the nuclear decay processes themselves""

In all the history of radiometric dating, the maximum change in decay in a laboratory environment was 1.5%  in 1999 by altering environmental conditions chemically. ***To date, no evidence for perturbation in the decay constant of any geologically important radioactive isotope has been found.*** 

This has left a large problem for YEC's. Humphreys of the RATE team makes a *tacit admission* that the induced accelerated decay that has been experimentally performed (in elements not related to radiometric dating mind you) are ""minuscule compared to the million-fold or greater acceleration of decay rates which is required by the evidence for a young Earth"". He then suggests ""we should not be surprised if we find evidence that God has supernaturally intervened"". 

**So what we have here is the admission that without supernatural intervention the Earth's age appears to be ancient.** 

* **The Heat Problem for Accelerated Decay**

Let us for a moment grant Young Earth Creationism accelerated decay. What would happen if we were to compress 4.8 billion years of radioactive decay into 6000 years?

A Tufts University Geologist [did the math](http://chem.tufts.edu/science/geology/adam-eve_toast.htm)

At the time of Adam and Eve according to YECs, the **surface of the Earth would be 70,000 degrees C** for every square kilometer. At the time of Jesus's birth, assuming a generous geothermal gradient we would be at **400 degrees C** for every square kilometer. 

* Woodmorappe (YEC) and ""Fallacies"" 

John Woodmorappe has given some input on Radiometric Dating as well (although he does openly admit he doesn't at present have an answer for the ancient Bristlecone Pines). He has three fallacies which he uses to ""combat"" Radiometric dating methods. Let's review his fallacies here.

1. CDMBN or ""Credit Dating methods for frequent success, but Blame Nature for failures"" 

Woodmorappe seems to have this idea that geology is constant and without anomaly. He sees thousands upon thousands of correct and corroborated dates (through multiple methods) each year, but if a single date is strange and geologists remark that it may be a new phenomena it's suddenly fallacious. This is precisely what happens in Evolutionary Theory or Paleontology when a date changes. It's only okay in non-origin related science for change to occur. 

2.   ATM or ""Appeal to Marginalization""

Woodmorappe essentially repeats the first ""fallacy"" and notes that blaming anomalous circumstances is a cop out of sorts. He points to Rb-Sr dating (despite that this method has been largely abandoned for methods with less room for error, for example, SHRIMP for isotope analysis). He completely disregards the very nature of geology: to understand anomalies. Not to mention once anomalies are understood and accounted for, the margin or error shrinks.

3. ATT or ""Appeal to Technicalities"" 

Human error is not a factor in Woodmorappe's world. 

&amp;#x200B;

All three of these ""fallacies"" amount to one statement: ""If incorrect dates are obtained, even rarely, the method must be thrown out entirely.""

&amp;#x200B;

**On Discordant Dates**  


The crux of the argument from a YEC perspective appears to hinge on discordant dates. Four U-Pb methods can yield four dates, and may be unique from a K-Ar age obtained from the same rock. To them, this seems suspect at worst and faulty at best. And from a laymen perspective this is somewhat reasonable. But the simple truth is that these methods are not measuring the same event, and were not intended to do so. K-Ar in this case measures the cooling time of the particular crystalline sample, while the U-Pb or Sm-ND methods are measuring the ""whole-rock"" isocron. Thus these dates SHOULD be discordant. 

At worst, discordant ages suggest that geology could be understood more thoroughly and perhaps aren't as precise as we might wish. 

Occasionally (of the hundreds of thousands of tests) discordant dates have occurred that have not been understood. That is, we cannot readily attribute them to human error or known anomaly. This should grant YEC's little solace however, as almost invariably these dates are millions too billions of years old even in their discordancy. 

There has, to my knowledge and research, never been a rock body which has yielded a date in the millions and a date under 6000 years. They are almost invariably ALL ancient. 

Complaints notwithstanding, YEC's ignore the fact that concordant dates make up the vast majority of samples tested. Meteorites of iron and stone, individual or clustered and from all over the globe have been dated with Rb-Sr, Pb-Pb, Lu-Hf, Re-Os, Ar/Ar and EVERY kind of isochron and have ALL yielded dates of 4.4-4.6 billion years. 

Or consider the terrestrial samples. Here are the dates given by various methods for the Isue Greenstone Belt in Western Greenland on varying rock types in a sing;e location:

U-Pb and Rb-Sr : 3.66-3.77 billion years 

Sm-Nd: 3.74 billion years

Pb-Pb: 3.81 billion years

U-Pb and Pb-Pb: 3.70 billion years

You should see this and get the idea that this rock formation as a whole was probably completely formed around 3.7 billion years ago!

**Corroborated by other methods**

The rock dates using varying elements corroborate one another, but in addition to this they are ALSO matched up against Ice cores, dendochronology and ancient coral reefs. Here, they match as well.

Or perhaps we can look at how the movement of plate tectonics [match as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ayuvj4/radiometric_dating_is_corroborated_by_plate/)!

**Concerning Evolutionary Theory**

If we could not confirm the ancient age of the Earth, perhaps one could make the argument for ""Common Design"" when looking at the similar forms of connected lineages across the fossil record. But once the Earth can be definitively called old, ""Common Design"" falls meekly to ""Common Descent"". 

We see fossils of animals dated as having lived long ago with skeletal traits matching those appearing after it, perhaps slightly altered. The habitat can be confirmed as similar or different by the plant life, illuminating why an animal might have changed or remained similar morphologically. 

Traits that might have been ""Common Design"" become inherited traits, as seen in cetacean evolution.

Whale evolution begins with **Indohyus**, an artiodactyl from the early Eocene. Why is indohyus even relevant to cetacean evolution? After all, it has four limbs under the body, a rostral pair of nostrils, hooves, a short skull, conical tail, bulky shape and not much else. Except... it does have a unique trait: the involucrum, mentioned in the video. This is a bony middle ear structure which is today, UNIQUE to cetaceans and no other animal. Additionally, Indohyus has bone density similar to Hippos, the most genetically close relative to cetaceans in living organisms.

Next in the Eocene is **Pakicetus**. More wolf-like, Pakicetus has a narrower snout, and has lost the characteristic dental trait of mammals: specialization of the teeth, and a deducible dental formula. Instead, it has the conical teeth most carnivorous cetaceans have. Now this animal has webbed feet rather than hooves. How do we know it's related to indohyus? It has the **ARTIODACTYL KNEE**, complete with troclear hinges. This is stunning, because no carnivorous animal today HAS artiodactyl knees... but all cetaceans have the remnants of them. Pakicetus ALSO has the **involucrum.**It's bone chemistry suggests a freshwater lifestyle with excursions into, but not permanent living in, the water.

**Ambulocetus** arrives on the scene next, Mid-Eocene, and resembles a large mammalian crocodile. Bone analysis shows a delta-lifestyle with some time in saline and some in freshwater. It also has the **artiodactyl knee** and the **involucrum**, but unlike pakicetus, ambulocetus is beginning to grow sluggish on land. It's hindlimb structure is just not conducive to terrestrial locomotion.

Later in the Mid-Eocene we see **Rodhocetus.** Like it's predecessors, we AGAIN have the **involucrum** and the **artiodactyl knee**. This guy has a new cetacean-only trait in the making: four of it's sacral vertebra are partially fused. In cetaceans today, ALL the sacral vert. are fused. This animal has a bone density of saltwater exclusivity, and has nostrils beginning to move up dorsally. This is not surprising, as we now have the pressure to breathe without the effort a rostral nostril would require.

**Dorudon** in the mid-late Eocene is next. Still, **involucrum** and **artiodactyl knee.** Now the sacrum is fully fused as well, and the nostrils are MORE dorsal than before. Eyes have moved laterally (versus mammalian binocular vision) and some paleontologists have suggested the existence of tail flukes. Hind limbs are still ""useful"" in and of themselves, but gone are the webbed feet: it has flippers.

**Basilosaurus** is enormous and nearly a full cetacean. It has all of Dorudon's traits (including that i**nvolucrum and the artiodactyl knee**) as well as it's general streamlined shape. The blowhole is even more dorsal in comparison though, and the hind flippers are all but internal. The braincase is still somewhat small from the social cetaceans of today though. But for intents and purposes, this is a near-cetacean.

Modern cetaceans arrive soon after, along with Aetiocetus (the progenator of baleen). They have the **involucrum, artiodactyl knee** remnants, dorsal blowholes, streamlined shapes, internal hindlimbs and are entirely aquatic.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we are seeing is change in form over vast swatches of time. When seen in conjunction with the change in form** ***happening today*****, it becomes wholly evident that animals have always, are currently, and will always evolve.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing Thoughts and TL;DR**

Radiometric Dating has withstood immense scrutiny due to it's implications and has come out on top each and every time. It has proven itself, via basics laws in Physics, to be an accurate means of determining the age of rock (and thus our world) and is a very succinct means to deny YEC as a hypothesis. It also serves as a means to further confirm Evolutionary Theory, displaying ancient organisms changing form over time based on varying environmental change.

DebateEvolution,b6sa02,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationist Claim: Killifish have short life cycles and their eggs can survive in dry environments, are therefore evidence for creation.","[That's the claim.](https://answersingenesis.org/aquatic-animals/fish/rapidly-reproducing-killifish-defy-evolution/) 

That whole piece is worth reading to get the whole argument, but the abbreviated version is that these fish have two traits that are problematic for evolution:

1) They live in temporary environments (seasonally dry out), so they reproduce extremely rapidly (some reach sexual maturity in as little as two weeks). 

2) Their eggs can survive the drying and have been observed to stay viable for up to three years. 

The overall claim is that evolution is insufficient to explain these traits. Putting aside the problem of concluding ""therefore God did it"" without any evidence to that effects, let's examine whether these claims are actually a problem. The piece says:

&gt;evolutionists have no reasonable explanation.

You may be surprised to read that this...is not the case.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's start with the rapid life cycle. Time to sexual maturity is what's called a ""life history trait,"" which are things like lifespan, number of offspring, offspring per little, number of reproductive events, and...time to sexual maturity (among other things). 

Life history traits heritable, and are very sensitive to selective pressures imposed by ""extrinsic mortality,"" which are factors that cause early death, such as predation, disease, or the loss of one's habitat. 

One well-studied example is how the presence of the transmissible cancer called devil face tumor disease has affected the lifespan and speed of maturation of Tasmanian devils. Without the disease, they reproduce at about 24 months old. But the disease reduced the average lifespan to around 18 months. So they're extinct now, right? Nope. In affected populations, it now takes about 12 months to reach sexual maturity. 

Basically, the thing causing extrinsic mortality imposes directional selection for traits that promote reproduction before death. We can observe it in lots of species, including some nifty experiments with fish living in environments with and without predators. 

These particular fish are living under extremely strong selection for fast maturation. So only the alleles that allow for fast maturation persist. 

The authors of the linked piece argue this had to all be in place to survive in this environment at all, but let me tell you: That isn't true. All that was needed was variation, where some small fraction of the population reached maturity fast enough to not go extinct in this environment. It wouldn't need to be many. A similar dynamic played out in Australia a while back, when researchers tried to use a deadly virus to kill all the rabbits, because they were taking over. In the first year, over 98% of the rabbits died from the virus. Success, right? Nope. The survivors had inherent resistance, genetically, and all their offspring were also resistant. So within two or three years the population bounced back. 

Same deal here. Maybe only a small fraction of the population could mature anywhere near the time it now takes. But if that fraction could survive, selection could do its thing and push them faster and faster. 

So that's the rapid maturation side. Easily explained by high extrinsic mortality. Which we see. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next are the eggs resisting drying out. 

I don't know if the authors know this but...there are a lot of eggs that do that. I know *they* don't think amniotes evolved, but...amniotes evolved. If you read the [actual paper](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.2001.280.1.R123) on the mechanism of survival, you'll see that the authors found some very specific traits in the proteins in the envelope surrounding the the embryo that contribute to retaining moisture in dry environments. Traits that have to do with protein structures that, I don't know, might be the result of selection acting on genetic diversity in the alleles coding for those proteins? I'm not sure how much of this paper the AiG authors read, but they sure didn't seem to consider the very cool work done by those researchers, because they claim:

&gt;Killifish eggs have a yet-unknown mechanism in their plasma membranes that causes them, to dehydrate very slowly.

Which is, let's say, not a very informative characterization of the work I've just described. 

I'm going to leave it there, because when AiG says ""and nobody knows the mechanism for X"" and cites a paper where the authors figure out a bunch of how X works, we're set. No mechanism? The paper you cited explains most of what's going on. Do better, AiG.

&amp;nbsp;

So once again, we have a very confidence claim, this time from AiG, that doesn't hold up under scrutiny, at all. Such is life. ",50,1553829183,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b6sa02/creationist_claim_killifish_have_short_life/

[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190122114851.htm) goes into it a bit more:

&amp;#x200B;

""""The times of speciation we can now calculate on the basis of the new rate fit in much better with the speciation times we would expect from the dated fossils of human ancestors that we know of,"" explains Mikkel Heide Schierup from Aarhus University.

The reduction in the human mutation rate demonstrated in the study could also mean that we have to move our estimate for the split between Neanderthals and humans closer to the present.

Furthermore, the results could have an impact on conservation of the great apes. Christina Hvilsom from Copenhagen Zoo explains:

""All species of great apes are endangered in the wild. With more accurate dating of how populations have changed in relation to climate over time, we can get a picture of how species could cope with future climate change.""

The study ""Direct estimation of mutations in great apes reconciles phylogenetic dating"" has been published in *Nature Ecology and Evolution* and is a collaboration between researchers from Aarhus University, Copenhagen Zoo and Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.""

I find it particularly interesting that it could potentially move UP the emergence of Neanderthals and Archaic Humans from H. heidelbergensis. This is the first example to my knowledge, since the reduction of the Sahelanthropus split, that we have moved a speciation even UP in the hominid timeline. 

Of course another implication here is that if humans did **NOT** diverge from a branch of hominids leading back to S. tchadensis this is **incredibly coincidental.** It suggests that the mutation rates of the  Great Apes **simply appear** to corroborate the hominids. 

I suspect a potential argument might propose that this somehow separates humans and the great apes more given the differing mutation rates, but that effectively requires a line to be drawn in the hominid lineage. This means the proposer would need to classify all the ""muddles-in-the-middle"" so many Creationists avoid entirely.

On the surface, this seems flat-out impossible. Birds are an incredibly diverse group of creatures (we have ostriches, pigeons, vultures, hawks, shrikes, crossbills, parrots and ducks) living in a variety of locations (vultures soar over the African savannah, the Phillipine eagle hunts sloths in its rainforest home, and Darwin's finches run the gauntlet from seed-eating to insectivorous to vampiric). By comparison, crocs universally live near large bodies of water to keep themselves fed and cooled off and there's very little deviation with regard to their anatomy. The easiest crocodilian to differentiate from other crocs would be the gharial since its jaws are shaped like tweezers (male gharials have an oddly-shaped knob on the end of their snouts). 

The evolutionary explanation is that birds and crocodiles are part of the same clade (Archosauria - all dinosaurs and pterosaurs are also members of this clade) and evolved divergently from a common ancestor. This is supported by genetic evidence as per the linked article and the study within it. Do creationists have a counter-explanation for this that is testable and reproducible, per the requirements of the scientific method? I suspect not, but I'm willing to change my mind on this.

DebateEvolution,b5k9sv,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,"The Evolution of the Inner Ear (Or, the ""Zoo in You"")","The evolution of the auditory ossicles is a story that most think begins in the synapsids (early amniotes of the late Carboniferous, sometimes referred to as the ""Mammal-Like Reptiles""). We picture the classic dimetrodons lumbering about the early forests, it's anterior mandible beginning to separate and differentiate into what would become the mallus and the incus. 

These synapsids already had their stapes though, the most interior of the inner ear bones. When did this happen? How? What about the nature of hearing itself? 

We begin our story in the genes of our deep sea relatives. In order to swim ""upright"" and maintain position in the water, fish have what is known as a Lateral Line along both sides. The Lateral Line is composed of neuromasts (small receptors with hair-like projections which extend into a jelly-like sac ). The Lateral Line pits are found in the fossils of primitive fish as well, dating back hundreds of millions of years ago. The Lateral Line formation is controlled by the gene known as *Pax 2*, and the **same exact gene** is responsible for the formation of the inner ear in **mammals** and the varying stages of the prototypes in reptiles and amphibians. 

The receptors for BOTH these taxa appears in [amphioxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelet) in the form of hair-like neurons. Coincidentally, this organism is thought to be the precursor for all chordates.

To put it all more plainly: same gene that controls the formation of the lateral line (primitive balance organ) controls the formation of the mammalian inner ear (modern balance/hearing organ) and the ancestor of BOTH has the genes for the receptor type's origin. 

Can we go back any further though?

Box jellyfish are incredibly ""primitive"" animals. They have a sort of ancient eye (unique to sea jellies), but certainly lack any type of ear or lateral line. 

What do their genes say? They don't have *Pax 2* (balance/hearing) OR *Pax 6* (sight) but have a single gene for their primitive eyes that is a genetic mosaic of BOTH *Pax 2* and *Pax 6.* 

The implication here is that perhaps primitive cnidarians hold the key to the eventual duplication or point mutation that progenated *Pax 2* and *Pax 6* from the precursor mosaic. 

So the genetics are in place by the time we reach the Sarcopterygians like Eusthenopteron, what about the physical form? The actual inner ear bones? Eusthenopteron's stapes is nearly in place, and by the time we meet the primitive amphibian Tulerpeton, the first inner ear bone is in place and functional for terrestrial hearing and balance. 

The synapsids though, hold the key for the mallus and the incus. Through the following organisms (some species some genera) , we find the inner ear bones separating out from the ramus of the mandible and moving interior nearer to the stapes. **This is an evolutionary trend, meaning there aren't known synapsids, therapsids or cynodonts who violate this theme of separating and migrating ossicles ""primitive"" to the modern malus and incus.**

The author continues, addressing the idea of a partiathrinl tympanic membrane: "" ‘evolutionary optimization is not measured in absolute terms, but by its relation to contemporaneous and sympatric competitors, i.e. it must have been good enough for the Permian world’ (p. 316).

[Thrinaxodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrinaxodon): The articular bone (malus) is in or almost in position, and is the appropriate size. And in addition, we see the development of some of the outer ear as well, the tympanic membrane now being located inside the skull. "" The otic region is defined by the regions surrounding the temporal fenestrae. Most notable is evidence of a deep recess that is just anterior to the fenestra ovalis, containing evidence of smooth muscle interactions with the skull. Such smooth muscle interactions have been interpreted to be indicative of the tympanum and give the implications that this recess, in conjunction with the fenestra ovalis, outline the origin of the ear in *Thrinaxodon*. This is a new synapomorphy as this physiology had arisen in *Thrinaxodon* and had been conserved through late Cynodontia."" 

Furthermore, more information can be gleaned in relation to the location of the tympanic membrane, including the nature of what would become the muscles which allows mammals to move their ears about: "" The remainder of this pit opens to an ""un-ossified"" region which comes somewhat close to the cochlear recess, giving one the assumption that inner ear articulation occurred directly within this region.""

**Key Information Regarding  Thrinaxodon**

Thrinaxodon's skull looks very much like a modern mammal, the Kangaroo Rat, in the middle of it's embryological development, only to finish up as an adult with a modern mammal inner ear. This of course supports the notion that some aspects of embryology mirror evovlutionary history (at least in utero or newborn in marsupials). Fascinatingly enough, in the link below the squamate Agama lizard, newborn and adult Kangaroo-rats and Thrinaxodon are compared.

**Stapes and Malus In Modern Position**

[Cynognathus:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynognathus) With two ear bones in place, we are now watching the incus, which is properly diminished but still migrating. Additionally, this animal's mandibular joints are evolving as well. Generally reptiles have two jaw joints while mammals have one one. Cynognathus has two joints, like reptiles, but one of these joints is [mammalian](https://lflank.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/written-in-bone-cynognathus/) in nature!

[Yanucodon:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanoconodon) We now have one mammalian jaw joint, a nearly in place [incus](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fossil-reveals-ear-evolution-in-action/) and an in-place malus and stapes.

**Stapes, Malus and Incus in Modern Position**

[Eomaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eomaia)/[Sinodelphys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinodelphys): True mammals from the Early-Mid Cretaceous. Inner ear is fully functional! The former, Eomaia, is a placental mammal while the latter, Sinodelphys, is a marsupial suggesting the inner ear developed prior to the placental/marsupial split!  

&amp;#x200B;

The picture can be painted clearly: the genetics for function and the paleontology for form are easily traced through history and present day. The two show our relationship to all other animals, from box jellies to ancient synapsids. 

The study of the inner ear is, in my opinion, one of the most fascinating examples of evolution and it is all encased in the sides of our skulls by three tiny bones.

Problem 1:
How do you deal with the fact that simpler life forms (singe cell organisms) have less genomic data (sometimes 1000 times more). How can the simple life form be added 1000 times more base pairs in their genome. The cells cant even handle that amount of data.

Problem 2:
How do you deal with the probablity of life forming from the buildingblocks (amino acids nukleaic acids)? The problability has to be calculated in a way which imply that you take into accound the left and right handed stereomere of the amino acids, only the left one used. Giving you 40 different variables to form lets say a 200 amino acid protein without taking into acount the degradation of amino acids and the chance of it folding correctly. The chance would be 1/ (40^200). Even when counting the reaction rate to be in the miliseconds and use the entire earth, where each molecule is an amino acids would still give you a number that is in the 10^180 or something.

DebateEvolution,b4thuk,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,"ICR and their Fraudulent ""Living Tissue"" List","So I saw some recent posts at creationevolution on living tissues and their support for a young earth. I am very familiar with Mary Schwietzer's work with the Tyrannosaur and Hadrosaur framboids, but had not been informed that there were some other ""live tissues"" being proposed, most specifically, same Late-Cambrian and Early-Ordovician species (namely, chitin)

Fortunately someone went to the trouble of dissecting this list of varying ""live tissues"" and posting a play-by-play of their opinion on each, along with links to the papers/abstracts so others can read for themselves. 

[EyeonICR's Labors](https://eyeonicr.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/they-have-a-list/)

ICR's list is included at the top. 

Notable examples with my own observations include:

**""Shrimp Shell and Muscle"" est 360 mya**

And directly in the linked abstract the nature of these preserved *muscle striations* are covered:

"" The shrimp specimen is remarkably preserved; it has been phosphatized, and the muscles of the pleon have been preserved completely enough that discrete muscle bands are discernable. The cuticle of the cephalothorax is shattered into small fragments, whereas that of the pleon is absent except for the telson. Confirmation that this specimen represents a Devonian decapod documents only the second decapod taxon known from the Devonian and the third from the Paleozoic. It is the earliest known shrimp and one of the two oldest decapods, both from North America. ""

So, not quite live tissue.

**""Chitin and Chitin-Associated Protiens"" est 417 mya**

Chitin is formed by polysacharides and is found in the cell walls of fungi and in the exoskeletons of arthropods. This is certainly not analogous to ""live tissue"" in the sense that ICR is attempting to portray. Furthermore, the abstract clears up precisely the nature of this find: 

""Modification of this complex is evident via changes in organic functional groups. Both fossil cuticles contain considerable aliphatic carbon relative to modern cuticle. However, the concentration of vestigial chitin-protein complex is high, 59% and 53% in the fossil scorpion and eurypterid, respectively. Preservation of a high-nitrogen-content chitin-protein residue in organic arthropod cuticle likely depends on condensation of cuticle-derived fatty acids onto a structurally modified chitin-protein molecular scaffold, thus preserving the remnant chitin-protein complex and cuticle from degradation by microorganisms.""

So, not quite live tissue.

and a personal favorite of mine:

**""C-14 Date of a Mosasaur: 24,600 Years""**

To my knowledge, you cannot date an organism older than 40-50,000 years with C-14 **period.** 

And if you could, and were trying to get a Young Earth date, 24,600 isn't helping you very much anyways.

Let me know your thoughts, as I know the author of the blog was unsure of a few of their conclusions. But I think they did a pretty swell job considering the material they had to wade through.

What I am asking is, at some point in history there were no squirrels. At some later point, squirrels were running around. Where did the first ones come from? Is the Creationist answer that God decided to create a few squirrels in some corner of the forest? Would the answer be a Young Earth Creationist approach and say squirrels were created on the same day all the other animals were created?

I'm really curious as to how a Creationist would answer this question. It leads to some curious scientific questions. How often does a new species get created? How many of a species are 'created' without normal reproduction to allow for a viable species to take hold in an ecosystem?

I'm gonna grab a few of these that have been discussed at some length. Feel free to pick your favorite and go town.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of viruses. There was an excellent post about this recently. This shows the 7 genome types

Viruses aren't monophyletic, so it isn't as simple as figuring out ""the"" origin. [Some evolved from plasmids](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-112) (and we can see exactly [how this might occur in real time](http://www.virology.ws/2017/08/31/a-plasmid-on-the-road-to-becoming-a-virus/)), some [may have evolved from cellular life,](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/03/18/glimpses-of-the-fourth-domain/) or at least share a MRCA with cellular life. 

Have we figured them all out yet? No. ""Cannot"" be explained via evolution? Haha. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of tetrapods from fish. The structure of fish fins is nothing like a tetrapod limb. (See this for Tiktaalik limb)

Lobe-fins and modern tetrapod limbs [literally have the same major bones.](http://www.devoniantimes.org/opportunity/tetrapodsAnswer.html) The proportions are different, but aside from the most distal sets of bones, the major structures are all there and are developmentally and evolutionarily homologous. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of new organs like the eye. This might be solved by more research (doubtful), but right now the situation seems to be this: (i) line up all types of eyes from simplest to most complex, (ii) state that the simple ones evolved into complex ones. QED. (iii) Provide no details for which genes change, which new proteins need to arise and in which order this needs to happen. The amount of knowledge that is missing here is staggering.

We literally know the two major genes that needed to change in order for eyes to evolve, and exactly how they changed over time. The first group are [opsins,](http://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2011-2012/m2o1112/web/file_opsin_evolution.html) which evolved from g-protein coupled receptors that became photosensitive. 

The second are crystallins, found in the lens, which evolved from heat-shock proteins. [Here's one example.](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31176) 

To say we don't know which genes changed or which new proteins arose, one must ignore mountains of work on the subject, and also not use Google. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;How the different plumbing of the various reptilian hearts could have evolved without killing the reptiles.

I think we talked about this [before.](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/65xmgz/evolution_of_the_human_heart/) 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Splicosomes. These are complicated intricate molecular machines made up of many parts. This is one of the many examples of irreducible complexity that evolution can't explain. What's the point of the splicosome if there are no introns to remove? But if the introns came first, with no splicosome, then it would be fatal to the cell. We have to have introns (with all of the signalling information as to where they start and end) and splicosomes appearing simultaneously.

[Did that one,](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/68pg99/creationist_claim_biologists_cant_explain_the/) too. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Origin of new genes (?). I think that the only way that genes can occur in evolution is by gene duplication (since random changes are harmful).

&lt;Whispers&gt; Gene duplications *are* random changes. 

And also, most mutations are neutral, yes, that's a fact, and if you disagree, you better come with the data to back it up.

But like, of all the things on this list, new genes is maybe the easiest. Gene duplicates, one copy mutates, does a new thing. That's what happened with both opsins and crystallins above, for example. It's why we have two forms of hemoglobin, plus myoglobin. I thought this was supposed to be things evolutionion *cannot* explain. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, just wanted to cover some of the high notes there, since none of it is particularly new. 

I'll end with a question: Creationists, *how* does creation explain these features or systems? What's the *mechanism* through which they originate via creation? If we're going to hold evolution to that standard, the alternative will be held to the same standard.

DebateEvolution,b01xml,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Novel ""Irreducible"" Functionality in Lambda Phage WITHOUT Loss of Original Function","Lenski's having a back-and-forth with Behe about the latter's new cash cow, which I personally think is a waste of time since Behe has never seemed interested in anything like listening to critics...or learning...or not repeating the same tired crap virtually verbatim for coming up on three decades, but I digress.

Anyway, Lenski explains an experiment on a bacteriophage (Lambda phage) that demonstrates a clearcut case of 1) an ""irreducible"" biochemical trait evolving, and 2) a novel function evolving without the loss of the original function. 

My favorite example of such an evolutionary event is the evolution of tetherin antagonism in HIV-1 group M Vpu, but this will be number two on my list going forward. 

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's Lenski's explanation,
](https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2019/03/06/evolution-goes-viral-and-how-real-science-works/) which I'll summarize.

The short (and somewhat simplified) version is that Lambda uses a specific protein on the surface of it's host to inject its DNA, and it's never, in decades and decades of watching it evolve in the lab, evolved to use a different protein. 

But [this experiment](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC3306806&amp;blobtype=pdf) (pdf) resulted in a strain that uses a different protein to inject its DNA. Once they isolated that strain, they replicated the conditions and found the same trait over and over. In every case, four mutations were required to use the alternate receptor (two of which were always the same, and two of which could vary slightly). Anything less and the trait did not appear. They actually generated triple mutants to check that all four mutations were needed and showed that three of the four were insufficient. 

By Behe's own definition, this is an irreducible trait. But the researchers watched it evolve, over and over, 25 times in total, always requiring four mutations. 

That is a direct refutation of Behe's original creationist argument, as articulated in ""Darwin's Black Box"". The next finding directly contradicts his argument in ""Darwin Devolves"".

&amp;nbsp;

This second finding is that these strains, exhibiting a novel trait, retained the ability to use the original receptor. In fact, some of the mutations required for the new function *also improved the old function*. This is a direct refutation of Behe's newish (ish because he's been making this argument for as long as I can remember, but new in that it's the topic of the latest book) argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

So. Behe. Still wrong. 

And speaking for myself, this is a cool experiment that I hadn't read of before. ",102,1552355211,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/b01xml/novel_irreducible_functionality_in_lambda_phage/

This area is famous for it's impeccably rich fossil deposits, ranging from 310 mya to 80 mya, or approximately the Mid-Carboniferous to the Late Cretaceous. It's fossil record is most concentrated in the Permian and Triassic periods however, due to varying environmental factors. 

So why is this formation important? The Karoo formation was famously referenced by Whitcomb and Morris, the ancestors of all modern Flood Geologists, as being a dead ringer for a ""Fossil Graveyard"" created during the Great Biblical Flood. This is due to the estimated *800 billion fossils* thought to be present at the site. This number comes from the late  Robert E. Sloan, a Paleontologist who studied the formation under the University of Minnesota. 

The problem here is probably evident right off the bat. 800 billion organisms fossilized during the flood, as Whitcomb and Morris suggest, would be an impossible burden for an ecosystem; it is impossible. Dr.  Robert J. Schadewald did the math for us on this one: 

&amp;#x200B;

""A minute's work with a calculator shows that, if the *800 billion animals* in the Karoo formation could be resurrected, there would be *twenty-one of them for every acre of land on earth.* Suppose we assume (conservatively, I think) that the Karroo Formation contains *1 percent of the vertebrate \[land\] fossils on earth*. Then when the Flood began, there must have been at least **2100 living animals per acre, ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs.** To a noncreationist mind, that seems a bit crowded.""

&amp;#x200B;

So there appears to be a space problem. How do YEC's deal with this? I have seen a few different ways, so let's skim through them briefly. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The fossilized organisms didn't live there, they were simply buried there. (source: Various)

This is a problematic answer immediately, because even from a conventional standpoint in science we recognize there have been many large regional floods which have killed and fossilized a great deal of organisms (such as the [Washington Scablands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channeled_Scablands)). In these cases of massive flooding, or any event in which dead organisms are carried by water, we see massive jumbling events like those seen in [Dinosaur National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_National_Monument#The_Quarry). Essentially all the bones of all the carried dead vertebrates are brought together when the water calms (be it the subsidence of a flood or a bend in a river) where they decompose and their bones are fossilized in a large amalgamation of creatures. We DON'T see this at Karoo though, we see what we would expect from regular death events in a habitat conducive to fossilization. Taphonomy dictates it to be so.

* The unusually high density of animals per acre isn't a problem, we see it in ecosystems today! (source: [The Notorious A.I.G](https://answersingenesis.org/fossils/fossil-record/karoo-vertebrate-non-problem/))

If you check out the link (RIP your browser history) you should notice how defensive this article is. It is quick to point out that the 800 billion article is an estimate (and thus bad) but then state that even if it IS accurate, it's still not a problem because we see organism density at this level today. The admirable Dr. Woodmorappe (who, to his credit, admits bristlecone pines are problematic for YEC) notes 

""Simple studies of actual reptile population densities show that the requisite densities of reptiles not only are possible but do in fact exist even on today’s earth."" 

And proceeds to source his own paper on the subject, which is not readily available online to my knowledge (I couldn't find a pdf) The article does address the imminent criticism that you cannot apply small scale population density to a 400,000 square km area (implying whatever reptile population Woodmorappe references is indeed a small local one) but neglects to actually answer the question, invoking ""pre-flood world productivity maximums"". But given the Bible does not mention any pre-flood world ecology stats, this would qualify as ""Historical Science"" and is thus, invalid entirely. 

* Estimates are bad/The Estimate was a Lie (source: [Schadewald's conversation with the infamous Gish](https://ncse.com/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer))

Estimates are only bad when they apply to evolutionary theory it seems. Apply them to other areas of science and it becomes a-okay. As for lying, Gish is certainly one to talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize: The Karoo formation holds far too many fossils of varying organisms to suggest they all lived at the same time in the same, let alone in a stable super-ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a closing remark, it should be noted that the Karoo formation lacks marine fossils, bringing into question the nature of a flood which could carry 800 billion organisms to a single spot, and not pick up a single trilobite along the way.

DebateEvolution,ayuvj4,Gutsick_Gibbon,Hominid studying Hominids,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Radiometric Dating is Corroborated by Plate Tectonics (And thus proven accurate...yet again),"YEC's will often admit that radiometric dating can be accurate for a few thousand years, but tend to insist that it fails when applied to older rocks due to presuppositions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dates can only be reliable *if* 

* radioactive decay rates haven't changed
* the systems have remained closed
* the rocks were't overheated
* samples haven't been contaminated

&amp;#x200B;

And to them, that's a lot if ""ifs"". You can propose the fact that multiple dating methods agree, and they may respond that it is possible the decay rates have been slowing proportionally. You can propose coral reefs, dendochronology and ice cores, and they might wave these away as well with various statements on fast-growing reefs, double annual rings or corrupted ice samples. None of these excuses are valid, but anyone using these particular excuses won't care. 

So what other methods can we use to determine the accuracy of Radiometric dating? Well, for one there is an enormous heat problem when invoking faster decay: [A 70,000 C/km kind of problem actually](http://chem.tufts.edu/science/geology/adam-eve_toast.htm)

In conjunction with the [Oklo Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor) we know the rates have remained constant. 

But let's say for argument's sake that none of that is good enough either. This is when we can turn to Plate Tectonics. 

When we look at a map of the Atlantic seafloor, we can make out an enormous mountain ridge, the mid-Atlantic Ridge, which divides NA and SA from Europe and Africa. Magma wells up at this ridge, which is volcanic in nature, and adds new crust thus continuing the division of these continents and the expansion of the seafloor. 

Now, the ages of the rocks at the ocean crust tell a story. The closer to the ridge, the newer the igneous rock formed and thus the younger the rock. As we move outwards towards the continents on either side, the rocks get older with a maximum age of about 180 million years. 

We can measure the rate of separation of the continents by using the rock ages and the distance between the landmasses as well, yielding a rate of 1.2 in per year. Changing the location (perhaps we measure at varying longitudes) we get a range of 1.2 in to 1.7 in per year. 

**So how does this help us test Radiometric Dating?**

Satellite stations on each continent allow us to precisely measure distance movement, down to the scale of mere inches or less. Long-term measurement over the decades has given us a rate of movement around 1 inch per year, which is noticeably close to 1.2 inches per year: the rate determined by Radiometric Dating. 

Let's take a moment to think on these implications. Flood Geologists claim NA and Africa separated during Noah's Flood extremely rapidly, and that the rates have slowed to their current rate by some means. **For this to be the case, two entirely unrelated processes, plate movement and radioactive decay in isotopes, must have slowed down at precisely the same rate in order to give the** ***appearance*** **that the two corroborate one another.** 

Now from a science standpoint this is clear. But what about biblical? Can the literal reading of the bible justify God engaging in this kind of behavior? It would be very uncharacteristic. Romans 1:20 tells those who are religious that we can know God through Creation. If we can know Him through Creation, Creation is inherently not deceptive in nature. 

What this means, is that if nature says it is 4.8 billion years old, that it is in fact 4.8 billion years old. It also means that our fossils are old as well.",37,1552076716,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/ayuvj4/radiometric_dating_is_corroborated_by_plate/
DebateEvolution,aytjae,witchdoc86,,t2_ccp95,self.DebateEvolution,,Haymond's Formation and Dougherty Gap - Evidence for an Old Earth (And Cognitive Dissonance in YECers),"I recently posted Glenn Morton's argument that Haymond's Formation, which has 15 000 alternating layers of shale (with burrows) and sand. As per Glenn Morton,

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  The sands have several characteristic sedimentary features which are found on turbidite deposits. Turbidites are deep water deposits in which each sand layer is deposited in a brief period of time, by a submarine ""landslide"" (I am trying to avoid jargon here) and the shale covering it is deposited over a long period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""long time"" for shale is demonstrable by the fact that the shale layers contain burrows. One can see the burrows here

[http://web.archive.org/web/20100614072622/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/haymond.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100614072622/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/haymond.htm)

As Glenn points out, these burrows are clear evidence for an old earth - 

\&gt;  For the non-geologist who is reading this this means that the burrows are in the shales (which take a long time to be deposited) so the animals would have lots of time to dig their burrows. The sandstones are the catastrophic deposit which covers and fills in the burrows with sand. The fact that there are no burrows in the sand proves that the sand was deposited rapidly.

\&gt; I pointed out that if the all the sedimentary record had to be deposited in a year long flood of Noah, then given that the entire geologic column in this area is 5000 meters thick, and that the Haymond beds are 1300 m thick, 1300/5000\*365 days = 95 days for the Haymond beds to be deposited. Since there are 15,000 of these layers, then 15,000/95 days = 157 layers per day need to be deposited. The problem is that the animals which made the burrows mentioned above, need some time to re-colonize and re-burrow the shale. Is it really reasonable to believe that 157 times per day or 6.5 times per hour, for all the burrowers to be buried, killed, and a new group colonize above them for the process to be repeated? Even allowing for a daily cycle, would require 41 years for this deposit to be laid down.

&amp;#x200B;

/u/kanbei85 thought ""there was something fishy"" -

\&gt;  That is extremely old! Anyway, I cannot make anything out of those grainy photos. I really can't comment, but something's fishy about the fact that this claim has been around since 2003 and nobody's talked about it in the literature. 

He later supplied me with something he thought might be somewhat related to Haymond's Formation - 

\&gt; Further reply:

\&gt; Upon further examination, there is this old article from CRSQ back in the 90's; it's a bit technical in the geology department so I am having to carefully read it to make it out, but it would seem to be at least somewhat related to the issue you've brought up.

The article he supplied me was 

[https://creationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/crsq-1996-volume-32-number-4.pdf](https://creationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/crsq-1996-volume-32-number-4.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

 Incredibly, in it, he has supplied me with a SECOND example of strong evidence against a Global Flood!!! At Dougherty Gap!

&amp;#x200B;

If one turns to pages 207-209, we again have alternating sandstone and bioturbinated shale layers;

Page 207 figure 9 - they argue that the sand layers are not bioturbated

&gt;Figure 9. A Photograph showing the ""assymetric linguoid ripples"" described by Sheehan (1988). If bioturbination of the sandstone did occur as proposed then most of if not all of these ripples should have been obliterated following the deposition of the sands.

They also argue that the shale is bioturbated -

&gt;The reader will note that the tops of the shale units are interpreted by Sheehan (1988) \[and we agree\] as being both bioturbinated and having erosional surface.

Yet these bioturbinated shale layers are alternating with sand layers they argue are not!

These are over 40 layers of each.

Much thanks [/u/kanbei85](https://www.reddit.com/u/kanbei85)

Sandstone layer. Bioturbinated shale layer. Sandstone layer. Bioturbinated shale layer.

If you read the article further, they disagree with Sheehan (1988) about its age (because millions of years does not fit a young earth model) - and propose (because the Bible said so) it was all formed in less than a year from a catastrophic flood...

Page 209 details further how burrows were found not in the sand, but in the shale layers.

\&gt;   We never observed, nor did Sheehan document, the occurrence of lined burrows within any of the sandstone units. 

It also documents 

\&gt;  We view the sandstone sole casts as trace fossil structures which resulted due to scour-and-fill turbidite deposition associated with pre-event trace fossil associations (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6b). These sole casts were originally tracks and burrows made in the clay substrate (not sand as Sheehan has reported) which were partially eroded and filled with sand, thus forming sandstone sole casts 

Well. I am not a geologist/palaeontologist.

But - in a catastrophic flood model, how do alternating sand and bioturbinate shale (which has burrows) occur?

/u/kanbei85 has been so blinded, he argues

\&gt; The whole idea of strata being the result of millions of years of slow deposition has been debunked entirely by experimental science. You can watch layers form in real time as a result of mechanical sorting of particles by size, density, shape, etc. So whatever the nature of these so-called 'burrows', and whatever their cause, that does not by any means change the fact that we **know** that strata are formed by fast-moving (catastrophic) forces, not slow and gradual ones.

The piece he linked was from ICR, not the original paper though. Here I have linked the original, as I feel it contains much more information and does so as the researchers intended. I'm also not a fan of ICR, which likely comes as no surprise to anyone. 

 To summarize the pollen findings as I have interpreted them (from a comment I posted over there):

The pollen found in this Triassic period is not the same pollen as the kind we see from ""True'' Angiosperms. In the first article on this very topic we see the reference to these pollen-progenators as [primitive](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131001191811.htm) in nature. Is this not what we should expect from Evolutionary Theory? That complex angiospems must have a progenitor that was itself, a precursor? [This paleontology blog](http://paleoplant.blogspot.com/2013/10/fossil-pollen-place-angiosperms-in.html) further explores the nature of these primitive granules and compares them to modern ones, as well as the history if gymnosperm and angiosperm evolution.

In short, this seems to be science behaving as it should. It should also be noted that the dated of things seem to change almost exclusively in the ""older"" direction. This means we should be finding even *more* pollen that previously posited in flood rock. It also doesn't change my previous post: there is still no pollen in the Grand Canyon, because it is mid-Permian and before, as evolutionary theory states.

So, I retract my previous statement that pollen is found in only the Cretaceous, as we now know that angiosperms began development in the Triassic. It is of no consequence to my notions on the Grand Canyon however.",17,1551821738,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/axqk2u/my_mistake_pollen_has_been_found_in_the_triassic/
DebateEvolution,axhegf,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Fossil Evidence outside Transitional Forms which support Evolutionary Theory and the Antiquity of Earth,"I'm drumming up a document for my monthly coffee with a YEC chum and he challenged me to show some paleontologic evidence outside of my usual racket of pushing the transitions. 

Much of my information was gleaned from ""Grand Canyon: Monument to an Ancient Earth"" which is a sort of case study on geology and paleontology in the Grand Canyon. It's a book written by both Theistic Evolutionists and purely secular scientists, and contains some absolutely killer diagrams and photographs to illustrate their point. I recommend it highly to anyone even slightly interested in geology and GC paleontology. 

Much of my discussion surrounds supporting Evolutionary Theory and rejecting a Global Flood simultaneously. 

So my paleontologic evidence. 

* Fossil organisation

Fossils are organized according to evolutionary theory in regards to complexity. The typical riot with this point boils down to pointing out various layers *never* hold organisms that would not have existed during that time, but should, if we are considering a global flood depositing these many layers. 

The Tonto formation of the Grand Canyon for example, contains over 47 species of trilobite, but not a single jawless fish. Similarly, there aren't any fossils of anything existing outside the Paleozoic in the Grand Canyon: period. 

But more importantly are the fossils of the Grand Canyon Supergroup. This is a basement layer of the Grand Canyon, and it considered pre-flood rock. And yet it is covered in stromatolite fossils. This rock is usually posited as pre-flood rock because it cannot form rapidly. Ever. Most YEC's will admit this, and relegate it to rock having been created as-is, ex nihilo. However, this rock with dead organisms in it, exists as a part of the perfect creation pre-fall and pre-flood? 

In evolutionary theory this is what is to be expected. Archean fossils occur in ancient archean rock. Similar to the cyanobacterial fossils found in superdeep boreholes, the deeper we go the less complex we tend to get.

* The Freshwater Fish Problem

We find lakes which are posited as ""post flood"" in nature with freshwater fish fossils in them. Most freshwater fish die within minutes of being submerged in saltwater. If we are working from a flood angle, there should be no freshwater fish at all today or a hyper-evolution can be invoked. 

According to Evolutionary Theory these areas should contain freshwater fish similar to the ones we see today in overall composition, but not the precise species. This is what we find. Never has an identical organism been found in ancient rock. Even the Devonian coelacanth was a different species from the ones we have today.

* The Pollen Problem

Angiosperms cam around during the Cretaceous in the evolutionary timeline. As such, most fossil-rich rock contains microfossils of pollen, so long as it is post Cretaceous. However, as previously mentioned the Grand Canyon is only Paleozoic (it ends mid-Permian I believe) so we should not expect to find pollen. And we don't. In the event of a global flood, pollen would be easily found in fossil layers *everywhere* given all angiosperms would be submerged. These particles would mix with the sediment and be in nearly every layer. But we only find it with Cretaceous and above, according to Evolutionary Theory. 

Additionally, to confirm our hypothesis further, we should only find pollinating insects and animals in layers of the Cretaceous and above. Disprove this by providing a bee or hummingbird from the Carboniferous. 

* The Corals and the Crinoids

Enormous coral bed fossils exist in the Grand Canyon. Primitive species in low levels and more modern species high up. These species belong to BOTH the fast and slow growing species, meaning the slow-growers require thousands upon thousands of years to reach their size at fossilization. 

Crinoids are frond-like marine mammals and are very fragile. In many places in the western states of the USA, nearly pure layers of crinoid fossils exist up to 500 feet thick. These crinoids are primitive in nature and occur in the Redwall limestone of the Grand canyon. To explain these ridiculously thick layers of slow-growing colony animals (thickness is gained through succession, similar to modern reefs) Flood Geology must invoke the idea of multiple colonies of crinoids being washed together into a single location and fossilized. Did I emphasize how fragile these animals are? Or how many of these layers contain thousands of intact crinoids?

* Footprints in Flood layers

Foodprints matching tetrapod locomotion have been found in Coconino, Supai and Hermit groups. These are separate layers on top of one another, and the prints do not indicate any sort of escape-hypothesis. Even if they did, these gentle tracks are preserved in three successive layers which were deposited LATE in the flood. So somehow, tetrapods survived to the end of the flood in the water, and then in three separate layers gently strolled along the depositing sediment only to be killed, buried with their tracks, and for the subsequent tetrapod to do the same in the next layer all while a catastrophic flood is depositing layers which should take millions of years to form?

In Evolutionary theory this is because these areas were arid at the time the tracks were made by these potentially reptilian tetrapods and due to the slow locomotion (close together prints) and dragging tail, they were likely in no hurry.

* Fossil articulation

Fossils found in enormous floods end up dis-articulated and jumbled together with other animals killed in the event. Yet the majority of fossils we find globally are shown to have been killed and buried by more instantaneous processes such as mudslides, volcanism, bog/tar traps and other quick deposition activity such as more minor local floods. Known large flooding events leave organisms torn apart and scattered amongst a collage of other unlucky victims. 

From an evolutionary perspective, taphonomy dictates a tendency of quick burial and slow mineralization. 

* DNA viability

DNA samples are more viable in more recently deceased specimens. This is why we have Neanderthal and Mastadon DNA, and none from any eusthenopterons. Before you quote Mary Schwietzer's T. Rex and Hadrosaur, remember that if the world is 6000 years old these animals should have GOBS of genetic material in them, not some framboids.

DebateEvolution,ax8xpu,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"Let's have a lesson on transmissible cancers and how they behave as evolutionary theory predicts, shall we?","Transmissible cancers are a thing. Not cancers that are caused by a virus, but actual transmissible cancers, where the cancer cells themselves transmit horizontally between individuals. There are only a few known examples: Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) in dogs, devil face tumor disease (DFTD) in Tasmanian devils, one in rodents (gerbils, maybe?) and I think one in molluscs, and that's it. 

&amp;nbsp;

The evolutionary dynamics of cancers are funky. Basically, as a multicellular organism, all of your cells are working together, but also competing with each other for space and resources. Genotypes that promote cancer are selected *for* in the context of this population of cells since they provide a competitive advantage - more bloodflow, faster growth, etc. In effect, the cancer acts as a parasite, with one important distinction: The vast majority of the time, cancers cannot transmit to a new host. 

This means their evolution is driven by intrahost competition, i.e. competition with the other cells of the body. This is directional selection for more and more ""aggressive"" cancer phenotypes, which is how cancer usually plays out. Importantly, this is an evolutionary dead end; the host dies, and that's the end of the line for the cancer. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you add in transmission to other host, we would predict different dynamics. Transmission introduces a different and often antagonistic selective pressure, *inter*host competition. This is competition between the cancer cells in a single individuals and the cells *of other individuals*. This is a tradeoff that all parasites, from viruses to tapeworms, have to balance. Get ""too good"" at intrahost competition, and you kill your host without transmitting. Go to far the other way and you readily transmit, but your host's immune system defeats you. 

We see the solution in parasites: Host morbidity (i.e. parasites harm the host...), but not host *mortality* (...but do not kill the host). This is what we expect to see when cancers become transmissible. 

Does that prediction hold?

&amp;nbsp;

CTVT is old. It's been around since before the dog/wolf divergence. So it has been subject to these antagonistic selective pressures for upwards of ten thousand years. And...it's temporary and nonfatal. The tumors grow, and then go away, possibly transmitting in between. 

DFTD is recent. It first appeared, IIRC, in the 90s. And it had a 100% mortality rate, since the interhost competition hadn't really driven its evolution. For a while, it looked like it might drive Tasmanian devils to extinction. 

But now, there are a handful of populations that are resistant to DFTD. The tumors grow, then go away. There are probably a few different aspects to this: The Tasmanian devils themselves are adapting to the cancer, but the cancer is also probably adapting to transmitting, rather than operating as a dead end. 

This is *exactly* as predicted: Interhost competition introduces selection for lower virulence, which means the disease becomes non-fatal. 

&amp;nbsp;

Given how evolutionary theory proposes that populations should change over time, we can make specific predictions about, given a specific change in a population, how its evolutionary trajectory will change. Transmissible cancers provide a ""natural experiment"" to evaluate the veracity of these predictions (and therefore the underlying theory, and the results are *exactly* what we would expect if evolution works the way we think it does.

I am not trying to create a strawman, as I have been so often accused, but to open a discussion on my personal specialty: hominids. 

Anyways, AiG sees humans as wholly unique from animals, something I covered in a previous thread as taxonomically untrue. This organisation relegates the hominids in odd ways, lumping them in somewhat indistinguishable ways. For instance, they claim *H. neanderthalensis* was human. Not a human *kind*, but actually human. I have a different opinion, clearly. 

But the topic is on the middle-way hominids. These organisms are all ""Muddles-In-The-Middle"" even to professional Anthropologists, particularly *H. habilis.* Should it be an australopithicine? I'll leave it to you guys.

Brain case: 550-700 cm SQ and 3-4 ft

Known from: several nearly complete skulls, some post crania

[Homo habilis](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-habilis) is the first animal classified as genus Homo, rather than an australopithicine. It has reduced prognathism, smaller canines and a smaller brow ridge. It's small, like it's predecessors, but it's body ratio is trending towards human, although the arms are still ""too long"". It was certainly obligately bipedal, due to it's knees and ventral foremen magnum. H. habilis is found frequently with stone tools.

***Homo rudolfensis***: 1.9-1.8 mya

Brain case: 775 cm SQ and 3-4 ft

Known from: a single skull and some post crania indicating it is apart from H. habilis

[Homo rudolfensis](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-rudolfensis) is considered unique from H. habilis, but only recently so. It has unique features not within species variety in the constraints of natural selection: ""larger braincase, longer face, and larger molar and premolar teeth. Due to the last two features, though, some scientists still wonder whether this species might better be considered an *Australopithecus*, although one with a large brain!"" If H. rudolfensis is a transitioning form of H habilis, it likely used tools as well although to my knowledge no direct tools have been found with it.

***Homo georgicus***: 1.7 mya

Brain case: 600 cm SQ and 3.5-5 ft

Known from: Four fossil skeletons and many partials

[Homo georgicus](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) is somewhat controversial in it's ranking. It has a small braincase size for Homo and more ""old traits"": showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs, providing greater mobility. They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between [*Australopithecus*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus) and *Homo erectus*, and have been dated at 1.8 million years before the present. Tool use is observed both in finding tools with the specimens and cuts in animals bones found alongside specimens.

***Homo eragaster*** 1.9-1.5 mya

Brain case: 600-910 cm SQ and 4-5 feet

Known from: One nearly complete skeleton, some complete skulls and some post crania

[Homo ergaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster) also is controversial in it's ranking. It's high cranial diversity and occipital traits make it likely that H. eragaster is either a late transition of Homo erectus or is actually early representations of H. erectus itself. However,  *H. ergaster* may be distinguished from *H. erectus* by its thinner skull-bones and lack of an obvious supraorbital foremen, and from *H. heidelbergensis* by its thinner bones, more protrusive face, and lower forehead. Tool use, just as the previous.

***Homo erectus*** 1.8 mya-145,000 (some suggest even 30,000)

Brain case: 900-1000 cm SQ and 4-6 feet

Known from: Dozens of fossils varying from nearly complete skeletons to individual skulls and post crania

[Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) is one of the best represented fossils in many regards. It can b difficult to pinpoint exactly how many due to it's many subspecies and reputation as a highly variable species. It sports unique teeth from modern humans, as well as many cranial features (such as zygomatics). It's brain case is far smaller than even our smallest range for a normal phenotype, and yet, H. erectus settlements show fire use and more sophisticated tools than it's predecessors. This animal is found nearly all over, from Africa to Europe to Asia. It is likely it proliferated into the H. neanderthalensis (we have genetic hybrid bones) Denisovans and H. floresiensis. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think? For the record, I will include Homo sapiens for comparison: 

***Homo sapiens***: 300,000-present

Brain case: 1200-1350 cm SQ, 4-6 ft

Known from: extreme proliferation everywhere

Homo sapiens is known to have several traits which place it in genus homo, and a few which make it unique from the others also in it. Tall, lanky posture with enormous brains (focused on the frontal lobe) and advanced tool use. Anatomically modern humans can be classified by lighter build skeletons than their predecessors. Skull is thin-walled and high-vaulted with flat, near vertical foreheads. Reduced prognathism and brow ridges as well, small mandibles and teeth comparatively. Narrow hips support the most efficient biped hominid of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, all the hominids in this list are bipedal, used tools and are classified in the genus ""Homo"".",36,1551596947,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/awrocy/open_challenge_to_creationists_what_kind_are/
DebateEvolution,awjcqy,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Could you answer The Vise Strategy?,"In 2005, William Dembski released The Vice Strategy document. The intent was to subpoena evolution promoting scientists, and to interrogate them about evolution and intelligent design.

As part of that document, there is a long list of questions that Dembski suggests the interrogator ask the evolutionist. These are presented in sequence, as a suggested interrogation procedure, which Dembski believes will force the evolutionist to admit that intelligent design is science.

This is the link to the document, the questions start on page 4:

https://billdembski.com/documents/2005.11.Vise_Strategy.pdf

When I said it was a long list, I wasn't kidding. Rather than write up a response to 9 pages of questions (and expect anyone but myself to read it!) I thought you guys might have fun picking it apart. Pick a question, or a series of questions, and show your answers. How would you respond if you were subject to this interrogation?

I'll start with a few:

&gt; Could you explain the scientific status of methodological materialism? For instance, you stated
that testability is a criterion for true science. Is there any scientific experiment that tests
methodological materialism? Can you describe such an experiment?

Methodological naturalism isn't a scientific theory, in the same way as evolution or gravity. As the name suggests, it's a method of science. It's a very simple one too. It is the reasonable conclusion of a single prediction: That everything we find will be natural, and that one prediction is repeatedly fulfilled with every discovery. It is a tentative conclusion, that would be proven invalid the moment an actual supernatural discovery is made. But even those who profess to believe in the supernatural aren't surprised when such a discovery is never made.

So to reiterate, there's no single experiment that can test for MN. Rather, it's a broad assessment of all discoveries, and what you should reasonably expect of further discoveries.

&gt; Are there theoretical reasons from science for accepting methodological materialism? For
instance, we know on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics that the search for
perpetual motion machines cannot succeed. Are there any theoretical reasons for thinking
that scientific inquiries that veer outside the strictures of methodological materialism
cannot succeed? Can you think of any such reasons?

No, there's nothing we know that makes the supernatural impossible. But nor is there anything we know of that makes the supernatural possible.

&gt; A compelling reason for holding to methodological materialism would be if it could be
demonstrated conclusively that all natural phenomena invariably submit to materialistic
explanations. Is there any such demonstration? 

Obviously not, but as I said before that's not the purpose of MN.

&gt; [Suppose here the success of evolutionary theory is invoked to justify methodological
materialism -- i.e., so many natural phenomena have submitted successfully to
materialistic explanation that it constitutes a good rule of thumb/working hypothesis. In
that case we ask:]

&gt; But wouldn’t you agree that there are many natural phenomena for which we haven’t a clue how
they can be accounted for in terms of materialistic explanation? Take the origin of life?
Isn’t the origin of life a wide open problem for biology, one which gives no indication of
submitting to materialistic explanation. 

Absolutely. But as MN states, every time in history, when we have not known something, and then we discovered the answer, the answer has always been natural. Because of that, it's reasonable to assume that the same is true of any of today's unknowns, including the origin of life.

(I'm skipping the next one because it depends on me answering ""no"" to the above.)

&gt; Would you agree, then, that methodological materialism is not scientifically testable, that there is
no way to confirm it scientifically, and therefore that it is not a scientific claim? Oh, you
think it can be confirmed scientifically? Please explain exactly how is it confirmed
scientifically? I’m sorry, but pointing to the success of materialistic explanations in
science won’t work here because the issue with materialistic explanations is not their
success in certain cases but with its success across the board. Is there any way to show
scientifically that materialistic explanations provide a true account for all natural
phenomena? Is it possible that the best materialistic explanation of a natural phenomenon
is not the true explanation? If this is not possible, please explain why not. [Keep
hammering away at these questions until you get a full concession that methodological
naturalism is not testable and cannot be confirmed scientifically.] 

You don't confirm or test MN by proving that it is right, and that's not MN's intent. Indeed, disproving the existence of the supernatural is disproving something unfalsifiable; logically impossible. MN is a method, and you confirm or test a method by looking at its reliability. And so far, MN has shown to be reliable.

&gt; Since methodological materialism is not a scientific claim, what is its force as a rule for science?
Why should scientists adopt it? [The usual answer here is “the success of science.”]

Because it's always been successful.

&gt; But if methodological materialism’s authority as a rule for science derives from its success in
guiding scientific inquiry, wouldn’t it be safe to say that it is merely a working hypothesis
for science? And as a working hypothesis, aren’t scientists free to discard it when they
find that it “no longer works”?

Absolutely. If we ever discovered something supernatural, then MN could be rationally disregarded.

&gt; It’s sometimes claimed that the majority of scientists have adopted methodological materialism
as a working hypothesis. But have all scientists adopted it? Is science governed by
majority rule?

Obviously not all scientists have adopted it, else we wouldn't be here. No, science isn't governed by majority rule.

&gt; If [as the witness will by now hopefully have admitted] methodological materialism is not a
scientific claim, how can it be unscientific for ID theorists to discard it as a working
hypothesis for science? In the absence of methodological materialism as a regulative
principle for science, what else is there that might prevent ID from being developed into a
full-fledged science? You claimed earlier that ID is not testable. Is that the reason you
think ID cannot be developed into a full-fledged science? 

In the case of ID and creationism, you can't just discard MN because you want the supernatural to exist, and expect to be taken seriously as a science. So much of ID is looking at things we don't know, in areas of science that aren't well understood, and filling the blanks with God. Why do you think they don't stick to things we do know about? They used to. They used to be all about bacterial flagellums, eyes, transitional fossils. But now it's all gene sequences, molecular biology, and maths on genetics. They stopped asking about things we know a lot about because when we know a lot about something, we know it doesn't work for creationism.",3,1551543901,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/awjcqy/could_you_answer_the_vise_strategy/

DebateEvolution,aw8d7a,Covert_Cuttlefish,I sniff rocks for a living,t2_3bkhfykq,self.DebateEvolution,,The Wedge Document.,"I recently picked up a copy of the ‘Skeptics Guide to the Universe’ by Steven Novella et al.  I’d highly recommend the book to everyone here. While I’ve yet to finish the book, it’s a great primer on logical thinking and pseudoscience vs science.

Novella brought the ‘[Wedge Document]( https://ncse.com/creationism/general/wedge-document)’ to my attention. For the few of you here who don’t know (I hope I’m not the only one late to this party) the Wedge Document is a 1998 document produced by Steve Meyer’s Center for Science and Culture (Discovery Institute) or DI for short.  

The document is very clear in it’s goals:


Goal #1: To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies.


Goal #2: To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.

I’m sure some of you are wondering what the destructive moral, cultural and political legacies of scientific materialism are.


According to the document:

&gt;Materialists denied the existence of objective moral standards, claiming that environment dictates our behavior and beliefs… Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment… Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.

While the above is extremely fallacious, that’s out of the scope of ‘debate evolution’, or as /u/ DarwinZDF42 suggested ‘[Refute creationism for lurkers]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/av7f5w/since_nobody_actually_refutes_evolution_shouldnt/ehd9b92/)’.


According to Meyer, the DI should:

&gt; strive to overthrow… …materialism and its cultural legacies.  

How should the DI achieve it’s goals? 

&gt;‘By using [creationism] … … to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview.’


Creationists are attacking science in an orchestrated manner. I have no doubt that some members of the creationist movement are [useful idiots]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot), so we should strive to show creationists respect, and continue to attempt to educate those who have not demonstrated willful ignorance. However we should not bend; educate those who are here to learn, and fight pseudoscience with all your might. Make no mistake, creationism is 100% pseudoscience. Treat it as such.

In the unlikely event that the above failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that creationism is pseudoscience, we need look no further than /u/Kanbei85 post ‘[The Bible provides the foundation for all sound reasoning, morality, and the platform from which we can expect to do successful science to begin with.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/avq9ck/how_prevalentvocal_are_creationists_in_your/ehirwd4/). The demarcation problem can be a blurry line, but starting an examination into the nature of reality with a conclusion distills that blurry line into an electric fence and creationism is not only on the wrong side of the fence, it is pissing on the fence in an attempt to short it out.

We owe a great deal to past, present and future scientists for laying the groundwork for our incredible quality of life. I think there is an argument that the ‘worst off’ person reading this has a better quality of life than the most wealthy did only a few generation ago.  My own mother grew up w/o running water, and she’s in her early 60s. These attacks on science and a secular world view may be driven by a fallacious understanding of the mortality of heathens, but it will ultimately result in a worse quality of life for future generations if successful.  
 

As an aside, regulars might recognize my flair, for various reasons I’ve decided to retire my old account and start anew.  My personal goal is substantially cut down on ‘internet time’ (and as a result this sub). Without diving too deep into why, I’ve failed to adjust to new realities in my life and I don’t want to wake up in 10 years and realize I’ve squandered moments I can’t relive. I’ll still check in from time to time (especially when I’m stuck at the damn rig). Hopefully my post quantity will decrease, and the quality will increase.

Keep up the good fight, and remember, if you want to disprove a theory, you must replace it with a better one, not simply discount the old one. I’ve yet to see a single creationist submit a falsifiable hypothesis that can outperform the accepted theory in both explaining observations and making accurate predictions.  
All the best

[Original thread here.

[Creationist response.](http://blog.drwile.com/no-these-researchers-did-not-see-a-single-celled-organism-evolve-into-a-multicellular-organism/?fbclid=IwAR0zoWfFnQJW7zVBFzqj55-w7QX8s1WIuGIxNYSGrNu6C151FbFB0t0t6tM)

[r/creation thread on response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/avxgk8/no_these_researchers_did_not_see_a_singlecelled/) 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the relevant part of the purported refutation:

&gt;The study examined the behavior of a green algae in the species charmingly named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In the wild, these algae exist as individual, single-celled organisms. In the lab, the researchers exposed some of them to a natural predator (Paramecium tetraurelia) and found that the algae would come together and form colonies, since that made them less likely to be eaten by the predator. In other words, several individual single-celled organisms would “team up” to gain protection from the predator.

Nope. That's not what happened. From the original paper linked above:

&gt;Some strains, notably those from population B2, appeared to form amorphous clusters of variable cell number (Fig. 1A). Other strains, notably those from population B5, commonly formed stereotypic eight-celled clusters, with an apparent unicellular and tetrad life stage (Fig. 1B). Other phenotypic differences could be easily discerned by light microscopy. For example, in Fig. 1, an external membrane is visible around both evolved multicellular colonies, **indicating that they formed clonally via repeated cell division within the cluster, rather than via aggregation.**

Emphasis mine. ""Formed clonally"" means ""from a single cell dividing"", which is different from ""teaming up"". 

From later in the paper:

&gt;Conversely, three of the strains isolated from population B2 exist in cell clusters **comprised only of direct descendants, as opposed to chimeric aggregations with free-swimming cells.** Clusters from strains B2-11, B2-03, and B2-04 grow in tightly associated groups **of direct descendants embedded in the maternal cell wall** (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Videos 7, 8 and 9, respectively). Development in these isolates is therefore strictly clonal, with important implications for evolvability.

I mean, they specifically say ""it's via cell division, not aggregation"", and there are *videos* of this process. It's kind of hard to make this mistake. 

&amp;nbsp;

Dr. Wile, the creationist who authored this ""rebuttal"", doubles down on this error:

&gt;Here is where the new study is different. When they removed the predator, the cells stayed together. They even reproduced together. Indeed, the researchers report that even though the predator was removed four years ago, the cells have stayed in groups and reproduced in groups. As a result, they say they have produced an obligate multicellular form of the organism: one that stays together even when it could split into individual cells again.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Let’s say that even in the wild, this group of algae stays a group and is therefore truly an obligate multicellular form of the algae. Does this tell us anything about the origin of multicellularity? No. **All it shows is that single-celled organisms which already tend to clump together in groups when the need arises will sometimes stay in groups, even when the initial reason for the formation of the group is gone.**

Emphasis mine again. *This is not what the study showed*. The entire argument is built on that error. The structures in question did not form via aggregation. They grew clonally from a single founding cell. Therefore not only does the ""refutation"" fail to call the findings into question; it doesn't even discuss them.

&amp;#x200B;

The exchange went like this. u/witchdoc86 was making  a point on the broken GULO gene (a gene which, when functioning properly, helps an organism synthesize Vitamin C) in primates (haplorhines and up I believe). This is indicative of common descent, at *least* of all primates (including humans) from a common ancestor who propagated a broken GULO gene. Witchdoc86 pointed out that the alternative is that in each primate species in haplorhini independently had their GULO gene broken in the same place in some sort of mass degeneration attempt. 

This is something that even Creationist site [Evolutionnews.com](https://Evolutionnews.com) can [admit](https://evolutionnews.org/2012/02/gulo_shared_mut/): "" The hypothesis of limited common descent seems to me, for the time being, a reasonable one. Perhaps it is the case that all taxa belonging to the Primate Order are related by descent."" Although they still do reject common ancestry as a whole, lest someone accuse me of quote mining.

u/mike_enders responded to this comment with some thoughts  

*"" Now this makes some sense. If it holds up (dubious at best) that its junk DNA then you will have a point. Your argument is essentially we have this similarity and it stretches belief that this similarity just occurs for any other reason but descent.*

*But Look at you with your bad self :) - I can tell by the way you write you think this is a KILLER proof of evolution based on the improbability of getting this molecular similarity. No rational human being who loves science can ever deny that this is just not likely to occur for no good reason and common descent must be it because these are closely related species in your theory. I mean how dumb can creationist get in their bone headed commitment to religion and deny this is the best fit?*

*Those stupid creationists can't seriously try to float that this molecular similarity just happened to CONVERGE within humans and apes.*

*Now of course now that you have seen me capitalize converge you might want to start back pedaling with your probability argument because like the wild dog about to take a piece out of the mail man - its about to bite you in the rear end.*

*Its cherry picking because when you see a molecular similarity you can't see anything but a direct proof of your thesis but when a creationist uses the EXACT same rationality and logic for molecular convergence - AGAIN the EXACT same improbabilty argument your side says its not a valid argument - its an argument from incredulity.*

*In molecular convergence you are looking at the same DNA and seeing a similarity nearly exact to what youa e referring to - that CANNOT exist because of close inheritance relationship and yet if you are like mos darwinists you will deny the same logic you just finished arguing for and start to do back strokes because if you don't its a STRONG evidence* ***against*** *evolution.*

*and that doesn't fit your bias and the kicker?*

*the ""broken"" genes you allude occur in hot spots so there is some basis for saying things can get broken in similar ways but you have ZERO explanation for how the mutations of molecular convergence appear for two unrelated species (natural selection only preserves sequences not cause them) and if a creationist makes the same argument you are making for GULO,the same logic is then labelled as an ""argument from incredulity"".*

Now, Mike has banned me but hopefully someone can get this to them: this is a false equivalence for many reasons, making this comment's thesis incorrect.

[Convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#At_molecular_level) is perhaps not what they think it is. "" The independent [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) of similar features in species of different lineages. Convergent evolution creates **analogous structures** that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Point being, we don't tend to see identical molecular structures (such as complex metabolic pathways) evolve independently in two separate organisms that aren't related. We may see incredibly similar ones. Genetically, this implication is true: both fruit bats AND primates have lost the ability to synthesize Vitamin C, but not in identical places or in identical ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

The difference is Mike is suggesting that convergent evolution is like lightning striking the same place twice in every thunderstorm in say, Tulsa, for a year. When the reality is perhaps that once a year, lightning will strike within 50 feet of another preceding strike in the same storm. I know the reality of lightning strikes is probably very different but I'm not a meteorologist. 

&amp;#x200B;

**However.** The scenario Mike attempts to compare as equivalent, that all haplorhine primates happened to break the same GULO gene in the same location independently as a part of some kind of ""Coincidental Degradation"" is truly akin to winning the lottery over one hundred times...*playing the exact same number each time.* 

&amp;#x200B;

And that's just for one mutation in one family, let along all the mutations in all the taxa AND their ERV's. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this wasn't inappropriate, while I am not on excellent terms with Mike my intent is more to clear things up so those stumbling across that thread don't take it as a viable comparison rather than make a ""callout"". Although I suppose that's still inadvertently what this is. If this breaks any rules feel free to take it down.

Even if you are accepting of Evolutionary Theory, humans have no discernible separation from the Great Apes in regard to our criteria for classification at  a family level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Genetically, we have the basic similarities at a profile level primarily. Humans differ from chimpanzees and bonobos by 5-2% when compared by genetic profile (the exact same method we use to determine *paternity* in humans). And, while numbers can vary in regard to specific sections, humans are *closest* to chimps and bonobos in every potential comparison when in contrast to other organisms tested. 

Remarkably, this goes for the chimps and bonobos as well: *We* are *their* closest relatives, even when compared to the other African Apes. 

Our [vitamin C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145266/) gene is broken in the exact same place, across all of the haplorhines as well, a coincidence that cannot be reasonably explained outside common ancestry. And among the primates, including humans, our [ERV's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2001186/) match us up as well.

The underlying point for genetics is: Humans have direct relation to the other great apes, lesser apes, old and new world monkeys, tarsiers, lorises and lemurs respectively than ANY other animal group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Physiologically, we compare to chimpanzees and bonobos most closely as well. Their skeleton mostly closely resembles ours among living organisms, and they thrive with their habitual bipedality. Together we sport grasping hands, binocular vision, an identical dental formula (2123), low but present sexual dimorphism, altricial young with large braincases, similar gestational/rearing periods and flatter faces in comparison to the other mammals. Our young are born with the grasping reflex for holding mother's fur, and we still retain this today. We are covered with close to the same number of hair follicles, but our fur/hair is much thinner than theirs. Both of us share an omnivorous diet primarily plant based (with the advent of cereals for modern humans) but take meat at every opportunity. 

&amp;#x200B;

And behaviorally the chimps and the bonobos occupy our own extremes: the warlike, patriarchal common chimps (pan troglodytes) versus the sexual, matricarchal bonobos (pan paniscus). They, like us, use tools and thrive in fission/fusion social groups.

There is no other group to place humans cladistically, nor would any sane taxonomist do so. We are share more with the apes in our family than some canids do with the dogs in their own.

Thus, I maintain there is NO excuse for attempting to give humans their own ""Kind"" even from a YEC perspective, if one is arguing for scientific validity. If you wish to claim it is so because God made humans unique, this is fine, but you cannot make an honest argument from a biologic perspective.

The only thing that seems to be a problem for them is a set of created kinds with humans being their own kind of life superior to everything else isn't supported by any field of actual science, nor is the global flood for that matter.

The rest of the creationist argument seems to be about misunderstanding reality, misrepresenting biology, or failing to comprehend deep time. They want to be special creations so they'll come up with anything, even cherry picking quotes, to attempt to hold onto the illusion of intellectual superiority. However, when it comes to what evolution is or what it entails they either accept it outright or try to impose barriers that don't actually exist. If anyone can do better at supporting creationism than this perhaps we might actually have something to debate, but as I see it there are two types of people: the ones who accept evolution and the ones who don't understand it. We can fix that through education better than we can by pretending that there are multiple plausible possibilities behind biological diversity and the genetic and morphological similarities that are quite evident.

Mike, as I'm sure you're aware, once we get back to ~2.1 billion years ago, the geological record is getting pretty damn spotty.

DebateEvolution,apz0bh,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"An Evolutionary Biology Student Dissects Chapter 7 of Jeanon's ""Replacing Darwin"" Explaining the Flawed Methodology as well as Jeanson's Lack of Understanding some of the Basics of Evolutionary Theory","Their conclusion is pasted below:

 

* Jeanson argues that the nested hierarchy pattern of differences in mtDNA might not indicate common descent, and instead fit a design model. He offers no evidence to support this idea but proposes a way it could be tested. The only problem is that that test would be prohibitively difficult to actually perform, and even though Jeanson won’t be the one striving to do it, he says that we should suspend all judgment until the test has been done. That’s not how science works. We go with the best evidence available at the time, and in this case, it doesn’t support him.
* Instead of paying attention to patterns of nested hierarchy, Jeanson says that a simpler test is to use observed mutation rates and available genetic sequences to calculate the ages of groups of organisms. Starting with humans, he introduces a human mitochondrial mutation rate that’s approximately 10x too fast because he generalises the mutation rate in a particularly rapidly-mutating region of the mitochondrial genome to the entire sequence. Next, he argues that we “evolutionists” *must* assume constant mutation rates to be internally consistent with our own approach, but gives himself a fair bit of wiggle room in this department.
* Using his faulty mutation rate, a wide range of generation times, and data on the number of mtDNA sequence differences between human populations, humans and Neanderthals, and humans and chimps, Jeanson concludes that evolutionary timescales are far too long to accurately match the data. Instead, he shows that, with some significant massaging (invoking unrealistic generation times, increased mutation rates, and the supposed unreliability of ancient DNA sequences), he can get the human mtDNA diversity to fit into a 6,000-year timeframe.
* Jeanson claims that mitochondrial haplogroups provide evidence of all modern humans tracing their maternal ancestry back to 3 women and that these 3 women were the wives of Noah’s sons that repopulated the world after the flood. This conclusion was based on a catastrophic misunderstanding of phylogenetic tree topology ([it wouldn’t be the first time](https://roohif.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/the-cytochrome-b-equidistance-problem/)).
* He performs similar calculations for 7 other animal genera (“kinds”) with data available and says that 3 of them matched his predictions. Even if I generously count the human and Daphnia data as matching his predictions, ignore the *P. pacificus* data, and add in my own analysis of the chimps and bonobos, Jeanson’s model still has a less than 50% success rate. I don’t think that’s very impressive, but Jeanson is confident he’s on the right track.
* Throughout the discussion of the discrepancies between observed mutation rates and evolutionary timescales Jeanson consistently avoids the explanation that the mainstream literature provides: time-dependent mutation rate slowdown. He does mention natural selection as a possible explanation but dismisses it because it’s not predictive and therefore unscientific. Except, as I show, it *does* make predictions which been found to be accurate. He will bring up his critique of natural selection as an explanation again in the next chapter, and I will expand more on this subject then.

This is just...not even close. At all. I don't know about the third author, but Carter and Sanford are both geneticists. They know better. This is not what the Y or mt MRCA means. 

[We've been through this before,](https://np.reddit.com/r/debatecreation/comments/7bnqz7/embarrassingly_bad_genetic_analysis_by/) but briefly, the Y-MRCA is the male from whom all extant *Y chromosomes* are descended.

&gt; I really don't think that there is any point trying to prove this sort of stuff to people who ardently believe in evolution. There is nothing that you can say that will convince them. Things like probability and design that would be totally obvious to them and us in other areas are twisted and reinterpreted in bizarre ways to allow them to continue to believe in evolution.

&gt; I don't have the energy to point out the problems in this because it is guaranteed to go absolutely no where. He is implying that we are looking for a designer and have to know/have evidence of the designer. That's not true and not a requirement for deciding if something is designed or not. He is also impying that he needs to know the mechanism for how something was made before it can be classified as being designed. This too is ludicrous. You can take a radio to any civilized people from 200 years ago and they can tell that it is designed. The don't know anything about the company that made it or the process/mechanism by which it was made. We tell if something is designed by looking at it to see if it has features of design and features that cannot be explained by the natural processes that we see around us.

&gt; I just can't keep trying to bash some sense into these people. It seems like a complete waste of time. It would be different if any of them actually ever admitted to learning something from our conversations, if there was any benefit at all. Personally, I try to make sure that when I discuss something at /r/debateevolution (and am not called a fool or a liar by people who don't even know me) and when I learn something (typically about biochemistry) that I make a point of saying so and appreciating it. I can't ever remember anyone who supports evolution admitting to learning anything from discussions about splisosomes, meiosis, etc. Anything. So I'm just disengaging from them.

He gets pats on his back from fellow creationists, but [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aopqi2/not_all_id_probability_arguments_are_afterthefact/eg40k56/) from Br56u7 reveals how much projection these people vomit without the slightest hint of irony:

&gt; Personally, I try to make an effort to refute some of their arguments for the people here, or just to challenge myself. But the intellectual dishonesty is frustrating. I'm being reminded of all this now as people accuse me of being a white supremacist their.

He seemingly forgets that he just made a point to say that he wants an ethnostate with only whites (non-minorities, he says, but then admits non-minorities is only white people) who speak fluent English and assimilate into American culture, but can't define what this culture is. He unfortunately does not comprehend that this makes him a white supremacist.

To further illustrate the disconnect that those creationists have with what they believe we're guilty of, Dzugavili, one of the few rational people allowed to post on /r/creation, [commented](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/aopqi2/not_all_id_probability_arguments_are_afterthefact/eg2ox0i/):

&gt; The problem is that the vast majority of the universe doesn't appear to be underdoing abiogenesis: thus, there is no violation of large numbers. As you put it:

&gt; &gt; A favorite example of a violation of the law of large numbers is coming across a table where 500 fair coins are 100% in the heads configuration. We would not expect randomly flipped coins to do this!

&gt; You might, if there were literally billions of tables, all around you. The law of large numbers suggests that eventually, given enough trials, this situation will occur.

&gt; The fatal flaw in Sal's argument is that he hasn't checked any other tables. He's looked here, saw we won, then decided he was right. He actually hasn't done any of the hard work involved in checking his conclusion. There has been zero effort to reconcile the anthropic principle: that he is alive to do this measurement means he's going to be on a planet where life is already possible, and thus it will always appear to be a violation of the law of large numbers, if taken solely from this perspective.

&gt; There are over 250 billion stars in the Milky Way: we have searched one of them. Does this seem like we violated the law of large numbers, or is 250 billion unsearched stars a red flag about this argument?

And gets piled on by creationists not only misunderstanding his point, but continuing the same illogical conclusions that the OP made.

It is quite amazing that a group of people will blame this subreddit for refusing to learn anything when discussions happen, while they limit discussions on their subreddit by requiring approved commentors and refuse to address the points made by rational folks trying to explain how their conclusions were wrongly reached.

DebateEvolution,ao759j,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Human Evolution and Race,"Given the most recent thread, I think it might be wise to run a quick crash course on the emergence of race, and the differences between races, in our global population of Homo sapiens. I am not an expert, so I will try and link some studies to back my claims.

&amp;#x200B;

The anthropologic consensus is overwhelming: anatomically modern humans all evolved from Homo heidelbergensis, a species of hominid distinct from H. erectus and H. Neanderthalensis. What makes H. heidelbergensis unique from sapiens? Loads of distinct skeletal traits. Heidelbergensis has a brain case of 1000-1220 cc's (large for erectus and small for sapiens), the prognathism seen in earlier species is continuing to diminish, and the browridge is still much too large to be considered modern sapiens. We see a larger nasal cavity as well, a trend that continues in H. neanderthalensis, which would have greatly helped it's ability to warm air before it passes into it;s throat and lungs. 

H. heidelbergensis yields H. sapiens in a specialization event in Africa, and potentially  H. neanderthalensis in Europe (it isn't totally clear whether neanderthalensis is a derivative of erectus or heidelbergensis, but to my knowledge the latter is more accepted).

While inbreeding has been [confirmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947341/) to have occurred between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis (as well the latter and denisovans) all modern humans are of the same species (redundant I suppose) and all modern humans can trace their ancestry to H. Heidelbergensis primarily. This is in direct contrast to a chart shared [by u/kanbei85](https://imgur.com/a/SOGqrIo) which is incredibly outdated and proposes races split off in separate species of genus Homo. This, as shown, is patently incorrect. 

[The breakdown of race](http://time.com/91081/what-science-says-about-race-and-genetics/) occurred recently and quickly in human history, and differences accounted for are minor and limited to anatomic traits beneficial to the region. [Allele variance](https://web.stanford.edu/group/rosenberglab/papers/popstruct.pdf) is accounted for in this landmark study, which supports a single regional location for the origin of humanity in a modern sense. 

As such, assertions that genetics separate race on anything more than a level constituting ""minute regional morphologic variants"" is false, and abjectly not supported by evolutionary theory. The study of Biological Anthropology, or Human Evolution, asserts that ALL modern humans descend from a recent hominid, H. heidelbergensis, and that our races are recent phenomena dictated by geographic necessity. That isn't to say there are not genetic differences, but they are incredibly small, thus human diversity is relatively low in comparison to the other hominids (such as say, H. erectus).

All in all, at present it appears there is more variety within the ""races"" than there is between them, and there is no accepted evidence that intelligence aptitude differs through the races as they IQ cannot be isolated from socioeconomic factors at present.

The book Schaeffer 2014 also goes over the literature fairly well too with their meta analysis and that honestly would show the same. 
&gt; 
&gt; This association is problematic because it impairs a society's [social capital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital) which is the ability of a society to work together and it impacts things like happiness, health, support for the public good and numerous other measures (Schaffer 2014 also goes over the direct correlation between diversity and some of these traits too.)  The literature has gone over nearly every covariate you could think of, like socioeconomic, education, linguistic variables, immigrant status, population density, crime etc. [Dineson 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122415577989?journalCode=asra), [koopmans 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24913947/) and [dineson 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00289.x) are some example studies.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why I support ethnonationalism and do not want whites to become the minority in the US. My other reason is race and IQ. [rindermein 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804158/) is a survey of intelligence experts on the matter just so you know I'm not talking bonkers here, but I do believe their are biological differences favoring east asians, whites, Hispanics and black people accordingly and that these differences are about 80% heritable. You can look at [Ruston and Jenson](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0583Lr43gAhXwQd8KHcHqAT8QFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0thbm3F_1RNZT8qZR5wmS5) for a review of 30 years of the evidence on this matter, but the Evidence is just overwhelming. For example, [piffer 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001087) looked at various intelligence related alleles across several nationalities and found that the variance correlated highly (r= .91) with national IQ data compiled from Richard Lynn. Square that r value and you find that almost 83% of the variance in national IQ scores is explained by genomic factors and that the heritability is around 83%. Of course, I don't think certain races are just less than human and I always acknowledge exceptions, but this is what the data shows and we have to take it in account for our immigration system. Regression to the mean is also why we need a race based and not just IQ based immigration system. What RM is, is that when genetic exceptions to a population mean are recorded, the children and grand children of such people will regress towards the population average for their trait. Rushton 2005 goes over this ( and its one of the ways we know these IQ gaps are genetic)

One of the major differences between science and religions is religion holds tightly to is authority.  No scientist is an authority on their subject, expert sure, but not an authority. As such, all scientists should entertain questions from students of the science.  When I say students, I mean that fairly informally, meaning to include science enthusiasts etc.

While I have always had my issues with Sal, I was able to overlook enough of them to engage with him from time to time. If for no other reason than some banter when I’m bored at work. Seeing as how Sal fancies himself a scientist, I had always thought he follows the creed of always being open to having his beliefs questions, open dialog, and freedom of speech.

I was shocked when I commented on his /r/intelligentdesign sub, saying I wasn’t surprised when he quote mined, only to be instantly banned, and being told I’m bad for business. Clearly this is reddit, and he has all the right in the world to run yet another sub, however he lost his last shed of respect I had for him, that being he was always willing to step up to the plate and have someone counter his posts.  

Claiming to hold scholarly discussions without allowing dissenting viewpoints is an oxymoron. 

Sal, if you need a place were there is no dissenting opinions to proselytize your views you can’t claim to be arguing in good scientific faith as you’re acting as an authoritarian.  Science only works with the discussion of ideas, and must be open to function, your closing of open discussion is unacceptable as long as you want to call yourself a scientist. 

Don’t take this as an apology for my saying your too scared to defend your views, calling you a snow flake who needs a safe space etc.  That’s all true as long as you’re hiding out in a sub in order to proselytize. Let people (and even this stupid for an issue that has been settled for ~150 years) both sides and come to their own conclusions.  The ONLY reason to shut down the other side of an issue is when you know your wrong, otherwise your facts should stand by themselves.

I wanted to flesh out my position a bit better, like I said earlier, we’re done here.

DebateEvolution,anif52,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,A Question to Those Who do not Accept Evolutionary Theory: How Would You Define a Transitional Fossil or Form? What Would You need to See to Classify an Organism as Transitional?,"I have frequent chats with a Young Earth Creationist friend over coffee, and we recently were discussing Paleontology. I personally find transitional fossils quite compelling in regards to evolutionary theory, and asked him what he defined a ""Transitional Fossil"" as. I couldn't get a super straight answer from him, and mentioned that I felt perhaps his worldview prevented him from having a definition at all, because to acknowledge the traits that define such an organism would put his ideology at risk were we to find something matching his stipulations. 

I gave my own definition and we agreed it was fairly solid, although he had the caveat that geologic time is an interpretable field:

&amp;#x200B;

A transitional fossil is a fossil which occupies a morphologic and geologic space between two other organisms, whose traits are a ratio of the those held by the initial species and those held by the final species. It must occupy a geologic period between the two species, or it is relegated to a sister group rather than a ""true intermediate"". If there are multiple transitional fossils or forms, the earlier forms must have a ratio of anatomical traits favoring the initial species, and the later forms must have a ratio of traits favoring the final species. 

Additional stipulations involve classification by tell-tale morphologic novelties (like the involucrum in indohyus, ambulocetus, pakicetus, rhodocetus, dorudon, basilosaurus and all living cetaceans). 

True intermediates should thus be relatively rare, although sister groups can frequently be used to track the morphologic novelties and pick up in new geologic layers (this would be delanistes in cetacean evolution).

Does this seem like a fair definition to use? 

If it does not, what do you think works better?

DebateEvolution,amz6td,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,"On the information argument, its definitions, and what it means for creationism.","Some readers here may know that I have a particular interest in the creationist ""information"" argument. Specifically, the argument that says that mutations cannot create new information, or increase information. The reason I find it so interesting is because of how poorly defined the term ""information"" actually is, in this context. 

[After my recent exchange with Paul Price](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/al8a3k/defining_new_genetic_information/), I thought it would be nice to give a basic write up of the whole information argument, to collect what we know about it, and help understand this perplexing claim. It ended up longer than I expected, so I'm sub-heading each section to make it easier for those who (forgivably) want to skim to the parts they like.

**First encounters with information:**

I remember the first time I heard a creationist say that information cannot be increased was in response to the question ""what stops microevolution from building up to macroevolution?"". The first response that came to most people's minds was gene duplication, because we initially assumed that increased information was just a fancy way of saying ""adding base pairs"". But then creationists say that duplication just duplicates information, it doesn't add anything new. So we start explaining that the duplicated gene can then mutate, thus adding something new. But no matter how many examples we presented, or how we tried to explain the mechanisms of mutation and evolution, the creationists would always have a rationalization how how it was always a loss of information.

**Does anyone know what information is?**

It didn't take long for people to start asking the question ""how are you defining information?"". The answers, or lack of answers, were not very helpful. Most creationists wouldn't even attempt to define information. Some would just point to a dictionary definition, or try to use an analogy to language, saying nothing about how it relates to genetics. Some would mention the 5 levels of Gitt information, which doesn't have any relation to information quantity. On rare occasions you would get an actual definition, but in every case they would quickly start backpedaling when examples that fit that definition were presented.

I looked through countless pages of creationist literature, from Answers in Genesis, to Kent Hovind, to the Discovery Institute. Despite page after page of claims that ""evolution cannot create information"", I didn't find a single workable definition of information.

It became clear, very quickly, that **no creationist actually knows what information is.** The creationists may have well been asking for a mutation that increases kwyjiboes, and the argument would make just as much sense.

And this left me perplexed. I knew creationists are big on blind acceptance, but this was a whole other level. How do you go from first hearing the argument, to accepting it, to saying that it's a huge deal for evolution, to posing the question to evolutionists, without once asking what information actually is? Are creationists really that...gullible? There's really no other word to describe it.

**Origins of the information argument:**

I was also left with the question of who started the whole information argument. At some point in history some creationist must have started this argument, that led to every creationist who heard it parroting it without question.

/u/stcordova may have actually found the answer. He believes it was British creationist A.E. Wilder-Smith who first used the argument, in the Huxley Memorial Debate, in 1986. 

For those interested, [Here is the audio of that debate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKtT2hDPCIU) Unfortunately it's a very long debate, but Wilder-Smith's part where he talks about information starts at about 58 minutes in. Wilder-Smith makes the common creationist claim that information can only come from an intelligent source. Later, at 1 hour and 35 minutes in, one of the evolutionists presents an example of information from natural selection and mutation. To which Wilder-Smith responds that it's not a change ""up the ladder"". Unfortunately I can't find more of Wilder-Smith's writings on the subject, so I can't elaborate much more. But it does sound reasonable that this was in fact the first usage of the information argument.

One other important aspect of that particular debate is that Richard Dawkins participated. This is particularly important because a decade later Dawkins was the subject of a video where he was supposedly stumped by the question ""can you name a mutation that has increased information in the genome?"". This, I believe, is the reason the information argument has propagated so much. So many creationists were convinced it was such a damning argument, because their greatest enemy couldn't answer it.

Since then the information argument has evolved (hurr hurr) into a number of other arguments. Dembski's Complex Specified Information, and Sanford's genetic entropy are both descendants of the information argument.

**An exchange with Paul Price:**

In the thread linked above, Creation.com's own Paul Price, under the name of u/kanbei85, was kind enough to answer some questions about the definition of information. Unfortunately, the questioning went about the same as every exchange with Paul goes: A couple of good responses at the start, then he starts to get a little shifty when the questions get difficult, before spitting the dummy and refusing to even read what he was responding to.

But before he spat the dummy, we did learn a few interesting things about information:

* Information can't be measured. For those of us here, that's not very surprising. But it's good to see a creationist actually admit it.
* Instead of measurement, you determine information quantity through intuition.
* This information intuition isn't based on any criteria, you just kind of have to ""feel"" whether information has increased or not.
* All mutations we see today are a loss of information, but creationists can't say why, it just feels that way.
* All the changes necessary to go from bacteria to humans is a gain in information. But creationists can't say why, except that ""it's obvious"".

So there you have it. I wonder if we'll see a scientific paper about that any time soon? It will be the first scientific paper that lists ""Intuition"" and ""It's obvious"" as its only experimental methods. I would think that actual PhD holding scientists would know better than to base an entire field of study around intuition, but I guess not.

**Can information actually be measured or defined?**

Paul made the claim the information is actually really hard to define and measure, but assures us that creationists are working on it.

But the problem is, I think he's wrong. I think information is actually quite easy to define, even for an informed laymen. It should be pretty easy to look through the genetic differences between humans and bacteria, and work out the sort of genetic changes that need to take place. For example, things like increases in substrate binding specificity, beneficial mutations, new proteins, new functions, increases in genetic material, increased catalytic activity. A few of these immediately jump out as things that should count as increases in information, like new functions, substrate specificity, and beneficial mutations. There would also be a few reasonable qualifiers, like benefits not being solely the result of decreased substrate specificity.

But creationists wouldn't do that, for two reasons. The first reason is that creationists don't like thinking about evolution, because it makes them uncomfortable. The second is that any examples of genetic changes that have to happen, are changes that we see happen all the time. And that makes sense, because seeing as a mutation can turn any base into any other base, there wouldn't be any basic change that they can't do. And this is a problem for creationists, because creationists have committed to the idea that information increases never happen, ever!

So rather than take their chances at being proven wrong, they just safely stay ignorant about it. You can't disprove something that isn't defined.",19,1549263815,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/amz6td/on_the_information_argument_its_definitions_and/

I'm sure we're all familiar with it or it's variations - something appears so unlikely to happen naturally therefore its more likely to have been made by an intelligent force is a very high level summary if not.

One of the seemingly key things proponents use to argue for it is that we should use the same criteria everywhere to determine if something was made by an intelligence or not.

This is where I think things fall apart as I think there's three big things you need to make this assessment:

1. Knowledge that at least one intelligent entity exists that is capable of manipulating whatever is necessary to make the observed outcome come to be.

2. Knowledge that things could have actually been different. This is bigger when talking about things like the speed of light and other forces than relating directly to creation/evolution.

3. At least decent estimates as to the likelihood of things under conditions present at the time and decent estimates as to the frequency of ""attempts"" for lack of a better word

I think only with those three things could we say ""the intelligence we know exists was more likely responsible than not"". We might not know which intelligence if there's multiple options, but we can guess that at least one did something.... Probably.

Now 2 and 3 alone are certainly enough to spark interest in how it happened and in some situations may lead us to discovering 1, but they are insufficient to show 1.

So because 1 is a prerequisite for reasonably assuming something was designed, the ""appearance of design"" cannot be used to prove a designer since appearing to be designed requires there be a possible designer.",28,1548940543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/alpbxe/is_the_watchmaker_argument_is_circular/

DebateEvolution,al8a3k,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Defining New Genetic Information,"I often see those who oppose evolutionary theory insist that new genetic information cannot arise by mutation, nor honed by natural selection. I think a major reason for this is a lack of understanding in genetics and how new and novel morphologic or chemical traits arise.


The genetic code is rather similar to the alphabet, with codons and amino acids rather than letters. In the English alphabet, we can spell various different words with different meanings with mere letter changes into sentences that have wholly unique functions in communication. 

""Cat"" can become ""Rat' with a simple point mutation or substitution.

""The cat"" can become ""The cat cat"" with a duplication event and then ""The cat sat"" with a point mutation or substitution. Perhaps a new duplication event occurs, but in a new location (The sat cat sat) followed by another substitution or point mutation and we can have ""The sad cat sat""

""The cat"" is a sentence that gives information, but through mutation (using the same alphabet) we can gain a new sentence that has a new meaning: ""The sad cat sat""


With this analogy, we see sentences become genomes and can imagine how new genetic codes might come about. In the same way ""The cat"" becoming ""The sad cat sat"", genomes mutate and gain new information with new meaning. Losing words too, can result in a new sentence, just as ""losing"" genetic information can give rise to new methods of survival. 

There are many examples of new genetic information arising in this way:

[The Lenski Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) shows e. coli spontaneously gaining the ability to metabolize citrate though a series of subsequent potentiating mutations.

The [Pod Mrcaru Lizards](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2008/04/lizard-evolution-island-darwin/) developed cecal valves after several decades of geographic separation from their relatives, and transitioned from an insectivorous to an herbivorous diet.

[German and Spanish mice](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-14462733) have developed an immunity to warfarin and other poisons we try to throw at them.

Darwin's finches, the peppered moths or fruit flies, they all have experienced mutations and experience morphologic or chemical change, allowing them to increase their odds of survival. But it all begins with the molding clay of evolutionary theory: mutation.

I had a few questions about codon bias, because I am fascinated by viral codon bias, but this was the most important question I asked:

&gt;did you compare metrics such as burst size, burst time, attachment rate, adsorption rate, or doubling time for the different genotypes across the H1N1 dataset?

Answer:

&gt;we did not compute any growth metrics. Our work was done on computer only.

So the whole point of the paper was that H1N1 fitness declined over time due to genetic entropy. Fitness for the viral genotypes in question was not directly measured. Correlates of fitness were not directly measured. Fitness was evaluated based solely on two *extremely* poor proxies: Codon correlation with host, and virulence. 

&amp;nbsp;

We can relitigate why those are terrible ways to measure viral fitness, but that horse is already dead. There are two possible explanations for how they arrived at this conclusion: Neither of these gentlemen are virologists, epidemiologists, or evolutionary biologists, so they were unaware that they were not using appropriate metrics for fitness. Or, they *did* know they were not using appropriate metrics, but they used the data the allowed them to reach the desired conclusion. 

I have no evidence that they deliberately misrepresented the evolutionary trajectory of H1N1 and the dynamics surrounding those changes (and continue to do so), so I have to believe that they are not sufficiently familiar with the intricacies of viral evolutionary dynamics, virus-host interactions, and epidemiology to see why their chosen metrics are inappropriate. 

So anytime this paper comes up down the road, feel free to refer back to this, and dispute the fundamental conclusion, that H1N1 fitness declined during the course of the 20th century.

The thing with creationism is that the most convincing argument for it is ""God made it so it looks like evolution took place"", and it is not convincing at all.

While it seems like ""God did it"" is a simple hypothesis, all the information is contained within the word ""it"". According to the Solomonoff inductive inference formalism of Occam's razor, it means it is the most complex type of hypothesis possible. It fares better than hypotheses that assign a high credence to observations that aren't observed (like normal creationism), sure, but if there is any other theory that predicts the observed data better, it automatically loses due to its lack of predictive power.

Actually it will lose even by itself. ""It just is"" is a better hypothesis than ""God did it"", because both require a full specification of the observations, but ""God did it"" tacks on an extra entity, and we all know about Occam's razor.

So there it is. I can't steelman creationism because the strongest case for the creationist hypothesis is out-competed by a list of what we observe.

PS Same goes for ""God did evolution"". God can be razed by Occam.",74,1548136196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/aijs5b/steelmanning_creationism_cannot_be_done/

Me: ""Lightning comes from the god Zeus."" 

You: ""What? No. That's... where did you get that? Lightning doesn't come from a god. It comes from static electricity in the atmosphere during storms.""

Me: ""Look, I'm telling you Science doesn't even come close to explaining lightning. Did you know that sometimes lightning shows up in ball form? Science can't explain that!""

You: ""For one, ball lightning is rare and still being studied. Secondly, we have a pretty good idea of how it happens. Third, even if science couldn't explain ball lightning that doesn't prove ""Zeus makes lightning"". You can't prove Zues makes lightning by disproving what science says about lightning.

Apparently evolution is too much to talk to a 5 year old about. Anyway, it made me think that perhaps I should post the question to this forum since at least a portion of the answer would be relevant. 

ELI5: How to tax the ocean, how to tax the air?

Can someone please explain to me like I’m five what it is that climate change advocates actually want done? My inability to simply Google the answer to this question leaves me suspicious of the motives behind all the emotional level rage, demonstrations, and protests that I see flashed over the internet, but again, no one saying exactly what they want done about it. The amount of urgent passion does not seem to equal the solutions to global warming.

To the point of the “urgency”: If we are an evolutionary species, and the planet is alive, then why isn’t this warming understood in the context of natural evolution? If it is natural evolution (which occurs over millions of years), what can a few million humans do to stop or alter it? Wouldn’t future inhabitants simply evolve along with the host and adapt to the gradual (1 million years) or sudden (100 years) change?

The “climate deniers” don’t have my vote either. It seems from simple internet searches that their collective position is that we (America? The West? Industrialized societies?) don’t need another Government Agency to tax the gross national product of the above entities. Only this rebuttal of the denier’s sheds light on what the advocates may want but isn’t explicitly stated. It seems from this stance of the deniers that the advocates want another government agency, most likely a Global Level Agency, that has the authority to tax multinational corporations in the name of reducing the shrinking ice plateaus in Greenland, the rising sea levels in Indonesia, and the air in Los Angeles and Beijing. A tax which must inevitably reach the pockets of all citizens in some way.

DebateEvolution,agkf9p,IsaacBarco12,,t2_2ybvnyav,self.DebateEvolution,,A variety of approaches to the effect of the Origin of Species on the relationship between religion and science- which do you find most compelling- debate,"Hi folks I have started writing a blog on Theology, Philosophy and Science available here for all interested in these topics: https://theologyphilosophyscience.blogspot.com/ Here is one of my posts on approaches to the effect of the Origin of Species on the relationship between religion and science:

I think no book has had more perceived influence on the relationship between religion and science than Darwin's Origin of Species. What follows is a brief outline of different approaches to the Origin of Species effect on the relationship between religion and science. There is a lot of historical analysis available on these effects, this being an introduction to a variety of historical actors who you can investigate more yourself if you are interested. 

Darwin’s Origin of Species (origin) was read by historians of science, scientists, philosophers and theologians with implications for the relationship between religion and science which these specialists have spoken on. I define the theory of evolution most widely accepted today. The theory of evolution in the origin this definition is inspired by was either neutral, enhancing or conflicting in the relationship between religion and science because of the implications it has on the argument for biological design, an aspect of natural theology important in the relationship between religion and science. The non-religious who read the origin can be put into two groups: those who saw the origin as causing a conflict between religion and science due to the nature of evolution as presented in the origin as incompatible with key theological ideas leading to rejection of religion, and those who thought that the science of the origin is compatible with theology but are not religious for other reasons. 

The religious who read the origin can be put into two groups: those who rejected the origins claims on theological, scientific and philosophical grounds having either accepted Paley’s argument on the ground of the biblical view of man or re-established Paley’s argument on philosophical and scientific grounds. These religious people saw the origin as creating a conflict in the relationship between religion and science, due to its disagreement with the Paleyean notion of design which was theologically attractive. Another group of religious people saw the origin as being compatible with religious ideas, enhancing the relationship between religion and science by giving a better understanding of God’s creation. These religious people saw the origin as having refuted Paley’s design argument and the arguments made by the other religious group and vice versa. These views therefore coexisted on acceptance or rejection of Paley’s argument in the light of the origin.

The origin contains an argument for the theory of evolution via natural selection. Evolution is “the process by which different kinds of living organism are believed to have developed from earlier forms during the history of the earth” (Hornby and Deuter, 2015), and natural selection is “the process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring” (Hornby and Deuter, 2015). Darwin published the origin in 1859, and it is these ideas that influenced the relationship between religion and science. This come about as the view of an evolving biological world differed from the view at the time that God was the intervening creator of each species of life. The reason for this was that Darwin had collected scientific evidence for biological evolution, which disputed William Paley’s argument for the existence of a designer God.
In 1802 William Paley’s “Natural Theology” was published. Paley had a great education for his time in the fields of botany, zoology, and anatomy. In “Natural Theology” Paley produces an argument for design from living organisms which are complex, implying the action of a designer in nature, just as the construction of complex human objects reveal the hand of a human designer. Paley therefore thought that the appearance of design in nature, in its complexity, order and purpose can only be explained by a designer creating nature. Paley reasons this as complexity, order and purpose are identifiers of human design, so we can identify design in other areas in the same way. To demonstrate this Paley develops a watch maker analogy. The analogy is formulated in the following way: if one comes across a watch on a heath it is reasonable to assume that it had a designer and was not created by natural forces. We think this because a watch contains many intricacies which originate from design, and by analogy we can argue that living organisms are designed as they too contain intricacies to an even greater degree. An example of design in nature Paley gives is that “there is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for vision, as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it” (Gregory, 2009 pp 602-611). Paley’s argument was developed to further make the relationship between religion and science complimentary, science producing evidence for the existence of God which fit with the Biblical view of creation. 

Charles Darwin read and praised Paley’s work however after his publication of the origin he wrote in his autobiography “the old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered"" (Darwin and Darwin, 1893 p 87). Darwin therefore thought that the origin refuted Paley’s design argument. Richard Dawkins, a contemporary evolutionary biologist has written on this in “The Blind Watchmaker”. The title itself refers to Paley’s argument, however where Paley evidenced the need for a designer in nature Dawkins sees instead a blind process. This is because Dawkins holds that evolution via natural selection is a blind process which creates the mere appearance of design in living organisms, rather than evidence for design itself. As Dawkins puts it “biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose” (Dawkins, 1996 p 1). To say that evolution is a blind process means that it is unguided, with no foresight or goal. This entails that there is no design in evolution via natural selection and that it is a wholly natural process, replacing the argument of Paley’s for a mindful, purposeful designer of natural organisms (Coyne, 2011). Dawkin’s developed this argument to demonstrate that the origin refuted the Paleyean notion of design which created a conflict in the relationship between religion and science as it removed the need for a creator of life, which allows one to reject religion and accept science. 

Samuel Wilberforce was an English bishop in the Church of England in the nineteenth Century, who agreed with the view of Dawkins that evolution as presented in the origin was incompatible with religion. The reason for this was because Darwin applied natural selection to man as well as the animals around him. This caused issue with Wilberforce as he saw such a notion as incompatible with the Bibles view of mans moral and spiritual condition. Mans ruling of the earth, mans power of speech, reason, free-will and responsibility, mans fall and redemption, the incarnation, the indwelling spirit are all seen as incompatible with man not being distinct from the animals, being an animal himself. Furthermore, Wilberforce took the origin to be incompatible with Gods providence to intervene in nature, for creation is a result of the mind of God, a view which the origin dishonours (Wilberforce, 1860). Such a critique was done to demonstrate that the origin was incompatible with the Biblical view of man and creation which means that the origins scientific argument cannot be incorporated into natural theology creating a conflict between religion and science as there will be those who take the origin to be science and reject religion on its basis and those who do not take the origin to be science or don’t engage with science on the grounds of the Bible and potentially refuted natural theology. 

Asa Gray a nineteenth century Botanist disagreed with Wilberforce’s views of the origin. Gray started his natural theology with a belief in God, seeing design in nature because of the belief in a designer, design in nature being evidence from God (Miles, 2012). Contemporary historian of science T. Russel Hunter has claimed Gray gave examples such as the human eye as clearly giving evidence of design due to the way they adapt to the condition of existence, it not mattering if it come from an act of design or a natural process. It is in this point that Gray disagrees with Paley’s design argument, as inference to design is solely in the existence and observation of intricacies in nature regardless of how it comes about. As such Darwin’s theory did not do away with the existence of the all-powerful creator, rather natural laws such as natural selection which govern the production of nature add to the conclusion that God exists. For Gray the creator who bought into existence designed natural laws which bought about nature was a new level of creation, not destroying the design hypothesis, rather enhancing it (Hunter 2012 p966-969). In doing so Gray sought to utilise an acceptance of the origin to inform how God created life, a notion leading to rejection of the Paleyean view of biological design, the science of the origin taking its place, creating enhancement between religion and science in the process.

A God that designed natural laws which gave rise to the natural world has been used by contemporary cell and molecular biologist Kenneth Miller. Miller has engaged extensively in contemporary debate on the notion of biological design as a way of helping preserve what he took to be good science and theology. Miller drew on Thomas Aquinas who claimed that when it is demonstrated that something in the natural world has a natural cause it does not take God out of the picture because God is the author of the natural world. The natural world is therefore a part of God’s providential plan. For Miller evolution is a natural process which is part of this providential plan, and furthermore demonstrates God’s grandeur in creating. This is because God does not have to constantly violate the created natural laws, by supernaturally intervening in the natural world to create (Miller, 2009).It is because of this Miller rejects Paleyean notion of biological design, promoting scientific investigation as a way of informing the religious view of creation in its place, the science of the origin enhancing the relationship between religion and science by this means. 

Peter Bowler a contemporary historian of biology has proposed an idealist concept of design somewhat like Miller’s seeking to make the relationship between the science of the origin and the natural theology of religion compatible by having a design argument which fits with the argument for evolution in the origin. This is because argument draws from the overall pattern of creation, rather than the adaptation of individual species to their environment. Bowler sees Paley’s argument as utilitarian as it emphasised the utility of each characteristic as it helped species adapt to their environment. Each creature therefore reflects the creators purpose for that creature the purpose a reflection of its design. This differs from the idealist concept of design as there is an overall plan, rather than dealing with individual species an example to demonstrate this being the fossil record. Where the Paleyean would see the design of certain species with certain characteristics in the fossil record the idealist would see a progressive unfolding of a structured plan of creation. Pre-Darwinian nineteenth century biologist Lois Agassiz argued the history of vertebrate life contains a pattern of development which led to the human form. Furthermore, Agassiz held to recapitulation theory, which claimed that embryological development and the progression of life have the same plan (Bowler 1977 pp 29-43). Bowler engages with this argument to demonstrate that the science of the origin can be accepted alongside a Christian view of creation which draws on natural theology. In doing so the relationship between the science of the origin and religion is neutral, there not being a conflict as God could use evolution to create. This leads to a rejection of the Paleyean notion of biological design, an idealist notion proposed in its place. Bowler holds that the origin is compatible with religion but is not religious. 

Paley and Darwin had different views of natural theology to these, which are reflected in Darwin’s own opinions of the effects of the origin on the relationship between religion and science. Darwin aligned with the Paleyean view of design, going from design in nature to a belief in God, design therefore being evidence for the existence of God (Miles, 2012). Because Darwin held that Paley’s argument had been refuted by the origin, he saw conflict between the science of the origin and the natural theology of the religious. This is disputed by contemporary thinkers who claim the origin has been refuted by post Darwin developments in biology, which have allowed for the re-establishment of Paley’s design argument. This group have come to be known as advocates of Intelligent Design (ID). 

ID theorists re-established Paley’s argument via complex biochemical machines. Biochemist Michael Behe was behind this in his arguments for ID, in the form of appearance of design and ‘irreducible complexity’ (ICY) in systems. Behe says that “design is simply the purposeful arrangement of parts” (Behe 1996 p 193). He claimed a biochemical system which demonstrated this is the bacterial flagellum. The bacterial flagellum is an outboard motor that bacteria use to swim. To achieve this function, it has several parts which are ordered to that effect, a motor, a rotor, a stator, a bearing, a u-joint, and a propeller, the parts ordered for a purpose, so design can be inferred (Luskin, 2008). Like Paley Behe goes from the appearance of design in nature to the claim that there is design, however he also challenges Darwinian evolution by adding an extra argument for the inference of ID which he coined ICY. In the origin Darwin claims “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down” (Darwin 1860 p 189). This allowed for Darwin’s theory to be falsified and it is in Behe’s argument for the existence of ‘irreducibly complex’ (IC) systems that this challenge is met. 

To demonstrate ICY Behe used an analogy of a mousetrap. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. For the mousetrap to work all the parts need to be in place for it to function, as the removal of any one part destroys the function of the mousetrap. Behe claims that the bacterial flagellum is the same, that if one was to remove a part of the motor or u-joint of the flagellum as examples it would no longer be able to swim and would die. This poses a problem to Darwin’s theory as it entails that the entirety of the bacterial flagellum must be in place before it can function, and evolution needs function for there to be modification. From the appearance of design and IC systems Behe claimed to have demonstrated that design can be inferred, and the origin refuted, creating complimentary reconciliation between religion and science as he provided scientific evidence for the existence of God, at the same time as removing potential conflict (Behe 1996).

These are just some of the responses that have arisen on the relationship between religion and science within the origin, if you enjoyed reading this YouTube is as a great resource to listen to people like Kenneth Miller, Richard Dawkins and Michael Behe on these questions and suggest as reading Peter Bowler's ""Monkey Trials and Gorilla Sermons: Evolution and Christianity from Darwin to Intelligent Design"".

DebateEvolution,aft2kx,Gutsick_Gibbon,,t2_1cf6yh,self.DebateEvolution,,Any Challenge to Evolutionary Theory Must Also Challenge the Antiquity of the Earth which is Impossible due to Modern Laws of Physics,"  Most challenges to the age of the Earth (4.8 bya) come from Young Earth Creationists who argue that the Earth is some 6000 years  old, and explain the geologic column by the Noachian Deluge (Noah's Ark). The problem with this lies in the nature of many of the geologic processes, which release heat, According to YEC's we must then cram 4.8 billion years into 6000 years, which creates massive issues no current Creationist can account for.

Where did all the heat go? If the geologic record was deposited in a year , then the events it records must also have occurred within a year, which as previously mentioned, creates issues with heat dispersal. 

\- **Subduction (a mechanism to explain rapid continental drift)** John Baumgardner created the runaway subduction model, which proposes that the pre-Flood lithosphere (ocean floor), being denser than the underlying mantle, began sinking. The heat released in the process decreased the viscosity of the mantle, so the process accelerated catastrophically. All the original lithosphere became subducted; the rising magma which replaced it raised the ocean floor, causing sea levels to rise and boiling off enough of the ocean to cause 150 days of rain. When it cooled, the ocean floor lowered again, and the Flood waters receded. Sedimentary mountains such as the Sierras and Andes rose after the Flood by isostatic rebound. \[Baumgardner, 1990a

The main difficulty of this theory is that it admittedly doesn't work without miracles. \[Baumgardner, 1990a, 1990b\] The thermal diffusivity of the earth, for example, would have to increase **10,000 fold** to get the subduction rates proposed \[Matsumura, 1997\], and miracles are also necessary to cool the new ocean floor and to raise sedimentary mountains in months rather than in the millions of years it would ordinarily take.

Baumgardner estimates a release of **10\^28 joules** from the subduction process. **This is more than enough to boil off all the oceans**. In addition, Baumgardner postulates that the mantle was much hotter before the Flood (giving it greater viscosity); that heat would have to go somewhere, too.

\- **Magma.** The geologic record includes roughly 8 x 10\^24 grams of lava flows and igneous intrusions. Assuming (conservatively) a specific heat of 0.15, this magma would release 5.4 x 10\^27 joules while cooling 1100 degrees C. In addition, the heat of crystallization as the magma solidifies would release a great deal more heat.

\- **Limestone formation**. There are roughly 5 x 10\^23 grams of limestone in the earth's sediments \[Poldervaart, 1955\], and the formation of calcite releases about 11,290 joules/gram \[Weast, 1974, p. D63\]. **If only 10%** of the limestone were formed during the Flood, the 5.6 x 10\^26 joules of heat released would be enough to boil the flood waters.

\- **Meteorite impacts**. Erosion and crustal movements have erased an unknown number of impact craters on earth, but Creationists Whitcomb and DeYoung suggest that cratering to the extent seen on the Moon and Mercury occurred on earth during the year of Noah's Flood. The heat from just one of the largest lunar impacts released an estimated 3 x 10\^26 joules; the same sized object falling to earth would release even more energy. \[Fezer, pp. 45-46\]

5.6 x 10\^26 joules is enough to heat the oceans to boiling. 3.7 x 10\^27 joules will vaporize them completely. Since steam and air have a lower heat capacity than water, the steam released will quickly raise the temperature of the atmosphere over 1000 C. At these temperatures, much of the atmosphere would boil off the Earth.

Aside from losing its atmosphere, Earth can only get rid of heat by radiating it to space, and it can't radiate significantly more heat than it gets from the sun unless it is a great deal hotter than it is now. (It is very nearly at thermal equilibrium now.) If there weren't many millions of years to radiate the heat from the above processes, the earth would still be unlivably hot.

**If all of the above required events were to occur in a single year,** ***not even including*** **the required radiometric decay which would also have to be crammed into 6000 years, the number of joules released is 1.626 X 1028.**

**This number can be divided by TWENTY-FIVE and STILL boil the oceans at 6.504 X 1026.**

TLDR: You cannot attempt to dismantle evolution from a standpoint that is already deeply flawed from a physics standpoint: 6000 years cannot handle all the heat release so Adam and Eve would've been sweating.

SCIENCE, , MATH, HISTORY, AND PHILOSOPHICAL 

&amp;#x200B;

Science = Impericle Evidence(Science you can test for yourself; that you see)

\- Scientist are biased when doing impericle evidence because of their pre-conceived belief of what they were taught in schools. 

\-Evolution is not something you see therefore it is not Impericle Evidence

\-You can see something that evolves, changes, or transition, but 

You can't see something that evolves beyond it's scope and level, where it transforms into a total different kind of creature/organism. It's just not how it works

The only way it can transform into another creature/organism is through INTELLIGENT DESIGN

If you naturally leave it a lone, It violates the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics

\^ What is 2ndLT, it is the law of Entropy

&amp;#x200B;

ENTROPY, IN SHORT - meaning Everything fall a parts, decay

Therefore If you leave Evolution by itself with Nature, Entropy will be in play. 

In the video it shows

\- The odds of evolution is beyond impossible

\- If you go to a human geneticist today, and ask them is the human population genetically degrading today. They will universally say YES!

 \- If you go by the standard evolutionist timeline, we would be extinct a long time ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

LONG MEANING/EXPLANATION: 

&amp;#x200B;

It's simply means decay or disorderliness in layman's terms. This is because molecules will always move or turn to dispersed to their most stable state ie. From unstable (organised) to more stable form when left alone. Molecules themselves do not form complex, structured entities when left by themselves, but rather they disintegrate, rust, rot or break down. FYI energy and matter are interchangeable, so entropy doesn't only refer to energy but matter too as well.

The universe is an isolated system, the earth is part of the universe, hence taking the universe as a whole, evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. Since evolution states that entropy decreases over time in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

If we go by the assumption that the earth is not part of the universe(an isolated system), hence its an open system, there is no way the sun's energy could have reduced the entropy of the universe in the absence of chlorophyll plant life which according to evolutionists we're not in existence at the beginning.﻿

&amp;#x200B;

Living things are open systems because they can exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. However, increased order into an open system can only occur if certain conditions are met. Order can only be produced in an open system when it contains pre-existing information in the mechanism. In other words, it needs the presence of an ordered producing machine, which contains a program for converting the undirected energy in such a way that the low entropy distribution is formed. For example, if the small inner space of a refrigerator with low temperatures imports electrical energy from outside then it will cool down the air within the refrigerator while warming up the air outside the refrigerator. In this way, low entropy distribution is produced. Higher order has emerged by the import of electrical energy into the open system. However, without the complex mechanism of the refrigerator the process would not have taken place, even with an unlimited amount of energy. Living organisms are further examples of open systems which can produce order when energy is supplied but only when the living organism contains pre-existing information in the mechanism. A plant has the mechanism of photosynthesis which takes the Sun's energy and converts it to energy for growth. Green leaves convert carbon dioxide and water molecules into oxygen and complex carbon hydrates. This entropy decrease (disorder to order) will never take place, even if the entire energy of the sun was available, unless the complicated photosynthesis mechanism pre-exists in the chloroplast of the leaves. It must already contain the information in the mechanism for order to be produced. Is it enough to export energy from the Sun to obtain complex order out of disorder? The answer is No! It is not enough to import energy from the Sun. The condition for an open system like living organisms must contain information in the mechanism for the order to be produced. When energy is switched on nothing new will emerge unless ordered information already exists before the process starts. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that order turns into disorder. Evolution claims that disordered molecules can eventually turn into specifically complex ordered molecules. Evolution is excluded from the open system condition because it does not contain the pre-existing information in the mechanism for order to be produced. It doesn't matter how much of the Sun's energy you add, you cannot get functional complexity when there is the absence of pre-existing programs, information or machines. You have to have an intelligent mind or a programmed machine imposing order on matter. Matter never spontaneously forms codes and programs from nothing. Where did the information, codes and machinery in our biological systems come from? The only logical answer is from an intelligent mind imposing order on matter. In addition, random chance follows in the direction of more disorder. Therefore, evolution contradicts the Second Law of Thermodynamics.﻿

&amp;#x200B;

The 2ndLT does not prevent life from forming, it just makes it EXTREMELY UNLIKELY(MATHMATICALLY UNLIKELY), and from the odds we see, it is rather safe to call it IMPOSSIBLE by mere chance. Even to not such extreme odds of life forming, if dye was put in a glass of water at room temp, the dye can all form and spell the word CELL. The 2ndLT does not prevent it from doing that simple act. Will it do it, it's unlikely because there is no inner machine to constrain the dye to make it spell CELL and the dye will take its most likely path and blend in all over the water, which it does. 

&amp;#x200B;

HISTORY:

History demands Christianity to be true, no other religion that has historical evidence compared to the bible. 

EXAMPLES: 

\-The new testament agrees with 90% of the 5,000+ Greek Manuscripts made.

\-Israel, how is Israel still around? They been destroyed so many times over and over. How is their culture and language still here? All other cultures in the times of Israel is gone.

\-Alexander the Great

\- Siege of Tyre

&amp;#x200B;

PHILOSOPHICAL - Common sense to every day life

&amp;#x200B;

When we see a complicated creation/design. Do we take that as something that can naturally come to be, nothing created it, or a intelligent person did it.

PROPHECY

&amp;#x200B;

The bible has predicted many things in the bible that came true, He also has a lot of predictions of the future. I will only show a few examples of them but they're are many others. 

Revelation 11:9 KJV

And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

\^ In end times - ""NATIONS SHALL SEE THEIR BODIES"" this is only possible through TV/internet

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2 Timothy 3:1-2 KJV 1

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

\^ this is obviously instagram, snapchat, tiktok, facebook, pininterest, etc. We are near end times.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people choose not to believe in God because of their own PERSONAL DESIRES. It gives them freedom from God's rules. For that many will not accept it. If it were all TRUE then your whole life would drastically change and people want to do what THEY WANT. Not what God wants. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you gotten this far. I ask you guys to put a little faith in God, that he sent his son Jesus to die for our sins. If you say you believe this with all your heart. YOU WILL HAVE ETERNAL SALVATION. WHAT DO YOU GUYS HAVE TO LOSE?

John 3:16 

""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

DebateEvolution,afderf,HmanTheChicken,,t2_dak76sj,self.DebateEvolution,,What epistemic justification could a Christian have for believing in evolution?,"The sub is not for debating religion in of itself, so I'll try to avoid going through that. But, let's say someone believes they have good evidence that Christianity is true. Let's say they find the arguments for the Resurrection (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_Db4RwZ_M https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8lkuuhVkOI) very compelling, and they are fairly certain about Christianity. The more they look into it, the more it becomes a real truth in their lives. 

I'm not a Protestant, but Martin Luther's distinction between the Magisterial and Ministerial use of reason seems to be pretty valid: 

&gt;&gt;""What then is the role of argument and evidence in knowing Christianity's truth? I’ve already said that the fundamental way in which we know the truth of Christianity is through the self-authenticating witness of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the only role that is left for argument and evidence to play is a subsidiary role. Here I think Martin Luther correctly distinguished between what he called the magisterial and the ministerial uses of reason. What are these? The magisterial role of reason occurs when reason stands over and above the Gospel like a magistrate and judges its truth or falsity on the basis of argument and evidence. By contrast, the ministerial use of reason occurs when reason submits to and serves the Gospel message. In light of the Holy Spirit’s witness, I would say that only the ministerial use of reason is legitimate. Philosophy is rightly the handmaid of theology. Reason is a God-given tool to help us better understand and defend our faith; as St. Anselm put it, ours is a faith that seeks understanding. A person who knows that Christianity is true on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit may also have a sound apologetic which reinforces for him the truth of what the Holy Spirit says. We can imagine a person who has both the witness of the Holy Spirit and good arguments from natural theology and Christian evidences for the great truths of the Gospel. This person can be said to have a kind of dual warrant for the truth of his Christian beliefs. Such a person is doubly warranted in his Christian belief in the sense that he has two sources of warrant for what he believes which are independent of each other.""

From William Lane Craig - https://www.reasonablefaith.org/podcasts/defenders-podcast-series-3/s3-excursus-on-natural-theology/excursus-on-natural-theology-part-3/

So let's say that they accept this distinction, and really, that distinction seems to follow from God's nature. Then they also say that Biblical inerrancy and some form of Scriptural perspicuity is a foundational doctrine of Christianity that cannot be judged with the ministerial use of reason. Obviously evolution contradicts the plain reading of the Bible, and if they say that the plain reading of the Bible is infallible, they wouldn't really be able to be justified in believing in evolution. 

At this point, that is my reasoning for disbelieving in evolution - and really for going toward belief in a Young Earth. I'm happy to accept that the scientific evidence for evolution and an old earth is fairly good, but, a Christian's starting point should be God and His word, not human scientific theories. Ken Ham's usual ""where you there?"" question in of itself is kind of pointless. No we weren't there, and so if that's what's necessary to justify your side, nobody can be right. We can look backwards at the past. The question has to be which witness you use for that. For a Christian, how can they be justified in believing in evolution? The witness that we should use, God, seems to have no knowledge of evolution. 

Going a bit from philosophy of science/theology/epistemology to science itself, isn't it true that science will start off with axioms and that the axioms determine the result? Why would evolution being false or even a Young Earth be a bad set of axioms if God is your epistemic starting point?

DebateEvolution,aeauxd,ThurneysenHavets,MA Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,Question,What falsifiable predictions does evolution make about the sequence of fossils?,"I was reading Coyne’s WEIT today and he repeatedly makes the strong claim that fossils are *never* found chronologically ""in the wrong place"", in evolutionary terms.

Given that there's such a thing as collateral ancestry, however, and that collateral ancestry could *in theory* explain any discrepancy from the expected order (anything could be a ""sister group"" if it's not an ancestor), does palaeontology really make ""hard"" predictions about when we should or should not find a certain fossil? Isn't it rather a matter of statistical tendencies, a “broad pattern”? And if so, how can the prediction be formulated in an objective way?

So for instance, Shubin famously predicted that he would find a transitional fossil between amphibians (365mn years and later) and fish (385mn years ago), which lived between 385 to 365mn years ago. But was he right to make that prediction so specifically? What about the fossil record makes it inconceivable that amphibians were just too rare to fossilise abundantly before this point, and that the transitional fossil actually lived much earlier?

We now know (or have good reason to suspect) that [he was wrong](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/the-tracks-of-a-ghost/). Tiktaalik remains, of course, fantastic evidence for evolution and it certainly is *roughly* in the right place, but the validation of the highly specific prediction as made by Shubin was a coincidence. Am I right to say this?

Tl;dr: People often seem to make the strong claim that fossils are *never* found in a chronologically incorrect place. *In exact terms*, what does that mean?

A bit about me. Raised as a Christian in a Christian household. I was taught the literal story of creation as laid out in Genesis. I have heard the evidence for a global flood and young earth (6000 or less years). Through this process, I have also been informed of the arguments against the theory of evolution. That is, that all life originated from a single cell organism some 4 billion years ago. 

I still believe in literal creationism. I believe the arguments that I have been taught in support of creationism and in opposition to evolution make sense.

Needless to say I was not impressed his empty argument. 

Starting with the null hypotheses that we don’t know anything about the historical (and in that case future) rates of processes. We must look at the evidence as to what the rate of processes has been doing. We do evidence from [Astronomical spectroscopy]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy), that these rates have been consistent. We also have more terrestrial evidence that uniformitarianism is the most likely scenario, namely the Okla reactors in Gabon, and also comparing fossil assemblages to multiple dating techniques.  I’m sure I’m missing some great examples, so feel free to educate me, preferably with peer reviewed journal articles. 

How to impress me with criticism of widely accepted theories:

Before we start, let’s be very clear, the number of people who accept a theory has no relevance for it’s accuracy (argumentum ad populum), for example evolution is not very likely accurate because most people believe it best explains the biodiversity we see today, but because of how many independent lines of study support the theory.  

First, when attacking a theory, or more likely when it comes to evolution, part of a theory, please explain that you understand the evidence for the theory, and if you disagree with a piece of evidence, explain why you don’t think the evidence in valid. Without this step, your attack is invalid, as you must understand something to understand explain why it is wrong. 

Example: often see the claim that earth’s magnetosphere is weakening. Yet the people who argue that it’s going to decline to zero neglect to explain why we see the zebra stripes in the oceanic rock formed by the reversal of the magnetic pole recorded when the oceanic crust cooled below it’s curie temperature. Don't be dishonest when forming your argument.

Secondly you must explain why the evidence better fits your idea than the current model.

Example: Long before Einstein proposed the theory of relativity, it was clear the Kepler’s laws of motion broke down under certain situations. Yet as this was the best theory we had, it was used until Einstein resolved the issues. His theory is still being tested today. 

Finally if discussing something such as a change the rate of processes believed to be constant, you must propose a mechanism for the change to occur. 

Example: Germ theory.


That’s it, just three steps. However without those three steps, I personally see no reason at all to take your argument seriously at all.  

Back to the topic of uniformitarianism for a brief moment.  I really don’t understand the idea that uniformitarianism supports ideas such as accelerated decay rates supports the biblical version of creation. In order to convince me that’s true, you have to show evidence that the rates changed, the mechanism of change, and of course explain where the heat went etc. etc. etc. 

Assuming for a second that uniformitarianism is incorrect, I don't see a point of continuing on with science until we can understand that drives the changes in the rates of processes. 

I look forward to hearing any criticism of my view on this.

DebateEvolution,abjckr,ThurneysenHavets,MA Linguistics,t2_20md25aj,self.DebateEvolution,,The “linguistic entropy” argument for a young earth (and some reasons why it’s crap),"A rather fun creationist argument I’ve come across a few times now runs roughly as follows.

&gt;Languages tend to simplify over time (e.g. English lost much of its case inflection). This means languages were more complex in the past. Since the mainstream scientific view is that languages (at some point in time) evolved from *less* complex precursors, this is unexpected from an evolutionary point of view. However, it is perfectly compatible with a supernatural event, like the Tower of Babel, where languages were created in their full complexity which subsequently degenerated.

This is an argument one might term “linguistic entropy”, by analogy with the genetic argument this sub is all too familiar with. Predictably, it's nonsense. I’ll try and keep it short. There are three main problems with the argument.

&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, *loss of inflection* is not the same as *simplification*. It is easy to conceive of, and find examples of, analytical (non-inflecting) languages which make more grammaticalized distinctions in a given paradigm than many synthetic (inflecting) languages. That is the kind of metric of complexity which is used in the peer-reviewed literature. If creationists want to use a different metric of complexity they need to state what that metric is and why it makes sense to prefer it.

&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, we have numerous examples of languages gaining inflection and a good understanding of how this happens. [E.g. for case endings](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklinguistics/comments/a56xq7/how_do_languages_develop_noun_cases/ebkklb6/). At best, therefore, creationists can claim that languages drift towards analyticity only as a weak *tendency*. In which case they need to provide statistically significant evidence for the existence of such a tendency. Usually, they don’t get beyond cherry-picked examples of case loss, almost invariably from western European languages.

The European bias makes the argument particularly unconvincing when one considers that many inflectional categories like case and gender are known to be strongly areal (viz. influenced by the presence or absence of such categories in neighbouring languages). So limiting your sample to the European linguistic area tells you something about tendencies in the European linguistic area, not tendencies in language generally. Kind of basic, really.

There’s various other sample biases in the creationist arguments I’ve seen but I won’t go into that here.

&amp;nbsp;

Thirdly, gain of inflection is probably harder to observe than loss of inflection. Inflection is gained through a very gradual process of grammaticalisation that might not easily be recognised as such, particular by a linguistically naive researcher ^(cough definitely nobody at CMI cough). The loss of a case marker is very obvious. So observing a slight statistical bias towards inflection loss is likely to be an artefact of observation even if creationists did succeed in controlling for all relevant variables.

DebateEvolution,aambbb,JazzAvenue,,t2_o3z1u,self.DebateEvolution,,Do evolutionists have answers for these (Evolutionists only),"Hey, I was taught in school but I'm still very ignorant of evolution, or more precisely the methodology and evidence for it. Was wondering what the pro evolution answers are for these questions

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout history, people have discovered fossils of extinct species, but why are the missing links not found in abundance, if they inhabited the earth for long lengths of time?

&amp;#x200B;

We can presume the age of a fossil based on the layers of the earth, considering the way the earth changes landscapes over time, how accurate is this method, and what different methods are used to determine the age of a fossil aside from carbon dating

&amp;#x200B;

How do you tackle the entropy argument and how strong/weak an argument is it from your perspective?

&amp;#x200B;

It would take too long to observe evolution in person, but is their evidence that its possible to edit the DNA of an organism, into something different, and still have said creature be capable of sustaining and reproducing life, if not with a complex organism, at least with a micro organism. Or is their any evidence of non complex organisms developing into complex organisms.

&amp;#x200B;

Not about evolution, but are there any alternative theories on the development of life, outside evolution? Excluding creationism, I mean before Darwin, did people have other theories?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance folks!

DebateEvolution,a7o2iw,gminor1025,,t2_7yurg4q,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolutionism believers must be consistent.,"I have a lot of scientific issues with Evolutionism but I want to talk about one in particular. Supporters of this belief inherently believe life, as we know it today, is a result of natural processes, and the genetic information comes from those, NOT, an intelligent designer. So, if your scientific hypothesis says there is no intelligent designer, you must admit, you also believe there was no such designer for the Universe's existence or the abiogenesis part of Evolution. I suppose you don't specifically have to believe in the Big Bang, but am I correct to assume that most of you do? So before you can honestly stand behind naturalistic explanations for evolution, you have to hold those same premises when explaining the parts that precede it. I recognize that I have some bias, but I can't get around believing the universe was a singularity when science clearly says they don't explode, they only emit Hawking radiation over time. And how would spacetime expand, when even non-universal scale singularities bend spacetime inwards. How did the big bang create time? Because in order for spacetime to expand, time must be created also, due to causality. Unless you believe that time exists outside of spacetime somehow. If spacetime didn't exist, then how would an explosion occur when an explosion itself requires time. Black holes are stated to be stars that were too large and can only implode, but at a certain point, they're large enough that they go back to exploding? Abiogenesis and Evolution require ridiculous amounts of time, yet all of the ""evidence"" of the age of the earth and the universe is based on assumptions about the past which can not be empirically proven. Evolution attempts to explain new sources of genetic information, but all of the empirical evidence proves Genetic Entropy, which is a loss of information. I can't produce empirical proof for Intelligent Design, I admit that, but I find plenty of empirical evidence that refutes Evolutionism. Yet I have not seen any empirical proof that refutes Intelligent Design. Will Evolutionists ever admit that their belief of ""no intelligent designer"" across the origin of the universe, abiogenesis, and evolution is in fact based more on faith and theories, rather than empirical evidence?

DebateEvolution,a79y4g,OddJackdaw,,t2_66vsowc,self.DebateEvolution,,"Some of the most flagrant quote mining I've ever seen, from our beloved Sal Cordova.","In the discussion [here, ](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a70t3v/best_proevolution_video_for_kids/) /u/stcordova linked to a [blog post](https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/two-faced-nick-matzke/) where he says this:

&gt; Did a creationist actually say this?

&gt;&gt; phylogenetic methods as they exist now can only rigorously detect sister-group relationships, not direct ancestry,

&gt; No, it was Nick Matzke at Panda’s thumb 🙂

&gt; But a creationist did say:

&gt;&gt; you get sister groups with no parent explicitly shown.

&gt; Platonic forms do not suggest we evolved from fish

&gt; 😯

&gt; Not much difference between what Matzke said and I said! I’ve been telling him that since 2006, and now he finally acknowledges it publicly.

Notice anything funny about the punctuation and capitalization of those quotes? Yep, Sal is not just taking sentence or paragraph out of context, he is literally pulling a sentence fragment out to misrepresent what the author was saying. 

This is the actual paragraph that was taken from, with the quote highlighted:

&gt; As with all creationists, Meyer exhibits no understanding of the fact that **phylogenetic methods as they exist now can only rigorously detect sister-group relationships, not direct ancestry**, and, crucially, that this is neither a significant flaw, nor any sort of challenge to common ancestry, nor any sort of evidence against evolution. Distinguishing between a close sister-group relationship and an exact ancestor is just a level of precision that we cannot expect in most cases. It’s just a by-product of the method and the data available. (This is not quite the end of the discussion on this topic – eventually, we will have Bayesian methods that will assign probabilities to hypotheses of direct ancestry, although this will require formal definition and then data-informed estimation of what “ancestral lineage” means in terms of morphological variability within a lineage, the biogeographic and stratigraphic range of “morphospecies” through times, etc. End nerdy sidetrack.) But phylogenetic methods can and do regularly and rigorously identify collateral ancestry – sister group relationships, and ancestral grades and clades. We can say that birds descend from dinosaurs with essentially 100% statistical confidence, without knowing which if any currently-described fossils are exact direct ancestors rather than closely-related sister groups.

And here is the paragraph containing the quote of Sal's that he cites:

&gt; So you can take a bird as the common ancestor of all mammals and fish. That’s exactly the problem. Whereas, the unspecified vertebrate unifies the vertebrates in the most natural way.

&gt; That’s why the transformed cladists got into hot water — they saw all the similarities, grouped them together (like I did above) and you get sister groups with no parent explicitly shown. It seems the “parent” was a common design from the mind of an intelligence, and the grouping actually preclude notions of a transitional. The fossil record doesn’t contain believable transitionals because the were none.

It is true that if you take that single sentence fragment out of the context *of the rest of the freaking sentence*, there's ""not much difference between what Matzke and [Sal] said."" 

On the other hand, if you read what the two authors *actually* said, you end up with two people saying *very* different things. Even from the sentence alone it is clear that he disagrees with Sal's interpretation, and with the entire paragraph quoted he explains in detail why Sal is wrong. 

Now that blog post is more than 5 years old... I normally wouldn't shame someone for saying something stupid that long ago. But as he continues to cite it as supporting his position, it seems worth pointing out how flagrantly dishonest he remains.

It's now easy for you to see what I visioned as a way to prevent the r/IntelligentDesign sub from being turned into another phony discussion forum. Soon after joining Reddit I discovered that name was unusable then I left it at that, with no complaints. It at least did not need covering.

Thanks to Sal's digging of the foundation work for something new there is now my example to show what being scientifically responsible looks like, to contrast what Reddit management needs to beware of and may help needing to control by having a good example you can approve of too. For that reason I very much welcome your opinion/review of the description and rules that go with the theory I currently have. The greater the contrast the quicker the tinfoil hats can be awarded to those who prove to deserve them.

In my sub I welcome all to help develop a real scientific theory, instead of bait then switch to books and videos to buy and study that have no scientific theory in them just claims that one is possible or already exists but is being suppressed by ""evolutionists"". Holding the Discovery Institute to their word in regards to ""scientific theory"" and my not being concerned by ""historical sciences"" being mixed in their text makes them look good, even though all who represent them are expected to be visibly absent from the serious development of their own theory. It's there not necessary for me to say a single word about the politics of the situation, there is just a starter theory and a couple of easy rules to follow.

Sal got what he wanted, and so did I. The moral lesson in \[King Nothing\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5j8lz4oD4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5j8lz4oD4Q)) thus play's on again, for at least one of us. But I'm confident that my new crown will not go to my head. It is after all just another Reddit forum. Being true to the common sense rules that must exist there demands that all ""Charles Darwin said"" type arguments that already fill your forum anyway might seem ruthless for me to immediately delete on sight, but that does not belong in a IDTheory forum and will not be tolerated. If someone is at least trying to explain something useful then I will help them out and recommend other places for further advice that makes what they posted worth the extra effort on their part, be proud of.

DebateEvolution,a2ryet,CTR0,BS | Biology | Genetics and Synthetic Biology,t2_99a5p,self.DebateEvolution,,Human Germline Engineering vs Evolutionary Effects,"As I'm sure you're all aware, this past week or so has had some [interesting developments in the discussions of human germline engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui). I'd like to talk about the subject as it pertains to evolution.

**THESIS**: Human germline engineering as a precaution against lifetime infection is not productive for our species. Responsible engineering to prevent genetic diseases and change canonical cosmetic differences would be at a minimum harmless from an evolutionary perspective.

Realistically speaking, there's four purposes for which the human genome could be engineered.

* Prevent otherwise inevitable genetic diseases (Marfan syndrome where a parent is homozygous for it)

* Reduce likelihood of diseases of chance (BRCA1-wt and breast cancer, especially when a parent is homozygous for it)

* Reduce likelihood of genetically influenced infections (CRR5 delta-32 and HIV. This is where He_Jiankui's work stands)

* Cosmetic (Widdow's peak)

Let's stop for a moment and consider the idea that all human germline engineering is permissible, GATTACA style. **What degree of engineering is actually worthwhile, particularly in an evolutionary context?**

Obviously, even cosmetic differences can have an evolutionary effect. See the [spread of blue eyes](https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/origin-blue-eyes). I would personally disallow this class of engineering if only for the concern of eugenics (especially any mandated genetic changes) and the differences between socioeconomic classes, but we're not here for that. **Would there be any significant evolutionary concerns for genetic engineering that is more or less cosmetic?** If a trait was considered sexually attractive, would the trait not naturally increase in prevalence anyways?

Genetic engineering to fight infections, I feel, has the largest evolutionary implications. This is going to be the next antibiotic resistance problem. He Jiankui used an unstudied mutation in the CRR5 receptor (similar to the popularized delta-32 mutation) as a preventative measure against HIV where the father was HIV positive. The thing is, [we already know that there are strains of HIV that can break through delta-32 mediated resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9256936). As genetic engineering for this application gets more affordable, we will be gradually increasing the prevalence of this and like mutations to protect us against organisms with generation times 7000+ times faster than us. There are treatments to prevent HIV contraction to offspring without the use of genetic intervention, and the use as as long term 'vaccination' I feel is more or less a loosing battle in an evolutionary arms race.

I'm going to lump the two genetic disease prevention categories into one here. I think, when technology advances to the point where off target effects and mosaic effects are minimized, that this kind of engineering should be permissible. One of the interesting things about evolution is that selection is significantly less for diseases that manifest after an organism's child is raised to adulthood. For instances like BRCA1, I feel that, for the most part, we would be doing little to the evolutionary timeline outside of reducing human suffering. Similarly, in a natural situation, a debilitating genetic disease early would likely be selected against. With modern medicine, selection has been dampened. We would be acting as nature's filter without the increased chance of early death. Of course, we would have to be cautious and only edit things with clear detriments and no circumstantial benefits (I would not be a proponent of editing against Sickle Cell Anemia, for example), but it's hard to imagine situations where cancer would be beneficial to the patient.",11,1543864960,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a2ryet/human_germline_engineering_vs_evolutionary_effects/

DebateEvolution,a208fn,Sclooper,,t2_zerr1,self.DebateEvolution,,Muller's ratchet,"Hello everybody, I'm fairly new to posting on reddit so let me know if I'm doing something wrong. Anyway, I'm an evolutionary biologist and I've noticed that genetic entropy is a hot topic for creationists.  This is disturbing for a number of reasons. I find it problematic because discussion on both sides seems to ignore that genetic entropy is real, however it usually referred to as Muller's ratchet.  Sex, other means of genetic rearrangement, polyploidy and other mechanisms act to reverse the damage caused by negative mutations accumulating in a genome overtime.  In fact the presence of Muller's ratchet is one of the primary reasons sex is thought to have evolved in the first place.  My concern is why is sex ignored by proponents of genetic entropy? Why does this old topic need a new phrase to describe it, ""genetic entropy""?  Why do proponents of genetic entropy ignore evidence that asexual lineages have other mechanisms to reduce the cost of negative mutation accumulation (for example, see Naito &amp; Pawlowska 2016).  I think everyone on this subreddit would benefit from reading some background on Muller's ratchet, here are some places to get started [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s\_ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet) (wikipedia I know, but its a good start for non-scientist and scientist alike), [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01266.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01266.x) (a general review) [http://www.genetics.org/content/156/4/2137.short](http://www.genetics.org/content/156/4/2137.short) ( A review on the speed that this process takes place).

It shows how just looking at the end result of a random process (bugs making it through the maze) can appear miraculous or make you think they must have been guided.

It blows away the idea that we needed a designer to create life as it is or that somehow we are fine tuned. One might guess that no bug could quickly get all the way through the maze unless it had ""intelligence"". But in fact, some do get through very quickly. Some get through slowly.

Chemistry doesn't work that way. Nothing forms by chance. Heck you can never get a caffeine or even alcohol molecule to just form in water by chance in anyway, and as soon as you did it would break apart and dilute.

Claiming four magic amino acids that even seperately just cannot form under any circumstance by chance and then survive more than a few minutes or days could somehow have 3 other amino acids and a backbone and then just replicate and create an arrangement that produces a viable life form that also somehow just had the arrangement of these four amino acids to reproduce is just insane.

Flying spaghetti monster is more scientific.

But like all other PhD's in a valid field of science, if you doubt or critique the theory you just ""don't understand the evolution"" or you simply haven't read the horrible and abysmal ""explanation"" of how abiogenesis ""DID"" happen exaxtly how evolutionists claim it did.

As you are undoubtedly aware, Answers In Genesis has now accepted speciation through natural selection as a modern solution to the age-old question, How can so many species of animals fit on the ark? Their modern solution is that only about 1000 ""created kinds"" -- roughly corresponding to families in scientific taxonomy -- of land animals were present on the ark, and that post-deluge evolution of these created kinds produced all the species we see today.

It should be mentioned that the ""created kinds"" posited by Answers In Genesis include both extant and extinct species, since they posit that no ""kinds"" of land animals were left off the ark. For instance, the ark contained many different kinds of dinosaurs, as well as kinds relating to extinct mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. It was only after the flood that these extinct ""kinds"" became fully extinct.

In addition, Answers In Genesis states that the post-deluge speciations does not depend on mutation creating new genes; all of the genes exhibited in species today were already included in the ancestral ""created kind"" included on the ark. Modern species may have lost genes through natural selection, both those ""created kinds"" on the ark had a sort of ""super genome"" that included all possible genes. For instance, the pre-flood world was populated by a ""created cat kind"" whose genome contained all the gene variants found in the modern family of Felidae, and that's what Noah let on the ark.

But these views of ""created kinds"" seems contradicted by the flood geology promoted by Answers In Genesis, in which the flood was responsible for laying down the geologic strata that we see today, and that the fossils we find in those strata are of animals that died in the flood. This seems to contradict ""created kinds"" in two ways

* Based on this, it seems like we should only find fossils of created kinds, since modern species didn't ""evolve"" until after the flood, but clearly that's not the case: for instance, we have fossils of many species of Felidae, not just a single ""created kind"", and the fossil record includes modern species. Why wouldn't the fossil record show just the ""created kind"" that modern species descended from?

* How can the fossil record include modern species descended from any ""created kind"" since Answers In Genesis says that the fossils were laid down in the flood, but the modern species didn't ""evolve"" from its kind until after the flood?",16,1543432525,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/a19ca6/how_can_created_kinds_be_consistent_with_flood/

Back then, some of the articles made their way to /r/Creation of course: [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8pg3og/massive_genetic_study_reveals_90_percent_of/) and then [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8n0dh8/results_from_study_of_mitochondrial_dna/).

You can read both threads if you want to have an overview about a) Why this paper was received with mixed opinions and b) Why articles about this paper were received negatively. But in short:

&gt; ""No, they did not find out “that 9 out of 10 animal species on the planet came to being at the same time as humans did some 100,000 to 200,000 years ago”. New species arise continuously, but they do so by going through a population bottleneck in geologically recent times. Homo sapiens arose as a distinct species between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, but that notorious London Underground mosquito may have evolved in the 18th century…which is still within the past 200,000 years, you may notice. It’s a bit like reading a statement that almost all people are less than 100 years old, and then wondering, publicly and in print, about what happened in 1918 to cause every human being on Earth to have been suddenly born in that year. That must have been some orgy to celebrate the end of the Great War.""

And why were some articles about this paper received negatively? Because for some reason, if you misunderstood the study well enough, creationists made up their mind and decided that this is a paper that actually proclaims that most if not virtually all animals (including humans) had a 2 people bottleneck at the same time.

If you thought that creationists would let go the idea of misunderstanding the concept of **Mitochondrial Eve**, then boy oh boy

/u/NesterGoesBowling:

&gt; Very cool! I saw this last night but was too tired to make a post here - thank you for sharing!

&gt; The idea here is that of all the species studied, each have a “Mitochondrial Eve” that lived about (supposedly) 200,000 years ago.

&gt; Given how the dates of about 200,000 years are calculated based on expected mutation rates (and how similar dates of the “Mitochondrial Eve” of humans can be argued to support a 6,000 year timeframe), it’s nice to see Creationist predictions being validated as science progresses (common ancestors thousands of years ago not millions). 

&gt; Common ancestors between species are still millions of years ago -- but the human common ancestor was never believed to be millions of years ago, simply as an argument of mathematics, as it only takes 33 generations to reach 6B ancestors.

Notice how this should be a satisfying answer? NOPE, because /u/NesterGoesBowling is still happily posting about it, just today as if nothing ever happened and as if it's new evidence, probably because just like most other creationists, he caught wind about it because of Fox News or Daily Mail:

Back then, some of the articles made their way to /r/Creation of course: [**Here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8pg3og/massive_genetic_study_reveals_90_percent_of/) and then [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8n0dh8/results_from_study_of_mitochondrial_dna/).

You can read both threads if you want to have an overview about a) Why this paper was received with mixed opinions and b) Why articles about this paper were received negatively. But in short:

&gt; ""No, they did not find out “that 9 out of 10 animal species on the planet came to being at the same time as humans did some 100,000 to 200,000 years ago”. New species arise continuously, but they do so by going through a population bottleneck in geologically recent times. Homo sapiens arose as a distinct species between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago, but that notorious London Underground mosquito may have evolved in the 18th century…which is still within the past 200,000 years, you may notice. It’s a bit like reading a statement that almost all people are less than 100 years old, and then wondering, publicly and in print, about what happened in 1918 to cause every human being on Earth to have been suddenly born in that year. That must have been some orgy to celebrate the end of the Great War.""

And why were some articles about this paper received negatively? Because for some reason, if you misunderstood the study well enough, creationists made up their mind and decided that this is a paper that actually proclaims that most if not virtually all animals (including humans) had a 2 people bottleneck at the same time.

If you thought that creationists would let go the idea of misunderstanding the concept of **Mitochondrial Eve**, then boy oh boy

Now comes the heavy part, apparently [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/did-a-mysterious-extinction-event-precede-adam-and-eve) wrote an opinion piece just days ago and [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6424407/Every-person-spawned-single-pair-adults-living-200-000-years-ago-scientists-claim.html) followed their steps. For whatever reason, creationists are up in arms about it AGAIN. For example here is a [**thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/a014rp/all_humans_are_descended_from_a_single_malefemale/) that now spawned in /r/TrueChristian with the dishonest title ""All humans are descended from a single male-female pair"" (check the thread for juicy drama).



and [/r/Creation even made another post about it again](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a01o0p/90_of_all_animal_species_alive_today_come_from/). Funny enough, the OP is /u/NesterGoesBowling who already participated in the same debate 6 months ago about the same topic. Another new user makes a [**submission**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a03nik/gentle_correction_to_my_creationist_brothers_and/) in /r/Creation about it titled ""A gentle correction"" and it was **downvoted** and **attacked** even though it is completely justified. Please check that [**thread**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a03nik/gentle_correction_to_my_creationist_brothers_and/) and if you have the permission to comment there, help OP out. He is 100% completely correct yet has to deal with a bottomless pit of ignorance.

To showcase the ignorance and close-mindedness of /r/Creation I wanted to focus on /u/NesterGoesBowling a bit more. Remember that I said that he had the exactly same discussion 6 months ago:

[6 month old thread that he participated in](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8n0dh8/results_from_study_of_mitochondrial_dna/)

[/u/NesterGoesBowling posts similar article 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8nespd/all_sperm_whales_had_a_mitochondrial_eve_tens_of/?st=JHUIGYL8&amp;sh=4df42714)

/u/NesterGoesBowling:

&gt; Very cool! I saw this last night but was too tired to make a post here - thank you for sharing!

&gt; The idea here is that of all the species studied, each have a “Mitochondrial Eve” that lived about (supposedly) 200,000 years ago.

&gt; Given how the dates of about 200,000 years are calculated based on expected mutation rates (and how similar dates of the “Mitochondrial Eve” of humans can be argued to support a 6,000 year timeframe), it’s nice to see Creationist predictions being validated as science progresses (common ancestors thousands of years ago not millions). 

&gt; Common ancestors between species are still millions of years ago -- but the human common ancestor was never believed to be millions of years ago, simply as an argument of mathematics, as it only takes 33 generations to reach 6B ancestors.

Notice how this should be a satisfying answer? NOPE, because /u/NesterGoesBowling is still happily posting about it, just today as if nothing ever happened and as if it's new evidence, probably because just like most other creationists, he caught wind about it because of Fox News or Daily Mail:

-&gt; [90% of all animal species alive today come from parents that all began giving birth at roughly the same time, less than 250 thousand years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/a01o0p/90_of_all_animal_species_alive_today_come_from/)

Will creationists ever stop regurgitating everything? We can only hope.

The work proper is (in brief) an intriguing comparison based on a particular mitochondrial gene, Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I, which the authors argue should be used as a means of examining species distinction.

However, the reason I want to bring this up in this particular forum is [this article.](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/did-a-mysterious-extinction-event-precede-adam-and-eve)  It was recently posted to /r/Christianity and I expect it to show up elsewhere.

DebateEvolution,9zkela,mohammadnursyamsu,,t2_2fn1s8fs,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution scientists are evil.,"To say someone is evil is to express a subjective opinion. 

I form the opinion by spontaneous expression of emotion with free will, choosing the word ""evil"". I might have chosen the word ""nice"", that would be an equally logically valid opinion.

The evolution scientists have several courses of action available to them, and, according to me, evil is what makes their choices turn out the way they do, instead of another way. 

The existence of evil is therefore a matter of chosen opinion, it is spiritual. I choose the opinion it exists. 

That's how subjectivity works, an opinion is formed with a choice, and expresses what it is that makes a choice. 

I look at the choices evolution scientists make, look at the consequences of their choices, look at what other options they had, and then I make an opinion on what the agency of their choices was. 

It's because of evolution scientists that the human spirit is not commonly acknowledged anymore in society. People don't acknowledge each other's emotions anymore because they don't understand how subjectivity works anymore. 

First the evolution scientist describes the entire life of organisms using subjective words, like that an organisms likes to survive, that it has fear, joy and whatever. Then the evolution scientist asserts that this is all factual. The evolution scientists assert subjective words as fact. 

Second the evolution scientist asserts creationism is wrong, while subjective opinion, as explained, is a creationist concept. 

So 1 and 2, it is a double slam against subjectivity, which results in particularly higher educated people having no clue about how subjectivity works, and disregarding people's emotions. Almost 100 percent of scientists accept evolution, so it basically applies to all scientists, not just evolution scientists. 

If I post on the internet about the human spirit it is certain everybody there will require evidence for this spirit thing. Nobody has a clue anymore about how subjectivity works. Certainly society has become a bad joke, where it is held to be virtue to systematically ignore people's emotions, because it is virtue to adhere to the scientific method in all cases.

The schoolbook for the Hitler Youth shows where teaching evolution science ends up. The book starts out with the title ""a factual outlook on life"", and then it proceeds to claim that the content of character of people is a factual issue of racial science. 

Evolution scientists are evil, evolution theory must be destroyed. 

Actually creationists are guilty too, because it seems I am the only creationist in the entire world teaching about subjectivity. If many creationists taught about subjectivity, then the bad influence of evolution theory would be limited. But for now creationists teach more or less the right structure of subjectivity in regards to God and the human soul, but they do not teach it in detail.

In this talk, Sanford presents a 4 point argument for his position on error catastrophe:

* Natural Selection is Constrained by Selection Interference

* Deleterious Mutations are being introduced faster than they can be removed

* Most mutations are nearly neutral, not simply neutral.

I've got quite a busy day, and I don't have time for a full breakdown of the arguments, but I'm obviously opposed to his position. I sort of alluded to this at the lecture in person during questioning, but his entire position depends on us humans starting out at a fitness of 1.

DebateEvolution,9unyh9,RibosomalTransferRNA,B.Sc. | Molecular Biology,t2_742jf5o,self.DebateEvolution,,Evidence against the theory of Universal Common Ancestry,"By /u/stcordova

1) biological systems that are unlikely to evolve for a common ancestor based on known facts.

1.a) If a Darwinist says, ""we don't know how it evolved, but it evolved"" that's saying ""we don't know"" -- that is not proof of universal common ancestry, but a statement of faith without fact.

2) At most one can say proteins obey an APPROXIMATE nested hierarchical pattern. BUT, there are lots of taxonomically restricted proteins (aka proteins missing a common ancestor), and also all of the major protein families do not have a common ancestor! OOPS!

3) Furthermore, there are mechanical issues evolving new proteins that are integrated into new systems.

I could cite some examples like:

3.1) TopoIsomerase Polymerases Eukaryotic Specific Spliceosome Proteins

The fact that Proteins Families form nested hierarchies is not an explanation of the mechanistic avenues to the formation of proteins families that have no common ancestor between the family nor does it explain the origin of things like TopoIsomerase (and its component ""-ases"" like AtpAse and Gyrase, etc.) nor polymerases.

If you can't explain this, then the theory of universal common descent is, ""we don't know how it evolved, but we BELIEVE it, we profess faith without explanation.""

4) Futhermore the organismal APPROXIMATE nested hierarchy can be defined even better with Taxnomically Restricted Features/Genes, not just protein phylogenies. Taxonomically Restricted Featrues/Genes are evidence against common descent proceeding from non-miraculous processes.",40,1541508017,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9unyh9/evidence_against_the_theory_of_universal_common/

I would like to tell you that Darwinistic evolution theory is death in my eyes. With the recent discoveries of Mudfossils. Of different humanoids, with sizes unimaginable to man. We have to ask ourselves the question again what is evolution? What is creation? and why is it that present humans lost alot of their active DNA and thus abilities. How will we get back our active dna. let me remind you, the road is long, we are not using 95% at the moment. When we have the 100% we will have great abilities and life-spans. the human body will become an perfect utencil for the spirit to travel in. and maybe, then maybe we can evolve to next steps.

DebateEvolution,9t8ge3,BRENNEJM,Evolutionist,t2_zea12,self.DebateEvolution,,r/DebateEvolution's infatuation with r/Creation,"*I understand this will probably be an unpopular opinion here, but it really needs to be said.*

I haven't been part of this sub for very long and in the short time I've been here I've seen some great posts and learned a lot. That being said, I really think r/DebateEvolution has a weird infatuation with r/Creation. I completely understand that creationism is the main ""opponent"" of evolution and, as such, it is an important topic (and fun topic) of debate in an evolution subreddit. I don't understand, though, why r/DebateEvolution users feel the need to post about r/Creation users here or ""drag them"" into posts here.

[A post here](https://new.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9pw1cl/debate_evolution_subscribers_targeting_yecs/) recently x-posted from r/Creation mentioned that users of r/Creation were being tagged in r/DebateEvolution posts simply for those users beliefs. I completely understand how annoying it can be at r/Creation if you want to post but are not allowed to due to strict/unfair rules. That doesn't mean we can tag others in posts here just so that we can debate them here. If those users want to debate here, they will post here. It's like overhearing someone at another table talking about something you don't agree with and yelling at them to join your table, just so you can shoot down their beliefs. (I'm all for shooting down beliefs, but the other person has to join the discussion willingly.)

I also realize that just because a user was tagged doesn't mean they have to join the conversation. I feel like this sub should conduct itself with more civility than Twitter though. Let's not just yell at other people in the hopes that we annoy them enough to join our conversation. (If that user has posted their beliefs here in the past though, have at it.)

In a [very recent post here](https://new.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9t68mq/rcreation_sectarian_crisis_are_days_in_genesis_i/) two users of r/Creation were called out for no reason at all. At least in that last post, users were tagged in regards to a topic somewhat evolutionary in nature. The thesis of this most recent post is literally, ""Hey Everyone! I brought the show to watch if you brought the popcorn!"" Maybe if the post offered evidence against the idea of the Genesis creation matching with the timeline of evolution, it would be on topic for this sub (but even then, there's no reason to directly tag the r/Creation users). In it's current form, it's just a gossip post; the only topic of discussion being the two r/Creation users who were tagged.

This goes against **Rule #2** of this sub: ""All posts must contain a clearly arguable claim."" There is nothing to debate in the post. There is no idea posited.

It also kind of goes against **Rule #3**: ""We are here to debate evolution, not religion."" As it stands, the only thing that mentions evolution are the posts linked to over at r/Creation. There is no new information or debate topic provided.

Sorry for the rant everyone. I was just so happy when I found this sub, but this infatuation with r/Creation and it's users really needs to stop.",88,1541070481,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9t8ge3/rdebateevolutions_infatuation_with_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,9t68mq,Dzugavili,,t2_bsswb,self.DebateEvolution,Question,/r/Creation Sectarian Crisis: Are Days in Genesis I Literal?,"I love it when two groups fight over their differing interpretations of the same invisible friend. Today, I give you a sparring match between of /r/creation's finest champions:

The days of creation cannot be interpreted as long periods of time](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9sy1nv/the_days_of_creation_cannot_be_interpreted_as/) by /u/Kanbei85

[The days of creation CANNOT be interpreted as ordinary 24 hour days](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9t35al/the_days_of_creation_cannot_be_interpreted_as/) by /u/Mike_Enders

Let's take a moment to talk about the contenders.

In the white trunks is /u/Kanbei85, a more recent arrival to /r/creation based on my limited and now legally hazy memory. My recollection is that he is a very idealistic Christian, a classic literal creationist, prone to [meltdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9p8cky/assuming_mainstream_science_and_society_at_all/e7zsgc7/) not entirely dissimilar to those seen from /u/stcordova, and [trying to evangelize](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9hprui/comparing_christian_and_vedic_creationism/e6ejuqv/). I'd say I'm insulted that he's not trying to save my soul, but I'm pretty sure I'd have a better time downstairs anyway.

In the black trunks is /u/Mike_Enders, probably the most abrasive of /r/creation's residents -- to the point of even picking this fight. Honestly, I'm susprised he's still there -- but he probably won't be soon enough, as I recall this recent thread [where he broke the echo chamber.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9oo1l6/mammals_cannot_evolve_fast_enough_to_escape/) Yeah, I read it -- I just stepped back to watch the carnage. He seems to come from an *Old Earth, Young Life* background

I encourage you to read both to get a general sense of their arguments, but the short forms as follows: Kanbei argues that God can do whatever he wants and that days are defined by periods of light and dark. Since light was made first, Earth just has to spin to define a day. Enders argues even the days are supernatural and thus could represent any amount of time, as God is creating the forces of nature itself.

Honestly, I just love seeing them go after each other for a change. What I find interesting though is that very few are arguing *against* Enders. His comments are nearly empty. Meanwhile, Kanbei's is pretty much a circlejerk:

&gt;The greatest Biblical evidence in favor of a literal creation week is the Sabbath of the 4th commandment.

&gt;Regarding Mike Enders: I do not know him personally. I do not know him well enough to even know if he is a true 'brother in Christ' or a wolf in sheep's clothing.

I think /u/Mike_Enders actually summed up the entire creationist industry pretty concisely:

&gt;You compromise the word of God to teach your own traditions.

But I don't think he's going to look inwards.",46,1541044989,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9t68mq/rcreation_sectarian_crisis_are_days_in_genesis_i/

There has to be a coordinated effort that focuses on the vilification coming from religious groups that claim to be scientific entity.

Doing nothing leads to this next becoming reality: 

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/first-thing-we-do-lets-kill-all-the-experts/

US academics seriously are being turned into the next targets while Trump/Pence go on like it's OK for them to be on the record for going along with a fraud that misrepresented what ""scientists"" have been all along saying. Here is an excellent (takes at least this long to cover) 17 minute correction of what vice president Pence (last I know) still represents:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikax0Y0NJsY

What is needed is organized and directed pressure for Trump/Pence into publicly retracting this conspiracy theory filled scientific disgrace that makes their message doubly dangerous to society. If they cannot then willingness to continue support hoaxes is an issue pertaining to religion compromised ability to be truthful. I would consider it a treatable mental health related issue where addiction to superiority feelings from religion creates rock-bottom bound monsters who are not afraid to deceptively take others down with them. That's when logic and reason fails, and need to treat this as religion justified criminal mindedness allowing continued vilification of ""scientists"" they are supposed to be fairly representing. Their fitness to lead will then be further in question.

Another decade of explaining the same things over and over again will only wear you out, even more. But forcing the Trump/Pence administration to get real in regards to regards to ""evolution"" and ""evolutionary theory"" would be a breakthrough. It's not asking them for anything hard, just have to get it right this time. Should be the easiest thing they had to do all month. It would much change at least my opinion of them. Getting otherwise kinda caught red handed willfully aiding a corrupt effort to make US scientists targets too would aid efforts to have both removed from office even though it has to be a one after another process, not at the same time. 

If this sounds worth a try to you then please suggest a way to get this on their agenda or whatever. My thoughts were to write a fancy letter with ribbon or seal to help make it look as important as it is, but those with Twitter accounts might more easily tweet a short agreed upon request we carefully write in this thread so that it clearly asks for the right thing.

{optional read below, obligatory ID related disclaimer where some likely already saw links and are used to the routine so can skip the rest} 

Forum regulars are most likely able to endure my dedication to getting the Theory of Intelligent Design with my name on it through this crisis. But they already know that it is based on (since 1979) beginner level self-learning machine intelligence robotics applied to modeling of intelligent and unintelligent cellular and coded molecular behaviors where which is can be easily seen by how many of the four basic features are required to model a given entity. If it has a memory that from hedonic/confidence level sensed mistakes learns successful actions that make it increasingly complex over time then all four are included. Water molecules have no such memory or hedonic/confidence system or takes guesses, atomic behavior makes all water molecules the same, unintelligent. It gives Mike Pence a way to honestly say at least the Theory of Intelligent Design worked out as planned. Only catch is that it's the kind of thing young high school level scientists most love, like digitally creating the closest thing to a living thing as computational methods allow, not misinformation used for bashing another theory, like Mike Pence is used to. 

Best place to learn details is now this forum, where what it contains for a wider message gets explained by what it makes possible for me to say to someone like Tim Stout in regards to their way of through science discovering how an/our intelligent creator works. I can be with him in regards to such a thing being possible, but being scientifically real requires being able to survive hard to please scientific audiences like in this forum. Most of the time they in my opinion do an excellent job answering questions best left to them to answer anyway. I'm best at cognitive science related issues that are invoked whenever ""intelligent"" behavior is mentioned or assumed. Path ultimately leads to educational material like at the worth respect Numenta open source forum, not institute that fights ""materialists"" instead of developing scientific ID related theory like they said they would:
 
https://discourse.numenta.org/t/oscillatory-thousand-brains-minds-eye-for-htm/3726                    

The most ID related part of my mission was there no issue either:

https://discourse.numenta.org/t/intelligence-and-transfer-learning/3894/7

Even though I am willing to for sake of science theory go this far with ID it's necessary for me to make it clear that I in no way endorse the actions of the DI, UD, Ken Ham and others. Being able to embrace the science world is replaced by the need to fight reason. Time to say enough is enough, and demand an end to that fraud and its bullying before the situation gets more out of control.

DebateEvolution,9qmnxt,timstout45,,t2_29ebkcx1,self.DebateEvolution,,A Natural Origin-of-Life: Every Hypothetical Step Appears Thwarted by Abiogenetic Randomization,"Over the years I have read many journal articles on abiogenesis.  Those in the field readily admit to its problems. For  instance Steve Benner said that over the past sixty years tens of thousands of articles \[in science journals\] in abiogenesis have been written, all claiming successful solution of some part of the problem, yet the problems remain \[doi: 10.1007/s11084-014-9379-0 \]. 

A few weeks ago I co-authored and posted to preprint an article at  r/https://osf.io/p5nw3  an article which hypothesizes a simple reason for the persistent lack of success in abiogenesis despite years of intense effort. In short, prebiotic processes consistently randomize their substrate. Life requires the exact opposite, the appearance of very high concentrations of specific chemicals spatially and temporally. As a result of this discrepancy, not a single experiment has yielded product which represents an advancement towards life and can then be used as produced in a subsequent step. Occasionally, useful products will be made. However, the prevalence of the randomly appearing ones overwhelms the usefulness of the desired ones and thwarts progress. 

For instance, one would never use the products of Millers experiment as substrate for an experiment on polymer production. Increased time does not improve the chance of success, it only leads to greater randomness. As an example, the Murchison meteorite plausibly has several million different isomers of C, N, O, H, P, and S. It has yielded a near-random sequence of the possibilities \[ do: i/10.1073/pnas.0912157107\]. It plausibly started with high concentrations of a few feed stock molecules not too awfully far removed from amino acids. Eventually, nearly complete randomization resulted. 

It is implausible that the process would ever reverse, where one would start with near-complete randomization and have random processes proceed to give a high concentration of amino acids.  Imagine a random walk in a large city with millions of intersections. Each intersection represents a potential isomer of the above six elements. Almost all of the intersections are characterized by several people located at them. Each person goes an an independent random walk. How realistic would it be to expect most of the millions of people distributed randomly among millions of intersections to all end up simultaneously at 28 specific intersections? These 28  intersections would represent the 20 canonical amino acids, four RNAs, and four DNAs used in life. 

To carry the illustration further, suppose that all of the millions of people started at one of four to six intersections located relatively close to the 28 desired ones. The desire is to have most of the people  end up simultaneously at the specified 28 locations. This represents a successful initial step of abiogenesis. After a very long period of time the distribution pattern is not the desired concentration at the 28 locations, but instead shows nearly complete randomization across millions of different locations. This would represent the Murchison meteorite. How plausible would it be to expect further random walks to eventually converge at the desired 28 locations? Because of the statistical law of large numbers, momentary fluctuations towards abnormally high distributions at any given  location will quickly be overwhelmed by a return to randomness. realitically, the desired focus representing life will never appear. 

I believe that qualitatively this represents the situation with Murchison. Even if the model were to be refined, perhaps by allowing jumps between intersections not just movement between adjacent intersections, or perhaps by allowing certain people at various differing intersections to join together in accordance with a set of specified rules and then allowing the combination to reach certain otherwise forbidden intersections, the refinement does nothing to overcome the effects of randomness. It only more accurately models the actual behavior of the organic substance of the meteorite. The important thing is that random changes lead away from what is needed, not towards it. There is no statistical basis to believe that a steady supply of the 28 canonical  molecules could be sustained for an extended period of time with such a model. Yet, abiogenesis would require this. 

I further believe that observed science has given all kinds of reasons to recognize that abiogenesis is impossible. The article posted at [osf.io](https://osf.io) mentioned above shows how randomness plausibly applies to the products  yielded by any and every proposed step of abiogenesis. One can apply the hypothesis presented in the article and qualitatively predict the results of any proposed prebiotic experiment. The process at work will randomize substrate and  naturally lead away from supply of the molecular products needed. This will apply to all steps; indeed, historically it has already done so for the reputedly thousands of already performed experiments.

Successful abiogenesis is going to need to show how random processes can overcome the effects of randomness. They can't. The fact that they can't is why no true progress has taken place in the field for the past 60 plus years. I suggest that the mentality that believes this is possible parallels the mentality of someone who thinks he has found a betting scheme to win at an unrigged, honest roulette wheel in a casino. The casinos love such people.

""If humans evolved from monkeys then how come there's still monkeys.""

""Well first off we didn't evolve from monkeys, we just have a common ancestor with them...""

So I've been reading about phylogenetics to better understand evolution recently. In doing so I came across the ideas of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly, [this diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png/640px-Monophyly%2C_paraphyly%2C_polyphyly.png) quickly shows what they mean. 

Now paraphyly includes the common ancestors of the groups that are paraphyletic. Everything I have found has shown me that Old and New world monkeys are both in the paraphyletic groupings of ""monkeys"" which includes their common ancestor with one another. However the common ancestor between these groups is also **our** common ancestor with these groups (as we are as closely related to New World monkeys as Old World monkeys are to them.) So surely this means we do have a monkey ancestor that we evolved from? Obviously it's important to make the distinction that we didn't evolve from any modern species of monkeys, but we surely did evolve from a primitive species of monkey.

This theory is based on 'observational science'.  Atomic theory is also used radiometric dating (Eg. U-Pb and K-ar). It stands to reason that if we have a good enough handle on atomic theory to inject a radioactive dye into a patient, we can use the same theory to date old stuff within a decent margin of error. (We can discuss this at more length, but it’s not really in the scope of the question)  This of course is based on the principle of [uniformitarianism]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism#Methodological_assumptions). If you don’t believe in uniformitarianism I would strongly suggest your time would be much better spent rallying against nuclear power plants than debating evolution on the internet as never know when the natural laws are going to change and a nuclear plant could meltdown or bomb spontaneously explode.

My instinct is that it would be trivially easy -- find low-probability agreements between clades in features that are demonstrably derived as opposed to inherited from their LCA. Barring LGT (itself a falsifiable hypothesis), there would be no way of explaining that under an evolutionary model, right?

DebateEvolution,9nrxwl,ArchMichaelWeb,,t2_140wrfw9,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"Omphalos/Five minutes hypothesis, Last Thursdayism － Irrational?!","Let's discuss what I consider to be the most sound creationist argument ever made. In fact, I would probably have accepted scientific picture in general and common descent in particular if not for this idea.

As you probably know, the hypothesis states that our universe appeared N time units ago in certain 'mature' state with further transition to its current condition by means of established natural laws we see today. Variations include YEC with its 6000 years, B. Russel's five minutes old universe, and a parody known as Last Thursdayism.

Now let' analyze this idea and define its properties.

As a hypothesis, Omphalos idea:

1. Is logically valid and self-consistent;
2. Does NOT contradict contemporary objective facts &amp; scientific findings. Moreover, it would tolerate ANY future data and evidence as well;
3. Does NOT violate fundamental scientific principles of naturalism (generalized form says nothing about supernatural forces like deities) and uniformitarianism (does not require non-stable natural laws or rates).

As a creationist argument, Omphalos idea:

1. Is NOT based on ignorance, misunderstanding or intentional misinterpretation of evolutionary biology by the likes of why-are-there-still-monkeys or what-are-odds-of-abiogenesis stuff;
2. Does NOT involve conspiracy theories;
3. Reconciles Biblical literalism with contemporary scientific evidence;
4. Is virtually irrefutable.

Objections to the hypothesis that I DO understand:

1. Being unfalsifiable, it is not scientific. Well, total agreement here: yep, it is not. But hey, it is not supposed to be and is not presented as such. It is a philosophical argument. Neitheir should it replace scientific theories nor represent some kind of alternative view in science classes. 

BTW, it seems that science guys may just reconsider falsifability requirement for scientific theories in future. 

Also, think of psychoanalysis. Looks pretty unfalsifiable as well, yet it works for millions of people!

2. It violates Occam's razor. Well, I would like to argue here. 

Omphalos hypothesis:

－ What constitutes contemporary or 6000 years old universe? 
－ Space, time, matter and energy. 
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Scientific worldview:

－ What constitutes pre-Big Bang singularity?
－ Space, time, matter and energy. 
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Same line of reasoning for evolutionary biology:

Omphalos hypothesis:

－ What constitutes Earth's biosphere?
－ A set of living creatures of numerous species.
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Scientific worldview:

－ What constitutes Earth's biosphere?
－ A set of living creatures of few species including Universal Common Ancestor.
－ How did it come into existence?
－ We don't know.

Why the hell does Omphalos explanation involve more entities or complexity?!

Objections to the hypothesis that I DO NOT understand:

1. That weird assumption of from-simplest-to-complex/from-chaos-to-order. What the heck? Why so? Why is it better/more rational/more practical than vice versa or from-complex-to-complex/from-one-order-to-another?

2. Counterarguments from ethics like those of deceiptful God/God's motives. These remind me of equally irrelevant creationist claims like 'if evolution is true, then morality is bullshit and life has no purpose or meaning'.

First of all, how can our limited intelligence comprehend God's motives much less judge Him?

Secondly, God didn't give revelations about common descent or Big Bang along with six-days Genesis story. These scientific theories came from humanity. They represent observer's inference so what the heck does it have to deal with God's honesty?!

Last but not least, God created mature Adam, right? Then it is fairly self-consistent to assume Him creating other things mature as well, including trees with rings, light from stars near to Earth already, and sufficiently diverse biosphere with highly developed species.

Almost all reactions/responses I've seen so far were either 'This idea is completely stupid/irrational', or 'Creationists using this argument are completely stupid/irrational', or both. At the same time one can calmly or even respectfully respond to rather silly and countlessly refuted creationist claims like 2nd law of thermodynamics, why are there still monkeys etc.

I am pretty much convinced of Omphalos hypothesis being perfectly reasonable and rational, logically valid and self-consistent. After seeing countless creationist claims with corresponding refutations from evolutionists, I came to the conclusion that Omphalos is the strongest and the most sound creationist argument.

It's been a while since I've visited here. Hope you're all doing well.

DebateEvolution,9l8hn7,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com on Genetic Entropy,"For the last few days this sub has been talking about a particular rebuttal to genetic entropy: The claim that if genetic entropy was real faster breeding organisms like viruses and bacteria should have significantly higher amounts of genetic entropy.

This is actually a specific argument I've made before. And at that time I received exactly one notable response (in a field of crickets). That response was a link to this CMI article, responding to that exact argument:

https://creation.com/genetic-entropy-and-simple-organisms

But first, I'd like to address another CMI article on genetic entropy:

https://creation.com/evidence-for-genetic-entropy

I've highlighted a few points, because they will become relevant later.

&gt;Second, despite pervasive and demonstrable natural selection among these viruses, the 1918 version of the human H1N1 virus went extinct, twice, at the appearance of a competing strain, apparently due to a lack of robustness caused by mutation accumulation. 

So the author is saying that the H1N1 virus went extinct due to genetic entropy, over a span of less than a century. This is important, because if genetic entropy can render a virus extinct in less than a century, what chance does a virus lineage have of surviving 6,000 years?

&gt; Lastly, since the various mutations accumulated in a linear fashion, **those mutations that escaped the selective filter (that would be most of the mutations)** apparently accumulated according to the laws of chemistry. 

So the author is saying that most of the mutations to this virus were not effected by selection. After all, that is the crux of the genetic entropy argument: that bad mutations accumulate and eventually damage the organism beyond the point of no return.

Now let's move on to the former article: Genetic Entropy and Simple Organisms.

'Genetic Entropy and Simple Organisms' was published in October 2012. 'Evidence for Genetic Entropy' was published in 2014. But, it is based on a paper published in October 2012. Also, and this part is very important, The 2012 paper, 2012 article, and 2014 article are all written by the *same person*, one Robert Carter.

Here's how Carter responds to the lack of genetic entropy in simple organisms:

&gt; For eukaryotic organisms (everything more complex than bacteria), the complexity of the genome makes the ‘mutation target’ quite large—in these more-complicated systems, there are more things that can go wrong, i.e. more machinery that can be broken.

[This is the citation given for that claim](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080596). Note that it doesn't actually say anything about harmful mutations being less common in bacteria.

That claim is really just a creationist assumption. Creationists assume that life is immaculately engineered, and that complexity can only be destroyed by mutations. Thus, the more complex something is, the more damage mutations will cause. But do we actually observe this in real life? I don't know, but I'm going to guess the answer is a resounding ""not really"".

&gt; On the other hand, changes to simpler genomes will often have more of a profound effect. Changing one letter out of the three billion letters in the human genome is not likely to create a radical difference. But the genome of the bacterium E. coli, for example, is about 1,000 times smaller than that of humans; bacteria are more specialized and perform fewer functions. Any letter change is more likely to do something that natural selection can ‘see’.

Hang on a second, wasn't this same person saying that most mutations went under the natural selection radar in viruses? Everything Carter says about bacteria is also true for viruses, many times more so. Viruses have even smaller genomes, and are even more specialized. Sounds like creationists want to have their cake and eat it.

&gt; First, bacteria do suffer from GE. In fact, and perhaps counter intuitively, this is what allows them to specialize quickly.3 Many have become resistant to antibiotics4 and at least one has managed to pick up the ability to digest non-natural, man-made nylon.5 This is only possible with much ‘genetic experimentation’, mostly through mutation, but sometimes through the wholesale swapping of working genes from one species to another. Many mutations plus many generations gives lots of time for lots of genetic experiments. In fact, we have many examples, including those just mentioned, where breaking a perfectly good working system allows a new trait to develop.6 Recently, it was discovered that oceanic bacteria tend to lose genes for vital functions as long as other species of bacteria are living in the area. Here we have an example of multiple species losing working genes but surviving because they are supported by the metabolic excretions of other species.7 Since the changes are one-way and downhill, this is another form of GE.

So they're saying that if a bacterium mutates to become better, that's genetic entropy. And if a bacterium mutates to become worse, that's also genetic entropy...Yep, they really do want to have their cake and eat it.

&gt; Another reason why bacteria still exist is that they have a lower overall mutation rate. The mutation rate in E. coli has been estimated to be about 1 in 10–10, or one mutation for every 10 billion letters copied.8 Compare this to the size of the E. coli genome (about 4.2 million letters) and you can see that mutation is rare per cell. Now compare this statistic to the estimated rate of mutation per newborn human baby (about 100 new mutations per child2) and one can begin to see the problem. Thus, there are nearly always non-mutated bacteria around, enabling the species to survive. However, there are also always mutated bacteria present, so the species are able to explore new ecological niches (although most known examples have arisen at the expense of long-term survival).

This may be true, but should a lower mutation rate really effect genetic entropy that much? Genetic entropy is supposed to be about mutations that go under the radar of selection. That should occur whether mutations are frequent or not. But regardless of the rates of mutation of specific bacteria, what about other organisms that don't have the same low mutation rate?

&gt; Bacteria can replace themselves after a population crash in a very short period of time. This is a key reason they do not suffer extinction. Thus, when exposed to antibiotics, for example, the few resistant cells within the population can grow into a large replacement population in short order, even though 99.99% of the original bacteria may have died.

This is of course true. But, wouldn't this also be true for all organisms, just much slower? If genetic entropy got so bad that humans started to die off, wouldn't the organisms without that fatal genetic entropy just repopulate the vacuum?

&gt; One might reply, “But mice have genomes about the size of the human genome and have much shorter generation times. Why do we not see evidence of GE in them?” Actually, we do. The common house mouse, Mus musculus, has much more genetic diversity than people do, including a huge range of chromosomal differences from one sub-population to the next. They are certainly experiencing GE.

Now this is actually a very important part of the argument. You might be able to come up with a bunch of excuses for why genetic entropy doesn't occur in bacteria or viruses, but what about something like mice? Surely every excuse you could make for bacteria wouldn't apply to mice. Their genome is roughly the same size as our's. They're the same class. So surely they would have hundreds of times more genetic entropy than us?

Well, Robert Carter says ""they are certainly experiencing GE""...without a citation, or even an example to back it up. I guess we're just supposed to take their word for it?

By the way, this is a common pattern you see in creationist articles, like those from CMI. They will often hand wave arguments with similar vague assurances that they're right. ""this rock/fossil/mutation is most certainly better explained by a global flood/not a transitional/a loss of information"". After all, you must remember that these people are paid to say that creationism's right, even if all they have to back that up is a baseless assertion that they're right.

And remember, the whole issue is that these organisms breed hundreds, thousands, even millions of times faster than us. I say this to pre-empt any creationist who thinks they might have proven their point by showing mice have 15% higher risk of genetic disease, or something along those lines. These organisms should have literally hundreds of times as much genetic entropy as us, not just tiny slithers more. And yet, that isn't what we observe.

So, the only logical conclusions are that genetic entropy either doesn't occur, or that there are natural mechanisms that prevent genetic entropy from accumulating past a certain point, or some combination of the two. Most likely the last one. ",122,1538625264,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9l8hn7/creationcom_on_genetic_entropy/

I’d just be interested to hear this sub’s view on the fact that these articles exist at all (assuming you accept my judgement on that point, which you are of course free not to, although you can't really address my question in the latter case).

&gt; My question is this: do you think it’s reasonable of me to assume that an organisation which produces nonsense in other fields, which I do understand, isn’t going to be accurate in matters of biology and geology, which I understand much less? Or would you expect anyone to keep an “open mind” with regard to the biological argument, no matter the known unreliability of these same organisations elsewhere?

To answer: They're bad in all subjects. Those organizations aren't there for original research or digging into the facts of the Bible or their religion. They're there to take what other people are working on, and seeing how they can fit that work to their conclusion.

Most of the time, they do this through similar dishonest tactics. Quote mining, misrepresentation, ignoring huge amounts of evidence contradicting their conclusion, etc.

Those who are more knowledgeable in a subject and are at least a bit intellectually honest can see how bad creationist sites like those misrepresent that subject to fit their mythical beliefs.",33,1538534735,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9kx9tk/a_nonbiologist_creationist_on_rcreation_discovers/

But I want to highlight something /u/guyinachair said here, because it's not just an important point; it's a *direct* refutation of ""genetic entropy"" as a thing that can happen. Here is the important line:

&gt;I think Sanford claims basically every mutation is slightly harmful so there's no escape.

&gt;Except you get **populations of fast reproducing organisms which have surely experienced every possible mutation, many times over and still show no signs of genetic entropy**.

Emphasis mine. 

To understand why this is so damning, let's briefly summarize the argument for genetic entropy: 

* Most mutations are harmful.

* There aren't enough beneficial mutations or strong enough selection to clear them.

* Therefore, harmful mutations accumulate, eventually causing extinction. 

This means that this process is inevitable. If you had every mutation possible, the bad would far outweigh the good, and the population would go extinct. 

But if you look at a population of, for example, RNA bacteriophages, you don't see any kind of terminal fitness decline. At all. As long as they have hosts, they just chug along. 

These viruses have tiny genomes (like, less than 10kb), and [super high mutation rates](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2323). It doesn't take a reasonably sized population all that much time to sample *every* possible mutation. (You can do the math if you want.) 

If Sanford is correct, those populations should go extinct. They have to. If on balance mutations *must* hurt fitness, than the presence of *every possible mutation* is the ballgame. 

But it isn't. It never is. Because Sanford is wrong, and viruses are a *direct* refutation of his claims. ",144,1538230158,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9jx1xp/direct_refutation_of_genetic_entropy_fastmutating/

You probably know the type of video. A fanatical christian and a student at a rally 'debating' something or another. I know I shouldn't waste my time with this, but I got curious.  
The script is familiar. The christian is trying to gotcha his opponent in a logical trap hoping this will convince anyone his answer must therefore be correct. In this case claiming you can't sense your senses or use logic to prove logic. Basically if your worldview is based on any assumption whatsoever, it must be wrong or 'you can't justify it'  
It is certainly true that it's a total assumption -as in an unprovable claim- that logic as we know it, is correct. What annoys me is that the rebuttal is that if only you start with God, the Supreme Law Giver blablabla... Right, only you need logic to even be able to distinguish between there being a God and there not being a God or there being one God or up to infinity Gods. This is conveniently ignored or he doesn't even realize his is subject to his own objection.  
I stopped watching when the fanatic starts talking about redemption because I can't stand that kind of proselytizing. My point is that without logic being true a priori, the statement ""God exists"" does not make any sense.",3,1538210667,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9jv1l8/rant_one_of_those_campus_debate_videos/

&gt;&gt;  So no one has done any calculations, including yourself. But you're apparently very certain that evolution would take ""obscenely long amounts of time,"" based on the calculations no one, including yourself, has ever done. Sorry, how exactly did you figure this all out? Also, billions and billions of years seems pretty like a pretty fucking huge amount of time to me, so I still don't understand what the problem is.

&gt; I haven't done precise calculations, but I have done some. You'd be surprised just how unlikely it is for a specific set of nucleotides to mutate in just the right way out of hundreds of not thousands of nucleotides within a genetic sequence. If we boil it down to extreme basics, assuming any non-drastic mutation chance (ie: somewhere between 30% and 70%), assuming that each mutation will always result in the desired nucleotide, and even assuming millions or billions of generations of organisms, the likelihood of even a relatively small change in genetic sequence is ridiculously low. If you would like to try it out for yourself, go ahead and assume a genetic sequence of 1500 base pairs, or 3000 nucleotides. Assume that 50 specific nucleotides must mutate and that the rest must remain the same. Pick whatever mutation chance you want and then try to calculate the likelihood of such a mutation taking place. Then after that multiply it by the number of generations and bam, you got your chance of mutation given said number of generations.

&gt; Like I said, incomplete. But I don't see how you can really reduce the ultimate result all that much.

________________

Mueller published his famous paper, Our Load of Mutations, in 1950. Since then there has been a growing realization that any type of population can potentially undergo mutational meltdown, given the right circumstances. Indeed, it is widely believed that the human race may presently be in error catastrophe. I have been studying this problem for roughly 18 years. The simple logic of genetic degeneration is summarized in the book Genetic Entropy (Sanford. J.C. 2014. Genetic Entropy. Fourth edition. FMS Publications. Waterloo, NY).

In 2005, my colleagues and I developed the numerical simulation Mendel’s Accountant, which simulates the mutation/selection process in a manner that can be comprehensive and biologically realistic. We have used this genetic tool to better understand how deleterious, near-neutral, and beneficial mutations accumulate over time, and how these mutations affect population fitness. When given any parameter settings that are even remotely reasonable, we consistently see that deleterious mutation count per individual increases linearly, while fitness decreases either linearly or as a smooth downward decay curve (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). The steadily increasing deleterious mutation count and the resulting fitness decline are primarily due to the fact that most non-neutral mutations have very slight fitness effects (i.e., they are near neutral), so they tend to be essentially invisible to natural selection. This problem grows much more acute when mutation rates approach one or more mutations per individual per generation. When this happens, such mutations accumulate faster than selection can possibly remove them, greatly accelerating genetic loss and resulting in error catastrophe. Our simulations show that it is surprisingly difficult to stop the continuous accumulation of deleterious mutations, and it is surprisingly difficult to amplify enough beneficial mutations so as to achieve any net gain in population fitness. Our studies indicate that these theoretical concerns are most acute in man, but are also very serious in other higher organisms that are diploid and have long generation times. These theoretical problems appear to even apply to certain bacteria and viruses.

We did simulations of bacteria and virus, to investigate if these organisms might possibly also be subject to net genetic loss by modeling E.coli-like bacterium and an influenza-like virus (Brewer, W.; Smith, F. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Information loss: potential for accelerating natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses ,In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (369-384)). In both cases we saw systematic net genetic loss. We then analyzed the real-world mutation accumulation pattern in the famous LTEE E. coli project, and the historical mutation accumulation in the H1N1 human strain of the influenza virus. Our results show that in the bacterial LTEE project, all of the documented “beneficial” mutations were reductive in nature, involving loss-of-function. This even applied to the citrate-uptake promoter mutation – which involved the loss of a regulatory function. This means that even while the E coli strains were adapting to the artificial in vitro conditions, the strains’ total functionality (as applicable to variable natural environments), was declining (i.e., reductive evolution) https://www.logosra.org/lenski. Likewise, we showed that the human H1N1 influenza strain had a perfectly linear rate of mutation accumulation over the last 100 years, such that 100f the genome was mutated. This linear accumulation was accompanied by a smooth and continuous decline in virulence, until the human H1N1 strain went “extinct” in 2009 (i.e., disappeared from the influenza database) (Carter R.C. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2012).  A new look at an old virus: patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling 9:42doi:10.1186/1742-4682-9-42).  

Do beneficial mutations out-weigh the effect of deleterious mutations? We have studied various systems to understand some of the limitations of beneficial mutations. It is well documented that beneficial mutations are very rare, and this should be obvious. However, beneficial mutations are problematic for many other reasons. First, we used simulations to show that the large majority of beneficial mutations should be nearly-neutral and so cannot be selectively amplified (Gibson, P.; Baumgardner, J.; Brewer, W. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Biological Information Be Sustained By Purifying Natural Selection? In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp232-263)). Second, our simulations confirm “Haldane’s Dilemma” and also “Haldane’s Ratchet” (simultaneous selection for even a modest number of beneficial mutations requires deep time, yet that amount of time causes a vastly larger number of nearly-neutral deleterious mutations to go to fixation). Lastly, our simulations show that when a beneficial function cannot be selectively favored until a string of two or more specific mutations arises, the waiting times can become extremely prohibitive (Sanford, J., Brewer, W., Smith F., and Baumgardner, J. 2015. The Waiting Time Problem in a Model Hominin Population. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling12:18).

It has been widely claimed that Fisher’s Theorem proves that as long as there is genetic variation in a population, fitness will always increase. We have shown mathematically that Fisher’s formulation was in error, and we have corrected his formulation. With this correction, the math indicates that net gain in fitness is very problematic – as is consistent with our numerical simulations (Basener, W., Sanford J. 2017. The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection with Mutations. Journal of Mathematical Biology. Volume 76, Issue 7, pp 1589–1622).

The Avida program is a simulation that shows net genetic gain. However, we have shown that Avida’s net gain requires that its beneficial mutations are assigned extremely unrealistic fitness effects (every beneficial mutation will double fitness). When realistic fitness effects are applied, there is always a fitness loss, converging to zero (Nelson, C.W. &amp; Sanford, J.C. (2011). The Effects of Low-Impact Mutations in Digital Organisms. Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, Vol. 8, (April 2011), p. 9., Nelson, C.; &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Computational evolution experiments reveal a net loss of genetic information despite selection, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (338-368)). Perhaps the most famous beneficial mutation is the NylB frameshift mutation. We have shown that this famous beneficial mutation actually never happened and that the NylB protein is not a novel protein, but is a widely distributed enzyme that has been present for a long time http://vixra.org/abs/1708.0370  

Two hypothetical solutions to the problem of continuous net degeneration have been proposed. These possible solutions are the synergistic epistasis mechanism and the mutation count mechanism. We tested both of these mechanisms using numerical simulations. Even using the most generous settings, the synergistic epistasis mechanism accelerated genetic decline and led to rapid extinction (Baumgardner J.; Brewer, W.; Sanford, J. (2013). Can Synergistic Epistasis Halt Mutation Accumulation? Results from Numerical Simulation, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (312-337)). Likewise, when we tested the mutation count mechanism, the fitness declined rapidly - except under highly artificial circumstances (i.e., where all mutations had an equal effect - which allowed mutations to stop accumulating) (Brewer, W.; Baumgardner, J. &amp; Sanford, J. (2013). Using Numerical Simulation to Test the “Mutation-Count” Hypothesis, In: Biological Information – New Perspectives (pp 298-311)).

The theoretical problem of continuous deleterious mutation accumulation has been acknowledged by most leading population geneticists ever since Muller published his paper in 1950. The greatest concern is the possible degeneration of the human population, which may result from both genetic and epigenetic mutations. I suggest that investigation into methods to reduce human mutation rates is highly warranted.

\[This paper is a pretty cool experiment\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632803](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632803)) I'm reading about in grad school that uses selective pressure in a really neat way. Basically, these scientists take RNA molecules that have a 90-nucleotide sequence generated at random. Then they put the RNA through a trial, which in this experiment is catalyzing a reaction that transfers a biotin to itself. The RNA molecules unable to catalyze the reaction are lost. But the RNAs capable of transferring the biotin survive and are replicated.

The RNAs that survived are then amplified, and run through another 10 rounds of selection then amplification. Sequences of the RNAs at the end of the experiment were 90% conserved, indicating that there was a single common ancestor. Oh, and during rounds 6 and 7, they used a PCR amplification that induced mutations in the RNA, with no ill effect on the kinetics of the RNA's catalytic ability. The rest of the paper demonstrates the kinetic properties of these RNAs. 

Idk, but I'm pretty sure this paper basically punches a hole in many Creationist arguments. Here's why: 

1) it demonstrates that RNA is capable of catalyzing reactions

2) it demonstrates that random sequences of RNA can generate reactions which can in turn be selected for

3) it shows that mutations can be beneficial

4) it demonstrates a plausible mode of evolution of random peptide formation. Once you get random peptides, you can do the exact type of selection this paper's experiment does, except with peptides instead of RNA. 

The major critique that I would anticipate from a creationist, if they actually knew anything about biochem, is that there are two steps in the experiment that require enzymes that already exist. One during the conversion of the selected for RNA to cDNA, and the other during PCR amplification. This paper is about the selection for a reaction analogous to amide bond formation. There are other papers, for example \[Highly Efficient Self-Replicating RNA Enzymes\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943892/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943892/)) that demonstrate RNA can replicate itself.

## [Different Approach to Problem of Orphan and TRG genes/proteins](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9i05ej/different_approach_to_problem_of_orphan_and_trg/)

📷 

\[**advanced topic in biophyiscs/molecular biology/structural biology**\]

An orphan gene is a gene found only in a species and an TRG (taxonomically restricted gene) is a gene found only in a group of species.  This is problematic for arguing universal common ancestry since it means some proteins have no traceable ancestor, possibly even in principle.  

A Darwinist will say, ""well it has an ancestor, we just don't know what it is.""  To which I'll say, ""if you don't know, why don't you just admit you don't know, and instead say, you only BELIEVE it has an ancestor in the absence of evidence. And furthermore, it shows how useless it is to BELIEVE it has a common ancestor as far REAL science is concerned where observable facts take priority over beliefs without evidence.""

Most of what I'm about to say floats over the head of most Evolutionary Biologists I've encountered.  Since I studied evolutionary biology at the graduate level, I know how to play their game, but more importantly I'm learning how to beat them at their own game. Evolutionary biologists don't usually have the background and logic skills to see problems in their own theories.

Don't be put off by the technical jargon you are about to see, just look at the following two pictures at the end of this OP.

Evolutionary biology is based a lot on cherry picking data and avoiding really hard questions.  

In the following two diagrams, you'll see little colored boxed which highlight major functional components of proteins. You'll see the protein Topoisomerase 2A has a totally different set of functional components than a family of proteins called KRAB ZNF proteins.

I posed this question over at [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate) evolution, and I got no answers:

&gt;""According to evolutionary theory, did all proteins descend from a single ancestral protein?""  
 

Well, it's understandable I got no responses since its obviously difficult to argue all proteins descended from a universal common ancestor protein, and assuming it did, the assumption is utterly useless since all one really needs to do REAL biology (vs. speculating on useless evolutionary stories) is to note ""similar things behave in similar ways, and those that aren't similar don't""  Like, DUH!  You don't need the assumption of Universal Common Ancestry (UCA) to see that, just an assumption of common pattern, common architecture, dare I say,  common DESIGN!

Anyway, let the reader see whether insistence on Universal Common Ancestry will help you understand protein architecture:

DebateEvolution,9h8fm5,Diligent_Nose,Geologist,t2_4c608,self.DebateEvolution,,"Darwinist Hypocrisy About The Quality and Value of Their Beliefs to Society, a very brief review.","Once again, /u/stcordova has felt the need to retreat to a safe space.

Here’s a quick and dirty 10 min review of his stuff.


&gt;So I asked some Darwinists what would count as evidence of a Creator God. One said, ""nothing"" at the DiscussEvolution Discord server. That was an honest answer. Kudos for honesty.
&gt;Some other Darwinists punted and didn't give an answer, another said, ""I don't know in advance what would count as evidence, it's impossible to know what would be positive evidence for creation."" So that's an admission he doesn't know even in principle what would be evidence of creation! He admitted he accepted evolution based on FAITH, not formal proof.
&gt;Regarding creation and ID, at least I said, I don't think there is DIRECT evidence, maybe formal proof is impossible.

I’ve love to hear what the indirect evidence for a creation model is, I’ve never heard of one that rivals the completeness of evolution.  Most of the time people say they’re supporting creationism when they only are only attacking evolution.  Show up with a concrete model and I guarantee people will pay attention. 

&gt;Many of the Darwinists will say, ""creationists don't believe in evolution because they are scientifically illiterate, they believe in some imaginary being. They have no DIRECT evidence. Time to grow up.""

Snark aside, you have no DIRECT evidence for a deity.

&gt;But let's turn the tables. They don't have direct evidence either!! In physics, for example, we can repeat the measurement of gravitational acceleration near the Earth's surface. That is a repeatable experiment.
&gt;In contrast evolutionists can't give direct evidence that a giraffe and a tree descended from some ancestor, let us call it ""great great....grandma."" So what did ""great great...grandma"" physically look like, and why is it reasonable that a tree and giraffe could descend from ""great great...grandma."" A giraffe has a heart, it has legs, it can walk, see, hear, taste and smell. A tree? Well it can't do that because it's a tree.

You’re right, to the best of my knowledge evolutionary biologists can’t.  How does that invalidate evolution? Theories aren’t complete, or perfect, they only describe what we can observe to the best of our ability. Assuming you could come up with a smoking gun to disprove evolution, that by no means validates creationism.

&gt;So I point out to them, they don't know how evolution actually worked, they only guess. 

No, people not true. Look no further than labs that study antibiotics and drug resistance, and GMO crops to explore two fields that depend on evolutionary theory. Are you arguing they’re just throwing shit in a petri dish and getting lucky?

&gt;They can't demonstrate from actual principles of physics and chemistry nor from experiment that a giraffe and a tree could in fact descend from a common ancestor. They can't demonstrate from physics and chemistry that natural selection will work as claimed. 

See above.

&gt;I point out to them the net average result of natural selection is LOSS or DESTRUCTION of function, not construction of function. So if the net direction of evolution is toward simplicity (reductive evolution), then how did complexity evolve. The only place the net direction of natural selection is toward more complexity is in the imagination of evolutionists, not in DIRECT lab and field observations.

Oh great, ‘genetic entropy’ again, not my area, but others here who have studied that material have discussed why it’s bunk at length.

&gt;They are left in the unfortunate position of describing changes that in sum total look miraculous. Ah they irony, a theory that claims to be natural needs the equivalent of supernatural miracles to rescue it. 

I do believe you’re getting the sides confused. I don’t see anything in the theory of evolution that requires the supernatural. 

&gt;So their evidence is lousy, so bad that even a renowned evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne said, 
&gt;&gt;In science's pecking order, evolutionary biology lurks somewhere near the bottom, far closer to [the pseudo science of] phrenology than to physics.

If you’d read the next paragraphs you’d see he was referring to evolutionary phycology as behavior, unlike bones do not fossilize. Bring him in to explain to you why evolution is as robust as theories come, I’m sure he’ll be very pleased you’re quote mining him. 

&gt;At least three regular participants here a r/creation have physics degrees (myself included). 

Great, so people that hold degrees here are fine, but people across the row that hold degrees don’t know what their talking about.  Got it.

&gt;Relative to the major theories of physics, evolutionary biology has no direct e
experiments, only silly claims based on what they advertise as relevant experiments. 

[Demonstrably false.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9gnlpi/why_is_there_still_a_debate_when_evolution_is/e66utye/)

&gt;They point to antibiotic resistance and Galopagos finch birds, etc. Well, the problem is these experiments could just as well be interpreted to show there are limits to evolution. 

Moving the goal posts? When does evolution become not ok?  Be specific, don’t bring up ‘kinds’ without a very specific definition.

&gt;No matter how much selection pressure and mutation is applied, a bacteria remains a bacteria, it would appear it would take a miracle for the bacteria to become a Eukaryote like a human. Apply enough selection pressure on a population of birds, and it won't turn into some other creature, most likely the selection pressure will kill it. In fact species of birds are going extinct at an alarming rate. Selection is a powerful destroyer of species, it is not a good originator!

We have very good evidence for Dinos &gt; birds, land mammals to whales, and we know Skate genes work in Mice embryos, this is just off the top of my head, I’m sure there are many others.

&gt;One can't, to paraphrase physicist Fred Hoyle, evolve a potato into a rabbit.

Literally no one is arguing that we can.
&gt;Further, the claim of universal common ancestry is worthless to operational science. Evolutionists will say, ""well we're able to use lab rats to study humans because of the belief of common descent."" 

I don’t know about you, but I really, really like GMOs and pharmaceuticals. 

&gt;Unfortunately for them, creationists were the pioneers of comparative anatomy. Creationist Richard Owen (who was critical of Darwin), was the one who coined the word ""homology"" that was based on the observed common design in creatures. 

According to Owen’s [Wikipedia page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen#cite_note-Amundson2007-5) he was a critic of Darwin

&gt;“Owen agreed with Darwin that evolution occurred, but thought it was more complex than outlined in Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[4] Owen's approach to evolution can be seen as having anticipated the issues that have gained greater attention with the recent emergence of evolutionary developmental biology.[5]“

Stop spreading lies. 
&gt;Owen like others claimed something that is designed one way is unlikely to evolve to another design. That's why something designed to be a fish won't ever give rise to a bird, it will on give rise to other fish!

Something we agree on, notice how humans, whales, bats, and platypus are all mammals?  My daughter is also a mammal.

&gt;Also, it was creationist Edward Blyth who actually put forward the ideas of indefinite radiation and natural selection (ideas which Darwin plagiarized, distorted and gave no appropriate credit to Blyth). 
[See this book by the Provost of an Ivy League School: https://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Mysterious-Mr-Evolutionists-Harvest/dp/0156239493]

I haven’t read this book, and don’t have time to look for a review currently, but I suspect if it held much water, the authors argument wouldn’t be tucked away in a 37 year old book I can buy for the price of a cup of coffee. 
 
&gt;So the quality of Darwinist beliefs in Universal Common Ancestry lacks direct evidence, and its value to science is next to nothing. Yet they insist one is illiterate if one doesn't agree with their professions of faith. And Darwinism is FAITH, it is not, compared to theories in physics and chemistry, real science.

Again, no, there is lots of evidence, and as per usual, you’ve only attacked, poorly I may add the theory of evolution without providing any evidence for a theory that better explains our observations.

I urge you to read [this paper]( http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/5330/cleland01-historical_science.pdf) on the validity of historical science.

I recently stumbled on a thread in /r/Creation that was overlooked.

Titled: [**I have a friend who claims that “there are no credible scientists who don’t agree with evolution”**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9b60ry/i_have_a_friend_who_claims_that_there_are_no/e51yr0f/?context=1).

I recommend reading the whole thread and especially the top comment to understand how the discussion started. The discussion channels into the usual topic. Mainly what causes so many scientists to not be creationists? The topic then further channels into the question of peer-review and peer-pressure.

So far so good? Then let us observe the discussion. Since I have linked to it, you guys can read the full discussion and I will highlight some of the more interesting points.


___

/u/lisper:

&gt;&gt;Any scientist must agree with the majority of scientists or his work will not pass peer review.

&gt;No, that's not true. What is true is that if you disagree with established theories you need some damned good evidence and arguments to back up your claims. Also, you need to at the very least understand the established theories. One of the problems with Creationists is that they spend a lot of effort attacking straw men (""You grandpappy was a monkey"") so they have kind of worn out their welcome as scientific dissenters.

/u/Mike_Enders:

&gt;The ""your granddaddy was a monkey"" stereotype is just more unfounded bias. We are talking here about peer reviewed publication. There is zero evidence any creationist scientist ever offered any such kind of paper.


/u/lisper:

&gt;No, it's an argument that I have seen creationists advance in the past.

&gt;In fact, here is a page from the Institute for Creation Research:

&gt;http://www.icr.org/article/charles-darwin-man-behind-monkey

&gt;The headline is ""Charles Darwin: The Man Behind the Monkey.""


/u/Mike_Enders:

Again those are just media sites. You continue to misrepresent.

&gt;Like I said your same argument can be made on the other side.

&gt;And yet I do not try to paint those who submit to peer reviewed science as responsible for Dawkin's rhetoric in his books. I can make the same bogus argument you are making.

&gt;So to be valid you need to stop with that fallacious conflation. Of course several creationist sites talk about God and scripture just as several atheists sites talk about evolution and atheism.


/u/lisper then asks a **simple question**:
 
&gt;**Who would you hold forth as the best representatives of the creationist position?** Because AFAICT, ICR and AIG seem to be the intellectual leaders, and they both appeal heavily to religion.


/u/Mike_Enders

&gt;Why do we need to appeal to anyone? You just claimed facts are what matters. Consensus arguments are not good proxies. They are just lazy skip the data arguments.

&gt; Your argument makes little sense.

/u/lisper:
 

&gt;&gt;Why do we need to appeal to anyone?

&gt;I didn't say we did. I just said that ICR and AIG do.

&gt;&gt;Your argument makes little sense.

&gt;What argument? I was not advancing an argument, I was asking a question: **who would you cite as the best representatives of the creationist position?**

___

In my opinion, the following comment from /u/Mike_Enders then quickly lets the entire discussion fall apart:

___


/u/Mike_Enders:

&gt;I have little taste for rank dishonesty.

/u/lisper:

&gt;&gt;I have little taste for rank dishonesty.

&gt;Well, that's one thing we can agree on.


I the following comments, /u/Mike_Enders vocabulary features a lot of the following snippets:


&gt; what are you like 9 years old?

&gt; So much for your honesty.

&gt; typical atheists

&gt; Lol.....such a liar

&gt; No time for games kid - I'm grown. Bye

&gt; ROFL..still such a liar

&gt; Never agreed with you either liar

&gt; I have no need to answer your question

&gt; Sorry kid. 

&gt; I stopped taking anything you say or ask seriously


However, redditor /u/lisper rakes up whatever effort he has left and tries to bundle up his arguments again:

/u/lisper 

&gt; &gt; You ARE begging for me to accept your premise

&gt; Nope.  Just asking respectfully for an answer to a simple question: what would you point to as a good source for creationist arguments?

&gt; The way real science is done is that someone advances a hypothesis, checks to see that it is consistent with the available data, and then makes a testable prediction against which an experiment can be performed.  So I invite you to consider the following hypothesis: what if the creationist position really is bankrupt?  What if the answer to my question is that there is no answer?  What testable predictions wold this theory make?  How would we expect a creationist to react when asked to point to a source of material on creationism that does not invoke the authority of scripture?

&gt; Well, one thing that we might expect is for them to get defensive, to start levying false charges against the person asking the question, and basically to do anything they can to obfuscate the fact that they are avoiding answering the question because in fact it has no answer.

&gt; Just something to think about.
    

/u/Mike_Enders

&gt;**I have no idea what you said in that wall of text because I was too bored by your lying to give you the respect of reading it. Just stopped right there.**


&gt;However you have proven once again the tendency for atheists to have very low morality so thanks for that at least.

___


Hmm okay. The impression is left to the reader with no commentary coming from me. I have two comments to insert at this point:

1. Why is it difficult to name a creationists organization that is representative to the creationist movement? Is this a threatening question somehow? To me at least, almost every creationist shows a preference to a certain website. So why is it so difficult to name one?

2. I am particularly interested about one specific part that /u/Mike_Enders mentioned:

&gt;Dawkins is a great popularizer of atheism and evolution. In his books which millions of his fans approve of he makes many strawman arguments....MANY.

A) Which books is he talking about specifically, excluding God Delusion?

B) What exactly would be examples of strawmen that he uses?


___

I am hoping for a civil and calm discussion, whoever chooses to participate or just spectate.

Thank you and have a nice evening! Be civil!

DebateEvolution,9gmasp,Diligent_Nose,Geologist,t2_4c608,self.DebateEvolution,,Learning the lessons of Mount St Helens Reviewed,"/u/Kanbie85 recently challenged me to ‘Get yourself out of this echo chamber and check out some educated creationists like those over at icr.org or creation.com. This followed a discussion where I regrettably did not put as much effort into the discussion as I should have.


I asked Kanbie85 to suggest an article, first he suggested genetic entropy, but as I’m not a geneticist (and that has been discussed at length very recently) I asked for a geology based paper. He suggested [Learning the lessons of Mount St Helens](https://creation.com/lessons-from-mount-st-helens).  Here is a line by line break down of the article:

 

&gt;It was not until I visited Mount St Helens volcano in Washington State, USA, that I fully appreciated the immensity of its 1980 explosion. Over many years, I had learned a lot about the eruption, watching videos, listening to lectures, and reading reports. When the mountain blew up physically, it also blew away many false ideas about geology, ideas that were wrong, but had been believed for more than a century.

I’ve started boiling my potatoes before roasting them, the outside is crispier than before, and I have been getting rave reviews on my method of baking potatoes. I must have been wrong about everything I knew about cooking before.  Science becomes stronger as it tests hypothesis with new information, this is a feature, not a bug.

&gt;After decades of inactivity, Mount St Helens coughed to life in March 1980, some two months before its explosive eruption. Its smoke and rumbling were warning that something big was building up. Officials set up an exclusion zone around the volcano based on scientists’ ideas about how an eruption would occur. However, the blast was larger than expected, plus it first erupted sideways to the north instead of vertically. Of the 57 people that died, all but three were outside the exclusion zone.Wrong geological ideas can be deadly.

I’m sure those geologists who set up the exclusion zone feel horrible that people died. Before throwing rocks at ‘wrong geology’ let’s dive into the meat of the article.

&gt;Wrong geological ideas have also led people to wrong ideas about the Bible—that the events it describes were mythological and did not actually happen. Mount St Helens changed that, which is why I have been so interested in what happened. The eruption demonstrated that geologic catastrophe can produce in hours and days geologic features previously believed to have taken millions of years. When we see what the volcano did in such a short time, we can better appreciate how the catastrophe of Noah’s Flood formed the much larger geological features on planet Earth.

I’m not convinced that studying volcanism is analogous to understanding flooding, I assume the article will enlighten us.

&gt;For many years, geologist Dr Steven Austin researched the geological effects of the Mount St Helens eruption and its aftermath. He published extensively on how that catastrophe sheds light on the global catastrophe of Noah’s Flood, which is a key to confirming the Bible’s truth.1

Great, Steve Austin is a [legit geologist]( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/credentials.html), hopefully we can get to some actual data soon.

&gt;One of the many surprising results was an 8 m (25 ft) thick sedimentary deposit exposed in a cliff alongside the North Fork Toutle River (figure 4). It is composed of finely-layered sediment (figure 5). From eyewitness reports, photographs, and monitoring equipment, it is known that this whole deposit formed in just three hours, from 9 pm to midnight on 12 June 1980.1 It was deposited from black clouds of fine, hot ash mixed with gas, blasting at high speed from the volcano—a pyroclastic flow. Ash-laden and heavier than air, the flow surged down the side of the volcano and along the river valley at more than 160 km/hr (100 mph), hugging the ground and depositing ash.

First, we have a ‘sedimentary deposit’ of pyroclastic flow. [Pyroclastic flows are volcaniclastic]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_rock), not sedimentary. I’m not sure why this article failed to get basic terminology right.


The only reason geologists would be surprised that a 25m thick could be deposited rapidly is if they hadn’t been keeping up with the research [this]( http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(78)90003-3) 1978 paper (I’m going to only use papers from before 1980) discusses a 3-4 metre thick deposit that formed in 90 minutes during the eruption of the Ngauruhoe volcano in 1975.  There are many more examples of pyroclastic flows in the literature, but I wanted to use an article that had the time deposition took to be included to drive my point home. Steve Austin seemingly failed at reading the literature before heading to this study area, good use of limited field time there Austin^/s

&gt;The big surprise was that the sediment deposited in fine layers called laminae. You would expect a catastrophic, high speed ash flow to churn the fine particles and form a uniform, well-mixed deposit. Thus, it had been conventionally thought that fine layers had to accumulate very slowly one upon the other over hundreds of years. But Mount St Helens showed that the coarse and fine material automatically separated into thin, distinct bands, demonstrating that such deposits can form very quickly from fast flowing fluids (liquids and gases). Since then, laboratory experiments have shown that fine laminae also form quickly from flowing water.2 This shows how finely-layered sandstone deposits in other situations, such as some of the lower layers in the Grand Canyon,1 likely formed rapidly, which could have happened within the time-scale of Noah’s Flood.

Again, [this]( http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(79)90008-8) 1979 paper discusses laminae in pyroclastic surge flows. Geologist knew laminae could form during pyroclastic surges.

The basal formation of the [Grand Canyon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Grand_Canyon_area#Vishnu_Basement_Rocks) is composed of metamorphic rocks, not volcaniclastic rocks, so no, we cannot draw a comparison.

&gt;The Mount St Helens eruption also demonstrated how canyons can be formed much faster and in a different manner than conventionally thought. Ongoing eruptions eroded the thick sediment dumped at the base of the volcano, producing multiple channels and canyons. One such channel was dubbed ‘Little Grand Canyon’ (figure 6), being about 1/40th the size of Grand Canyon.1 Its side walls were up to 40 m (140 ft) high, its width up to 45 m (150 ft), and a small stream of water ran through it. Someone coming across that canyon could easily conclude that it was eroded slowly and gradually by the small creek now running through it, over many hundreds or thousands of years.


Where is the ‘little grand canyon’ on the [map]( https://dl0.creation.com/articles/p119/c11976/Mt-St-Helens-map-lge.jpg) of the study area? The fact that the eruption eroded material that was deposited earlier in the eruption is not the same as quickly removing lithified rock.  I can mix up cement, and quickly dig it up before it lithifies, once it sets though, it’s a lot harder.

&gt; However, the formation of this canyon was documented. It was carved by a mudflow caused after a small eruption of Mount St Helens melted snow within the crater on 19 March 1982. The mud built up behind debris, burst through it, and cut the canyon in a single day. So, the creek did not cause the canyon. The canyon caused the creek.

See above.

&gt; Two other canyons on the flanks of the volcano provide more dramatic evidence of how canyons can be eroded quickly. Loowit Canyon, which is over 30 m (100 ft) deep, was gouged in part through old, hard volcanic rock called andesite (figure 7). Again, it could be supposed that the streams entering the canyon by a waterfall eroded it over thousands of years. However, mudflows eroded the canyon in a few months in the second half of 1980. It is still being eroded, but nowhere near as quickly as it was during the major eruptions of the volcano. Step Canyon, to the west of Loowit Canyon, is even larger, over 600 ft deep. Mudflows draining the volcano’s crater also eroded this canyon in the same time period. Once again, the force of the mud cut through solid rock, including old, andesite lava flows.

According to the [USGS P28]( http://homepages.uc.edu/~maynarjb/MtStHelens/Gliken_1996_debris%20avalanche.pdf) the old andesite was a rubble unit from previous eruptions.  Again, I can move unlithifed material with a spade. A volcano is more powerful than I am.

&gt; The volcanic eruption, including the landslide, pushed rock down the mountainside and across the landscape. As the large rocks slid, they gouged grooves and scratches in the underlying rock (figure 8). It has been customary for geologists to interpret grooves on rocks as being formed by a glacier, as the ice and rocks creep across the landscape. However, this interpretation would be wrong for the grooves in rocks at Mount St Helens; they were gouged by fast-moving rocks propelled by geological catastrophe, not a slow-moving glacier. This means that many geological areas previously interpreted as glacial environments need to be re-assessed, because they may not be glacial at all.3

I agree, we should re-assess striations in rocks, when evidence of volcanism is nearby. I can drive a few hours and see plenty of evidence of glaciation, yet I’m a few days drive from the nearest volcano. With the last ice age being 10ka, I’d be very shocked if we’d missed the signs of a volcano that erupted that recently. I know a lot of farmers and non of them have found a volcanic rock in their fields. 

&gt; The magnificent pine forest surrounding Mount St Helens prior to the eruption supported a regional timber industry employing many people. The blast on 18 May, together with the landslide and subsequent mudflows, transformed the northern forested area into a vast, gray landscape (figure 3). In some places trees were destroyed up to 25 km (15 miles) from the volcano. They were stripped of branches and leaves, uprooted or snapped off, and knocked to the ground facing the direction of the blast.

Sure, it would suck to live near a volcano that erupts.

&gt;A small portion of the landslide on 18 May plunged into picturesque Spirit Lake, just north of the volcano. This hurtled an enormous wave across the lake and 260 m (860 feet) up the hillside opposite. As it rushed up the slope, the wave ripped out a million large pine trees and dragged them back into the lake. Initially, the surface was so tightly packed with floating logs that the water could not be seen. Log mats like this would have been common during Noah’s Flood as the forests growing in the pre-Flood world were ripped up by the destructive floodwaters.

First that's not evidence for a flood, secondly it put limitations on the depositional environment of the flood due to the high energy setting the article claims occurred with the flood.

&gt; The logs floating on Spirit Lake rubbed together and scraped off bark and remaining branches. This sank to the bottom of the lake forming an organic layer of peat, suggesting a mechanism for how coal deposits could have formed during Noah’s Flood.

Without showing the chemistry of a peat bog turning into coal in 6000 year or whatever the time frame is, this quote is meaningless. [Here]( https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coal/) is a very basic overview on the formation of coal deposits. [Here](http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.43.3.207) is a more in depth look, although I’m sure that paper is fairly out of date. Until a model the rapid change from peat to coal is introduced, we can the last sentence.

&gt;Surprisingly, as the logs became water-logged they tipped on their ends and floated vertically (figure 9). Eventually they sank to the bottom with their heavy root-end penetrating the sediment and peat layers there. The initial sediment deposited in the lake raised its floor by some 90 m (300 ft), and further sediments were deposited in the subsequent months and years. As more logs sank they formed a ‘forest’ of vertical logs with their roots buried in sediment at different levels on the bottom (figure 10). If someone saw this but did not know how it formed, then they might think multiple forests had grown in place and been successively buried. But such an interpretation would be wrong. The vertical ‘trees’ at the bottom of Spirit Lake were ripped up from one forest that was destroyed in one catastrophic event.

Ah, polystrate fossils, lets go back to [1868]( http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/polystrate/trees.html) to show how this can occur.

&gt; Trees were also engulfed by the landslide and carried kilometres down North Fork Toutle River. More than 30 years after the disaster, along the Hummocks Trail I saw many tree trunks still protruding from the ground. In the past, geologists routinely said vertical tree trunks entombed in sediment were buried where they were growing.4 That is what the interpretive signs at Specimen Ridge in Yellowstone Park used to say about the multiple layers of vertical tree trunks exposed there—that the forests grew and were buried multiple times over many tens of thousands of years. This time-frame clearly contradicted the biblical one. However, Mount St Helens has changed that thinking and the signs have been removed from Yellowstone. Geologists now know that trees can be transported into place by volcanic catastrophes and left sitting vertically, as we saw at Mount St Helens.

See above.

&gt; The devastating eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 showed a lot about the effects of geological catastrophe. Features that geologists have traditionally thought needed long periods of time to form formed very quickly, within hours, days and weeks.

Nope, we’ve shown that’s false, geologists have long known thick beds can from rapidly.

&gt; Yet, by volcanic standards, even in historic times, the Mount St Helens blast was relatively small, ejecting some 1 km3 (0.2 cubic miles) of ash. The eruption of Vesuvius in ad 79 was three times larger, Krakatoa in 1883 was 18 times bigger, and Tambora in 1815 was 80 times larger. The volume of lava in the Deccan Traps in India is some 5 million times more. These indicate that volcanic eruptions during Noah’s Flood were millions of times larger. When we consider the true immensity of the biblical cataclysm, and how it impacted the whole earth, Mount St Helens helps us envisage how Noah’s Flood explains the geology of the world, and how it happened so quickly.

And when Jellystone goes off, it’s gonna make all those look like childs play. Of course when we examine a larger time frame there will be larger volcanic events, stating that fact does not provide evidence for global flooding.

&gt; Once we realize that the Bible is not mythological but records true events in history, we can approach its message with a new mindset. Then we are open to make new discoveries about our world and our place in it.


This article has done nothing to support that claim. Furthermore this sentence along with the creation.com mission statement: To support the effective proclamation of the Gospel by providing credible answers that affirm the reliability of the Bible, in particular its Genesis history, shows, that only evidence that supports the Bible is admissible

Ok, there we have it. Assuming that’s the top quality work of creation.com I won’t be repeating this exercise, and I assume it is at least average quality if not higher as it was recommended to me.  I’ll leave the K-Ar dating for another day (maybe), let me know if I missed anything, Kanbie85, I know you’ll be the first to let me know if I got something wrong, I look forward to hearing about it. I did get a bit lazy at the end, but when damn near every paragraph had major problems with it, going over this article became depressing, I had hoped debunking a cherry picked article would have at least been a bit challenging.

&amp;nbsp;

Almost all the atheists I have encountered online survive by a number of fallacious memes and outright contradictions which are easy to deconstruct (but they will have none of it because they are not particularly honest).

""God of the gaps""

This one I see even theists and apologists buying but if falls apart by another proposition ( which is actually  true) that atheists often make - ""Science is provisional"". They usually state this when something is shown to be false  that they previously adhered to.  The whole sentence goes something like this -

""Science is provisional.  We go with the best explanations we have at the time. Self correction by evidence is what makes science what it is"".

The contradiction with the God of the gaps counter is easy to see when we think about  it.  In Science we go with the best explanation we have based on the state of evidence  at the time.  We don't invoke imaginary evidence of what will be found at a later date.  Though there are fallacious - we don't understand it so God exist arguments - its nevertheless part of science to go with the explanation that best suits the present facts.   Atheists turn this on its head dishonestly when the facts  line up with a best explanation being a logical force in nature - then they argue  science  explanations should not be based on the  evidence we have at this time.  Science magically then is no longer provisional  and we should await an imaginary discovery of evidence that will change the best explanation we have now .

""Atheism is just a lack of belief"" or ""I just don't believe""

This one is just dishonest and/or ignorant to its core.   No system of belief  is ""just""  a single proposition.  I don't believe the earth is flat for   a number of reasons not ""just a lack of belief in the earth being flat"".   Every atheist I have read and debated over two decades has a positive belief in naturalism. If you disbelieve in something widely held  (or even not widely held) its because you have  a positive belief in something else  - whether that's  in your education, your personal anecdotal experience or because it contradicts some other previously held position - you don't ""just"" disbelieve.

""Argument from incredulity""

This is a master of of a psychological ploy crafted to rebut basic mathematical probabilities. If something is improbable and you point it out  the rebuttal is that the improbability does not need to be answered  because citing the improbabilities is an argument from incredulity.  The contradiction that is apparent is that the standard is completely flipped when atheists use their ""incredulity"" that a loving God would do this or allow that. Its also flipped by atheists when as they say ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"".  In that case quite often extraordinary is really just their ""incredulity"".  They can't imagine a God or that naturalism isn't the ultimate explanation for reality..

Thats just a few fallacies and contradictions atheist use online and of course the ""God did it"" meme which is just a lie since almost all sciences were established by theists who never stated ""God did it"" .  Besides which everything else but ""God did it"" is acceptable as they readily show when thought experiments (else where known as pure imagination) are advanced as scientific answers to improbabilities.

I no longer take online atheists seriously (particularly those with obvious psychological issue hanging out in theist sections - How long would you hang out in an online community with people who believed in Santa and elves? Yet thats pretty much what the CLAIM to see in theists).  Offline I've met a few thoughtful atheists. Not one online.  


&gt; Now, to be fair, my characterization of what he said is paraphrased.  If  you want to ask him yourself what he actually said and believes, I  should give him the opportunity to speak for himself. So you can talk to  him here.  If you do, you have to do it in the ""thunderdome"" section,  otherwise he threatens to ban you if you discuss it in the ""general""  section. 

Sounds as productive as  watching paint dry.


&amp;nbsp;

A couple comments for the kind of responses you will get to your OP  from atheist with special thanks to [u/Dataforge](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dataforge)

&gt;In that thread Sal, and a couple of other creationists, try to defend  the use of god of the gaps argument, saying they're not actually  fallacious. Which is of course absurdly wrong.

this is another classic Atheist tactic.  Change what was said and attack the strawman then do a victory dance (preferably where a lot of other atheists hang out so there is insulation).   NO one ever stated all god of the gaps arguments are wrong. In fact I took pains to say exactly the opposite. There are some valid uses of it.  whats absurd is creating a strawman and then proclaiming the actual statement absurd but then that's the nature of strawman arguments isn't it? The point is  Atheist overuse and misuse the god of the gaps argument. They invoke it with no thought and they violate the fundamentals of the fallacy as long as  the word ""God"" is extracted whihc we all know is TOTALLY fallacious.

&gt;First of all, let's define exactly what a god of the gaps argument is.  As the name suggests, it's finding a gap in knowledge, and saying that  having that gap in knowledge means that a god must have been the cause.

and therein lies the issue.  any time you use a vague standard for one side and not another  it is by definition **Fallacious**. Saying we do not know  and because we don't know something - God exists **IS a valid accusation** of the God of the gaps argument. However in what area of science do we not have gaps of knowledge? none. Thats the whole idea of  science being provisional. So atheists often invoke God of the gaps when THEY cannot explain the logical implications of what we DO KNOW. as their get out of Jail free card.

Looking like no way out of the logic of theists? Stuff your defeat into  the fact that every area has things we do not know, claim your answer to theists is in that gap, but not discovered yet  and then invoke the God of the gap  defense. Voila!  you have avoided defeat for any and everything.

No apologies. G of G is a farce when so used. Because science is provisional we  make decisions based on  data that is there against  evidence that isn't there.  We do that in all areas of seeking facts and evidence. Atheists turn that on its head  only WHEN THE DATA IS NOT ON THEIR SIDE and then invoke the gaps we  have in all sciences as an excuse.

NO ONE of any significance in the creation side makes the argument - aha  ""gaps"" therefore  God there lurks. **Thats just lying for Dawkins.** Instead we make the logical argument that some things indicate logic/intelligence over random and little evidence is against that conclusion.   A classic example is abiogenesis. All the available evidence indicates at the moment that naturalism just isn't working as a solution.  concrete FACT.  We have been at it around 80 years and its gotten no better.

We are found guilty of  G of G because the data **does show** naturalism hasn't worked, that life is incredibly complex and thus  is more likely not  a ""designoid"" but  the perfectly rational alternative - designed.  It talks like  a design. It rationally looks like a design so it is rational to consider the possibility it is a design - the only  response of the atheists is  - we will find out later its not designed just  trust us - if you don't - Aha God of the gaps!

another classic use of fallacious use of god of the gaps accusations? I'll keep is short because this post is long enough. I don't think I have found an online atheist yet  who when backed into a corner doesn't bend all logic and rationality to avoid a supernatural beginning to reality. the logic is solid and the evidence is overwhelming.

How many times have I heard from atheists that there may in fact be a solution to  nature creating itself naturally (along with hilarious claims that quantum fields are not the very nature that existed previously  in order to create itself)? countless and when I ask them for such a possible solution they say they don't know  but not accepting their totally empty  imagination of the future discoveries of science is  a - you guessed it - God of the gaps argument.

So yes G of G arguments as used by atheists are  often based on imagination, are fallacious and are  the TRULY absurd argument.   Creationist and theist need to be better at pushing back such an obvious fallacious argument. Its one of their key memes to back up a lack of evidence that has failed for 90% of the population in being convincing of atheism.

DebateEvolution,9fze2t,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,r/creation on 'God of the Gaps',"Our favourite creationist posted this thread on r/creation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/9ftu6q/evidence_against_evolution_common_descent_or/

In that thread Sal, and a couple of other creationists, try to defend the use of god of the gaps argument, saying they're not actually fallacious. Which is of course absurdly wrong.

First of all, let's define exactly what a god of the gaps argument is. As the name suggests, it's finding a gap in knowledge, and saying that having that gap in knowledge means that a god must have been the cause.

It's not the same thing as actual positive evidence. For example, Sal say's that if the Earth was proven to be young, that would be evidence for Biblical creation. And I agree. If we were able to prove that the Earth was 6,000 years old, that would be positive evidence. Because that's direct support of a claim.

One major problem that creationists have when forming these arguments is a massively inconsistent standard of knowledge. When it comes to evolution, or anything natural, they demand evidence, and a lot of it. You have to show a clear succession of fossils, with DNA evidence, and a full mutation by mutation pathway. Knowledge about evolution is only knowledge if it's absolute certainty.

But when it comes to their own beliefs their standards for evidence are...pretty much non-existent. They just say that God created it. That's really it. Just a claim, a series of words, is knowledge, according to them.

Make no mistake. Whenever you see a theist talk about something we don't know, they don't know either. They are not responding to a lack of certain knowledge and evidence with knowledge and evidence of their own. They are responding with a claim. And it's a very easy claim to make. Anyone can claim someone created something, but backing up that claim with evidence is a lot harder.

Now onto some of the actual claims from the creationists in that thread:

From /u/stcordova:

&gt; The reason I raised that hypothetical scenario is to show a paradox. For them to accept God as Creator, they might need a God-of-the-Gaps miracle to persuade them there is a Miracle Maker. They could appeal endlessly to some possible undiscovered entity or ""natural explanation"" to explain the miracle, but the problem for them is that if the miracle was actually REAL, their policy of appealing to some ""undiscovered natural mechanism"" would prevent them from ascenting to the truth. 

If we observed an actual miracle, that would not be God of the Gaps, depending on what said miracle was of course. That miracle would be positive evidence. And that's a very different thing to the God of the Gaps claims that creationists regularly make. Not knowing how life began is not the same thing as observing a miracle. Not knowing the mutation pathway of every complex biological feature is not the same thing as observing a miracle. Not knowing what every single DNA base does, and how every single amino acid effects the proteins it's part of is not he same thing as observing a miracle. You get the picture.

&gt; The problem of appealing to some yet-to-be-discovered explanation has relation to problems in math where Godel proved that there are truths that are formally unprovable but must be accepted on faith.

Not really. Faith is belief without regarding evidence or reason. And like it or not, it's perfectly fine to believe in something because it's a package deal with your other beliefs. You don't need evidence for each and every part of it just to say it's not faith based. I don't believe in gods. For a number of reasons, I believe this is not a faith based position, but an evidence and logic based one. Thus, the other logical conclusions that result from my atheism are also not faith based. I would grant theists the same concessions, by the way, if their beliefs were not based on faith.

&gt; I pointed out to OddJackdaw that his claims that abiogenesis and evolution are true are not based on direct observation, on validated chemical scenarios, but on FAITH acceptance in something unknown, unproven, unseen, likely unknowable, and inconsistent with known laws of physics and chemistry! 

That's the problem; abiogenesis isn't inconsistent with known laws of physics and chemistry. It's not something we know is wrong, or impossible. It's just something we don't know. And remember, as I said above, theists don't know either. They do not have a better explanation to replace that gap with.

From u/mike_enders:

&gt; In Science we go with the best explanation we have based on the state of evidence at the time. We don't invoke imaginary evidence of what will be found at a later date.

Remember what I said before: the creationist's claims are not better explanations. They don't have more evidence. They don't have demonstrated mechanisms. They're just empty claims. We don't need to invoke evidence that might be found, we just need to say that their explanations have much less evidence (or none what so ever).

From /u/nestergoesbowling:

&gt; when folks claim there must be some yet-to-be-discovered natural explanation. That observation resonates with something Matt Leisola discussed: Materialists think that because we continue to make discoveries about the natural world, the pool of known mysteries must be shrinking toward zero. Instead, whole landscapes of new mystery present themselves to science precisely when some major new discovery is achieved, like the explorer reaching the crest of a mountain and finding a new realm before him.

Though he's right about science constantly expanding its horizons, and with it the amount of unknown and undiscovered things, that's not a supportive argument for creationist claims. As of yet, exactly zero of these discoveries have been a religious supernatural answer. It's pretty obvious where that trend is going.

It's clear that the creationist gets very hopeful that with each new unknown field, they might finally find the piece of evidence that reverses that trend. Something that finally warrants a supernatural answer, instead of a natural one. That's why creationists, including Sal, spend so much time on molecular biology arguments. They stopped asking for pathways for wings and eyes, because we know enough about those things to give solid answers. But the function of each enzyme and protein is not known, and thus it's much easier to make an irreducible complexity argument in that field.

&gt; And the evidence for God is directly proportional to the ever-increasing size of those gaps

Let's do the maths on this one. The amount of evidence for the supernatural we have now is zero. Back when we knew less about the world the evidence was also zero. So the amount of evidence for God = Evidence x zero. Wow, he's right, it is directly proportional!

https://discord.gg/QsMpP9U

Chat is not the best forum for debate, so instead of calling it the *Debate* evolution discord, it is the *Discuss* evolution discord. The goal is that for the most part this will be focused on *polite* discussion rather than Creationists yelling at us all about how we are wrong. To achieve that, we have four channels:

* **General discussion:**  
Questions about evolution, as well as sincere, non-inflammatory questions about why we believe evolution instead of creationism. Generally unmoderated, but this is not the channel for creationist rants. *Overtly pro-creationist comments and ""[JAQing off](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions)"" in this channel may result in a ban.* Use the thunderdome channel for that sort of thing.
 
* **Evolution Lounge:**  
Invite only channel for people on the pro-evolution side. A place to vent about your frustrations dealing with the stupid arguments from the other side. You will automatically be added to this channel once we assume you are on our side. 

* **Creation Lounge**  
Same as above but for the creationists. Vent about what idiots the rest of us are. Just be aware that the admins can read the messages in this channel and we reserve the right to post them in the other channels if we want. Don't like that? Make your own server! We'll even tell you how to do so if you ask (It's really easy).

* **Thunderdome:**  
Open season. Creationists, post your ~~bad~~ best arguments and tell us why we are wrong. I'm sure you will convince us. Really. 

Some ways I would like to see this used:

* Writing a response to a post, but you are unsure about something? Post it and we'll try to help.
* Maybe we can have ""group watches"" of debates and lectures posted to youtube and discuss them. 
* Have a homework question on a related topic? We won't do your homework, but maybe we can help you understand. 
* And who knows what else. 

Right now this is just an experiment, but if it goes well, we'll see if the mods want to add it to the sidebar as a permanent feature.

To give an idea of the literature out there from Creationists on this perspective (I'm not interested in debunking these articles specifically, I'm more interested in discussing the concepts described above and applying the concept to the best idea of the very first living organism that could reproduce):

**TL;DR** This brainiac chemist-computer scientist says that evolution is impossible because:

&gt;…I simply do not understand, chemically, how macroevolution could have happened. Hence, am I not free to join the ranks of the skeptical and to sign such a statement without reprisals from those that disagree with me? … Does anyone understand the chemical details behind macroevolution? If so, I would like to sit with that person and be taught, so I invite them to meet with me.

Admittedly, I'm stupid about this stuff and I don't really understand what the fuck this chemist is talking about. I have a very oversimplified understanding of biological evolution. The way I usually explain it is: *specimens born with mutations that are helpful to their survival survive and copulate such that the mutation becomes more widespread and the mutants outlive the disadvantaged ancestors.* I understand that mutations happen 1-2 DNA letters at a time, and I understand that a group of organisms can evolve so that they become more distant to their ancestors. Thus, I understand that a group of organisms can evolve so that they become biologically a different species from their ancestors--i.e. they can no longer reproduce with the initial gene pool. Am I missing something?

I did post here recently, and I received a lot of great advice, but my creationist parents are being kinda not rational about this. And they're telling me that I'm the one who's being obtuse and ridiculous. Nothing that I show them as evidence--ring species, fossils, various specimens developing entire different organs--matters to them because ""we've never observed a species turning into another species.""

I've tried to explain that macroevolution is the same as microevolution, and the only difference is the amount of time they occur across, but they'll insist that somehow micro and macro evolution are entirely different. And then today my mom pulled this thing out of her ass about how there are extra chemical changes involved for a species to gradually evolve into another species, and I...am completely lost. Idk maybe I am the stupid one here.

DebateEvolution,9djzr9,zezemind,Evolutionary Biologist,t2_c4bcg77,self.DebateEvolution,,Polonium radiohalos in sandstone,"Anyone know about this claim of ""successful prediction"" by Andrew Snelling? (Relevant part in bold)

&gt;Uranium is an unstable radioactive element. In laboratories today, the most common form of uranium decays very slowly in a predictable way. During this “decay chain,” other fast-decaying elements, such as polonium, appear briefly—a blip on the radar, as it were.
As radioactive atoms decay, they shoot out millions of particles that damage the surrounding minerals. Since the particles shoot out in random directions, the radiation damage forms a sphere around the radioactive atoms. Viewed in cross section, the damage looks like a halo, which gives us the name “radioactive halo,” or radiohalo for short.
We find not just radiohalos made from uranium but other types of radiohalos nearby, including those formed by the decay of polonium. That’s a problem. Polonium, which forms by the decay of uranium, lasts only a short time before it’s gone. Yet the rock record reveals both uranium and polonium radiohalos near each other—frozen in time. How can polonium separate itself from the uranium before the polonium decays?
When radioactive polonium decays, it leaves circles of damage, known as a radiohalos. Since polonium is a short-lived product of uranium decay, it normally disappears without a trace. But Andrew Snelling predicted that the Flood produced unique conditions that allowed water to carry polonium away from the decaying uranium. As predicted, he found polonium radiohalos in rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains.
Snelling believed that special conditions during the Flood would explain this strange phenomenon in granites. (Granites form from magma as it rises near the earth’s surface and then cools.) If true, these conditions provide rock-solid evidence that many physical processes sped up during the Flood.
If large volumes of hot water seeped rapidly enough through uranium-bearing granite as it formed, then this water would carry the polonium away from the uranium before the polonium decayed.
The magma that originally formed the uranium-bearing granite was initially a scorching 1200–1330°F (650–705°C). Since radiohalos break down at temperatures above 302°F (150°C), the granite would have to cool within two weeks, not millions of years. Otherwise, we would not see radiohalos in the present.
In 2003, Snelling published his findings and proposed his model for the rapid water transport of polonium (see Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Creationism, pp. 243–267). In 2008 he continued to chip away at the problem and added the expectation of rapid cooling of the granite.
**He then went a step further and applied his model to another type of rock. In a 2008 paper, Snelling predicted that polonium radiohalos should also be found in certain sedimentary rocks that were transformed when the earth’s plates crashed together during the Flood. At the right pressure and temperature, chemical reactions would release enough water to transport polonium away from uranium. He predicted that radiohalos would be most frequent at this pressure and temperature, and decrease in frequency away from this point.**
**Later in 2008 Snelling identified a spot in the Great Smoky Mountains, near Cherokee, North Carolina, where colliding plates produced just the right conditions. Better yet, the sandstone there contained minerals that could preserve any radiohalos that had been produced. Additionally, the sandstone was thick enough to allow him to gather other samples a great distance away where conditions wouldn’t have been as favorable. When he extracted minerals and examined them under a microscope, the highest frequency of polonium radiohalos came from places where the earth’s collisions generated the greatest volume of water, as expected.**
**No one had predicted anything like this before because it did not fit conventional evolutionary assumptions. Confirmation of Snelling’s prediction not only verified his model for the rapid formation of polonium radiohalos, but it also indicated that the sandstones must have been changed (metamorphosed) within two weeks during the Flood, not over millions of years.**

The Jetsons was on tv,  and the space race was at its height, I suppose I’m simply showing my true colours: I’m a bit of a spacenerd, and I'm too young to remember the 'duck and cover' drills my parents endured.  During the same period, an very import discovery of earth systems was also made, a key piece of evidence for what is arguably the most important geological theory was discovered in the oceans inky depths.

Welcome to the second instalment of [The present is the key to the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9ckfpe/on_the_idiocracy_of_observational_vs_historical/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit). In the first instalment we looked at two ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconformity) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic) very basic pieces, and a third [more complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding) one that we very much glossed over as we briefly touched on why ‘historical vs observational science’ is to be charitable a misnomer. 

Today we’re going ~~dive~~ skim two pieces of evidence from very different disciplines of geology that apply to the theory of plate tectonics: Earth’s magnetosphere and palaeontology. 

Warfare has long been a driving force of invention.  The first half of this story is no different.  During the second world war tools to read changes in magnetism were used to [locate submarines](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/developing.html). These devices were altered and used to map the sea floor, as it was known that [basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt), a key part of the oceanic crust often contains [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite).

Much to the surprise of the researches, [the magnetic poles of the rock alternated between ‘normal’ or with the southern magnetic pole located at Earth's north pole, and the northern magnetic pole being near Earth's southern pole, and reversed, were the north magnetic pole is at the north pole of the earth, and the southern magnetic pole is near the south pole.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#Magnetic_poles). In order for a rock to be magnetized ([clearly, this is a simple explanation, because like ICP, I also don’t understand how magnets work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs)), the rock must first be hotter than its [Curie Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature#Materials_with_magnetic_moments_that_change_properties_at_the_Curie_temperature), once this happens the magnetic spins aligns with the earth’s magnetic field.  Once the mineral cools below it’s Currie temperature, that magnetic signature is locked in, giving us a glimpse into the history of earth’s magnetic field.  Rocks really do hold surprising secrets. 

Now leaving behind the mind destroying field of geophysics for a second, let’s actually look at what’s observable in the dirt without some fancy equipment. Palaeontologists have found fossilized [mesosaurus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosaurus#Distribution),  [Cynognathus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynognathus#Provenance), and [Lystrosaurus](Lystrosaurus) in both Africa and South America. As I’m sure someone is going to come up with some insane idea of how these animals would somehow make it across the ocean, or some other equally insane idea to explain this amazing fossil range, we’re going to identify one more fossil.  Glossopteris[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossopteris] is a plant, a fern to be exact.  It’s found in both Africa and South America, as well as India, Australia, and Antarctica. The seed of the Glossopteris is large, and therefor was not windblown great distances, or is likely to floated great distances. 

So we have two bits of evidence, first the zebra patterned magnetic ‘stripes’ on the oceanic crust, and secondly very similar fossil assemblages on either side of the Atlantic ocean. We also know there is the [Mid Atlantic Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge), you can go see it for yourself in [Þingvellir Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Þingvellir), I’ve been fortunate enough to have been there twice, both times were equally amazing. This ridge creates new oceanic crust, widening the Atlantic ocean

Finally we have one more important tidbit of information, there is no [subduction zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) on the Eastern side of the Americas, nor on the Western side of Africa, so we know the sea floor spreading from the Mid Atlantic Ridge without anywhere to go. 

We’ve briefly gone over the evidence, and the links are there for anyone who wishes to dive deeper into any of the subject discussed.  I’ll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions of what historical events left these clues for us to find.

If I may be so bold, I’d like to recommend an episode of Sean Carroll’s Mindscape [Mike Brown on Killing Pluto and Replacing It with Planet 9](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/08/27/episode-11-mike-brown-on-killing-pluto-and-replacing-it-with-planet-9/) As a self identified space nerd it was great to go on a short tour of our solar system, before diving a bit deeper into what may be just out of sight. More importantly to this subreddit, the themes of the scientific methods ability to correct errors, the ability to admit ‘I was wrong, or I didn’t know’ and the fear of being ostracized for suggesting a claim that is counter to the momentum of the field are all discussed. 

Once again, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. Constructive feedback of both the content and the writing is appreciated.

These arches are collapsing at an alarming rate; in Utah's Arches National Park, there are more than 2000 known arches... well, 2000 minus 43, which is the number that have collapsed between 1970 and 2015. Majestic \[wall arch\]([http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081000492.html](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081000492.html)), the then-11th largest arch in the park, totally collapsed during the night of August 4-5, 2008.

These structures are supposed to be 5 million years old, according to old-age geologic dating. Yet, in the last 45 years, the park lost 2.15% of its arches!

DebateEvolution,9d9ht8,CombustibleGoat,,t2_jsoeq,self.DebateEvolution,,Help me debate my creationist family,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My family sent me this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdqYPjA9VxA&amp;t=191s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdqYPjA9VxA&amp;t=191s) . I can tell honestly by the title alone it's trash - it clickbaity and dishonest. Not only this, but there is a distinct lack of references. However, I simply don't know the science to refute the claims, which is why I need your help. I realise the video is around 30 mins long, which I doubt anyone can be bothered to watch, so I'll summarise the list of points and references they use to make it quicker and easier. It goes as follows:

1. Soft tissue in dinosaur bones which are 10s of millions of years old.

Mary Higby Schweitzer discovered dinosaur tissue by accidentally dissolving too much of the bone, this tissue is elastic. Being a fossil there should be nothing left. Finding tissue is expected to be only of modern bone (although they don't say how modern).  It also says that 'scientist Mark Armitage fired for making dinosaur soft tissue discovery' (I suppose implying that evolutionists are cult-ish and any counter evidence is bad/ignored). This poses radical challenge to the existing rules of science that tissue cannot survive even a million years. Examples they give are an 80 million year old duckbill, and a triceratops found in Montana. These are full of bone osteocytes. It shouldn't be able to remain present for millions of years surrounded by oxygen and water.

2. Carbon-14

If the Earth were one giant ball of c-14, in 1 million years, the entire ball would be gone. Yet 'they' are finding c-14 in dinosaur bones (don't know who 'they' is). Dinosaur bone is much smaller than the entire Earth to top it off. This proves that what you are testing is not very old (due to c-14's nature). Such a discovery implies that a dinosaur cannot be 68 million years old. Finding c-14 would suggest an age in the range of Egyptian mummies. At 7:32 in the video it shows a table (not giving any sources) about c-14 in dinosaur bones.

3. Amino acids in dinosaur egg shells

There are left handed amino acids in dinosaur egg shells, these, apparently shouldn't be here. They should be '50-50'. Moreover,10 dinosaurs from multiple different continents were c-14 tested at the world's leading labs, they then showed the results. The american geophysical union censored their paper (I'm not sure who, sorry). They did this because they claimed that they're getting measurable c-14 from dinosaur bones all over the world (not actually sure what this implies).

4. Science of protein decay

In a lab, experiments have demonstrated that proteins and tissues shouldn't last even a million years. (no references)

5. Palaeontology

Professor Roberto Fondi from the university of Sienna explains that bacteria and blue-green algae to men appear abruptly in the fossil record without any connection. So why do so many people think that fossils prove evolution? After nearly two centuries of research, the paleontological evidence for evolution is not only rare, but highly questionable. If evolution were really true, the evidence would be in abundance and incontestable. There is no evidence of transitional fossils. There is no indication that the situation will change in the future. At 13:35 they go through a list of transitional fossils, and say these are very far from conclusive.

6. Not 'biofilm' or contaminated

Mary has been able to replicate her findings suggesting that what she is working with is not contaminated. It continues saying a piece of triceratops bone has been decalcified so that all the bone is removed, and you can see blood vessels and soft tissue on top (At 23:20). Temperature change will change molecular motions causing it to degrade and decompose. At 25 minutes, they demonstrate soft fibred bone being peeled away which are full of cells. You can see blood vessels and see tiny little cells (At 25:10). Furthermore, one cannot argue that iron has preserved this tissue since we don't see this iron preservation in any recent remains - why doesn't iron preserve soft tissue that are only a few thousand years old? Iron from the blood (which is no way near these osteocytes) therefore cannot have preserved the tissue. Moreover, iron-oxides are incredibly reactive as well. There is no method we know of to preserve tissue for such a long time. 

Sorry this is a bit here and there, I wrote it as I watched the video (showing really how badly the argument is structurally organised). The lack of sources, poorly structured arguments and more show that its a load of bs, but I can't scientifically explain why with counter-evidence or explanations. I would be really grateful if you lot could help me. :)

Comprehensive report on the critique of the Darwinian theory of evolution in biochemistry

&amp;#x200B;

Criticism of the theory of Darwinian evolution in biochemistry

&amp;#x200B;

The theory of evolution of Charles Darwin lost credibility almost entirely at the approach of the twenty-first century, and this theory was adopted by some of the believers in material thought at the beginning of the twentieth century and tried to teach them to people and worked to prove their validity and imposed on it is a scientific fact fixed but these attempts failed and proved bankrupt The main factor behind the failure of this theory is the great development of some branches of science that are directly related to this theory, such as microbiology, biochemistry and paleontology. It was proved after this development in these sciences that life did not arise by accident and did not develop step by step as this theory claims and proved impossible to adopt this idea originally (for more details please see the chapter ""error theory of evolution""). This bankrupt theory failed to produce convincing scientific evidence on the origin of living species,

This particular deficit made believers in this theory in real trouble. This book explains and analyzes the ""sacrifice of living beings"" as a characteristic characteristic of some living beings. 

This sacrifice can be seen in nature constantly, and the symbiosis and cooperation between living beings can be seen clearly in addition to the compassion in the relations between them. All these natural phenomena posed questions to the theory of ""evolution"" and could not answer them, wondering what caused it?

Darwin's theory was based on an intellectual mechanism whose essence lay in the concept of natural selection, a mechanism that did not rely primarily on criticism or objective transference. Darwin thought that the origin of all living species was due to one grandfather and their presence in different natural conditions, And that the species that have shown adaptable according to the natural conditions in which they found have acquired new qualities inherited to the strains that came after it, for this reason, the species that showed adaptation are stronger for responding to the strength of the surrounding conditions and succeeded in survival and continuity, Though Razia Darwin expressed this to remain the strongest of any powerful individuals fit to stay alive and vulnerable are exposed to the courtyard.

Nature in the light of this hypothesis can be defined according to the statement of Julian Huxley, a friend close to Darwin and strongly advocates his theory as follows: ""is the arena of the selection of the strongest and the most effective of the weakest and failed, and inevitably this selection."" 

The question arises: Is it true that nature as claimed by the owners of the theory of evolution is the arena where the victory of the strongest and fittest and crush the weakest and presents to the courtyard with the utmost selfishness and strength as a form of life? .

This question can be answered by observing the forms of life in nature, and it is natural for organisms in nature to make an effort to live and defend themselves, since every living organism must hunt to preserve its life or defend itself, but the natural theater of the living Consists only of these two scenes, but it is possible to observe scenes in nature that speak of the most precious types of sacrifice carried out by animals for the benefit of their offspring and their communities or even towards animals or other species. In addition to sacrifice, the symbiosis and cooperation or the taking of another animal and the work to save it is a behavioral characteristic that can be seen in the world of nature.

These behavioral features in the world of nature were unable to explain the reasons for their occurrence, and proved that nature is not the scene of war as it is claimed that life in nature has proved the bankruptcy of the theory of evolution and its impotence completely, for example: Why Zebra (Zebra) fleeing from his predators And the strange behavior of the fish ""Atarina"" as we will see in the coming chapters, they endanger their life from the water to the sandy shores of whitening However, it is Natural selection could not be removed from the theater of nature. In the coming pages you will find something that makes you feel puzzled and surprised by animals that are irrational and irrational, It is only man who is fair and fair who can return the origin of these distinct behaviors to the creative and knowledgeable God alone in his creation, because the Almighty says in his clear book: ""The difference of night and day and the revelation of God from heaven. They are wise. "" ""Al-Jathiyyah, verse 4""

One of the dilemmas faced by the theory of evolution: logical behavior of animals. 

It is known that man is the only living being governed by rationality and logic in behavior. In addition to his physical characteristics, the unique advantage that made him on a different level from the rest of living beings is reason and logic. In light of this, man is characterized by self-accountability, thinking, planning, The act towards the events taking place and the reflection, as well as walking towards a specific goal all these behavioral qualities especially human. Other living organisms in nature do not have these qualities. For this reason, we can not expect the animals to have patterns of behavior similar to humans such as planning and assessment or to do some calculations like those of some engineers. 

So, how can we answer some of the logical behavioral phenomena in nature?

Even some animals that are characterized by these logical behaviors do not have a brain at all, and before answering this question must be closely acquainted with some of these behaviors to know but these behaviors and its origin.",18,1536043675,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9ct6wz/is_this_true_i_do_know_most_of_those_disproving/

“The present is the key to the past” 

-	Sir Charles Lyell

I make a living insuring oil wells get drilled were they are supposed to be drilled.  Unfortunately, it’s not as exciting as the documentary ‘Armageddon’ makes it look.  I spend my time looking at ground up rocks under a microscope, watching traces on computer screens, doing paper work, and missing my family, to date NASA has not approached me, although I suspect I’d be forced say that even they had…

Ultimately the most important thing I do is make educated decisions based of an incomplete data set using the principles of geology to fill in the gaps. Two users of this subreddit (/u/PaulDPrice and /u/No-Karma-II) recently brought up a term I first heard in the Hamm vs Nye debate, observational vs historical science.  This claim is a slap in the face to at the very least every geologist, as well as anyone else who uses observations today to explain the past.

Clearly (and sadly I might add) we don’t have a time machine to go back and see such wonders as the [Burgess Shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale) or the [Solnhofen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solnhofen_Limestone) or other [Lagerstätte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerstätte) shortly before their burial. Thus we must combine the observations of current depositional events with observations of the rock record.  Some observations are trivial, my wife who has become rather annoyed with my hobby of looking at outcrops rather than the view on hikes can spot an [unconformity]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconformity) and has even been known to point them out on occasion. 

Slightly more complex than an unconformity is the sedimentary structure known as cross bedding.  [Cross bedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-bedding#Trough_cross-beds) occurs on inclined [bedforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedform) when flow occurs, generally water or wind. These formations can tell us directional of flow, or paleocurrent, weather deposition occurred in a river, a tide dominated setting, a shallow marine environment etc. Finally these structures can be used as ‘way up’ markers for over turned beds. One of the best things about cross bedding is it can be observed as it forms in nature and in a [laboratory setting]( https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-110-sedimentary-geology-spring-2007/lecture-notes/ch3.pdf).

Finally lets look a [glacial erratic’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic).  While there are other types of erratic’s, glacial erratic’s are the coolest simply because of their scale.  During periods of glaciation giant boulders are entrained within the ice flow, only to be deposited later on.  These rocks have clearly been transported long distances.  Today in areas of ice flows we can still see this occurring.  

I’ll stop here, as I don’t think anyone will want to read brief overviews of basic geology, and we’re off topic, but I hope I’ve at least touched three examples were the observations today clearly show a gap in deposition, direction and method of flow, as well as a way up indicator to identify overturned beds, and finally a very easy to spot sign that an area was exposed to glaciation. 

Without applying the observations that have been made recently to our models, industries such as agriculture, oil and gas, mining,  construction, technology, pharmaceuticals , etc. would all be at best shadows of their current selves, at worst impossible.  

As such I implore you, if you wish to criticize evolution, wonderful, everyone should be skeptical.  Being an informed skeptic equally as important.

If you'll allow me to preach to the choir: Even putting aside the fossil record, genetics, etc, no one can observe the great apes and honestly deny that we are the same type of creature.

It's just so in your face that even a creationist would have to admit that man was created in the physical image of an ape.

Instead, what I want to get to the bottom of is: does natural selection really explain how species arise (not where they came from)

Feyman said ""what I cannot create I do not understand"". Meaning, it's easy to postulate a mechanism, but what proves you understand something is if you can build an instantiation of it that behaves as you expect.  I think the field of [artificial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life#Software-based_(%22soft%22)) is going to be the final test of the theory of natural selection, because obviously there's no other way to test the theories in real time.

And as of date, while there evolutionary computation has some some success on ""search and optimization"" (genetic algorithms) and some intriguing simple forms of creativity (like Karl Sims famous evolved creatues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBgG_VSP7f8), no one has demonstrated a system that produces open ended evolution with increasing complexity even approaching what we find in biology.

I quote from a recent paper by Ken Stanley (a giant in the field of evolutionary computing.

""A full understanding of open-ended evolutionary dynamics
remains elusive. While artificial life worlds have been proposed
to study such dynamics and tests have been devised to
try to detect them, no theory yet has enumerated the key conditions that are essential to inducing them.""

One of these is the pacific golden plover.

The pacific golden plover winters in Hawaii, but migrates to Alaska, among other places, to breed. This journey is a grueling 3-day nonstop journey. Ornithologists find that this trip requires that the bird be spectacularly efficient in fat consumption in order to complete this journey. They put on an extra 50% of bodyweight in fat prior to the trip, and consume exactly that much in an 88-hour, 32-MPH nonstop flight of 2800 miles. Good thing, since they can’t swim or even float, and there are no islands *en route*. Calculations seemed to show that they were not efficient enough at flying, even though they are an order of magnitude more efficient than a jet plane, to make this trip, until research showed that they save 23% of their energy by flying in formation, taking turns at the inefficient “point” position. But that’s not the evolution-defying part.

Upon arrival in Alaska, the birds court, mate and breed. After the hatchlings fledge, the adults leave *en masse* for Hawaii, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Weeks later, the young congregate and depart, without anyone who has ever made the trip before. They must navigate to a tiny dot in the middle of an expansive and hostile ocean with no waypoints, and must deal with inclement weather and variable winds blowing them off course.

This is the part that defies gradualistic, evolutionary explanation: the Hawaiian Islands have always been a lonely, isolated dot in the middle of a vast, featureless ocean. They did not move slowly away from some seacoast so that the plover could develop its physical and navigational capabilities gradualistically. Most islands, like the Galapagos Islands, are isolated from the rest of the world and form their own ecosystem. Yet the pacific golden plover is uniquely and specifically equipped for this migratory mission!",96,1535553450,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b9u2y/the_pacific_golden_plover_defies_gradualistic/

I’m only 15 and have been raised with creationist science materials, so my understanding of evolutionary science (as well as cosmology and some geology) is shaky at best. So I apologize for my stupidity on the subject; I know that I have no idea what I’m talking about, but I’m trying to learn. Recently, I’ve gotten into a debate with my parents, who are staunch creationists; it’s been really fucking frustrating. I’d love a response to any of these points that you can help with. Thank you in advance.

**Claims from Creationists**

- The flagellum of certain bacteria is too complex to have evolved, as it functions like an outboard motor.

- The Cambrian explosion requires such a sudden, rapid of a growth in the population and number of species that it couldn’t have happened.

- It would be “nearly impossible” for amino acids to link together in exactly the right order to create life. According to Jay Wile, the chances of this occurring naturally are 1 in 10^152.

- DNA is too complex to have formed from evolution. *Any information on how DNA could have arisen would be great.*

**Creationists’ Arguments Against Evolution**

- There have been no “proven” transitional fossils (they don’t accept archaeopteryx or Lucy). Or else the fossil record does not hold up under scrutiny, and not enough fossils of transitional species are found.

- *This seems off-topic, but* can anyone share information on the accuracy and application of radioactive dating methods—such as carbon-14, rubidium-strontium, potassium-argon, and uranium-lead? I bring this up because I often see it argued in creationist materials that such dating methods are highly inaccurate, and this is one of the reasons they won’t accept the evidence in the fossil record.

**Arguments my Parents Make**

- I tried to explain to my mom how we’ve observed huge changes in species over brief periods of time—such as in dog breeding.

&gt;Well, that’s within a species! There’s no evidence of one species evolving into something else.

- So I made an argument like this: a species is a group of animals that can only breed within itself to produce sterile offspring. A species can, by mutation and selection, gradually change over time to become more distantly related to its ancestors. Therefore, it is possible for one species to evolve into a new species (a population which can only breed within itself).

&gt;THAT’S JUST SPECULATION

- She wants evidence of one species literally changing into another. **Does this indisputable evidence exist, and if so, can anyone provide it for me?** Otherwise, I’d greatly appreciate any counters to her absurdity lol, because I’m at my wit’s end. She also told me I was “changing definitions” by saying that microevolution and macroevolution are the same process over different time spans.

- I sent her [this article] (https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/evolution-and-natural-selection/a/lines-of-evidence-for-evolution). In response, she said we had to “back up” and she sent me [this] (https://creation.com/not-to-be-used-again-homologous-structures-and-the-presumption-of-originality-as-a-critical-value). She also sent me [this piece of shit] (http://www.mhrc.net/why.htm), but honestly I don’t even recommend that you waste time reading it.

- *Another off-topic question.* My parents are trying to say that the Universe had to have been designed because the second law of thermodynamics says that order cannot come from chaos. I tried to counter this by saying that the Universe is chaotic, and that gravity is the only order (of sorts) that we have. But they went “Aha!” and tried to corner me on that point.../facepalm/. How do I even argue this? Their only evidence for an “orderly Universe” is that everything orbits a greater mass, and that our solar system is “perfectly balanced” (bullfuckingshit), but I guess that’s enough for them.",52,1535550324,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b9exs/anyone_want_to_help_me_debate_creationists/
DebateEvolution,9b6207,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"""Genetic Entropy"" is BS: A Summary","The idea of “genetic entropy” is one of a very few “scientific” ideas to come from creationists. It’s the idea that humanity must be very young because harmful mutations are accumulating at a rate that will ultimately lead to our extinction, and so we, as a species, can’t be any older than a few thousand years. Therefore, creation. John Sanford proposed and tried to support this concept in his book “Genetic Entropy &amp; The Mystery of the Genome,” which is…wow it’s bad. 

Everything about the genetic entropy argument is wrong, including the term itself. But it comes up over and over and over, since it’s one of the few science-y-sounding creationist arguments out there, so join me as we quickly cover each reason why. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m going to do this in two parts. First we’ll have a bunch of quick points, and after, I’ll elaborate on the ones that merit a longer explanation. Each point will be labeled “P1”, “P2”, etc., as will each longer explanation. So if you want to find the long version, just control-f the P# for that point. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P1**: “Genetic entropy” is a made-up term invented by creationists to describe a concept that already existed: Error catastrophe. Even before it’s a vaguely scientific idea, the term “genetic entropy” is an attempt at branding, to make a process seem more dangerous or inevitable through changing the name. I’m going to use the term “error catastrophe” from here on when we’re talking about the actual population genetics phenomenon, and “genetic entropy” when talking about the silly creationist idea.

&amp;nbsp;

**P2**: Error catastrophe has never been observed or documented in nature or experimentally. In order to conclusively demonstrate error catastrophe, you must show these two things: That harmful mutations accumulate in a population *over generations*, and that these mutations cause a terminal decline in fitness, meaning that they cause the average reproductive output to fall below 1, meaning the population is shrinking, and will ultimately go extinct. 

This has never been demonstrated. There have been attempts to induce error catastrophe experimentally, and Sanford claims that H1N1 experienced error catastrophe during the 20th century, but all of these attempts have been unsuccessful and Sanford is wrong about H1N1 in every way possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P3**: The process through which genetic entropy supposedly occur is inherently contradictory. Either neutral mutations are not selected against and therefore accumulate, or harmful mutations are selected against, and therefore don’t accumulate. Mutations cannot simultaneously hurt fitness and not be selected against. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P4**: As deleterious mutations build up, the percentage of possible subsequent mutations that are harmful decreases, and the percentage of possible beneficial mutations increases. The simplest illustration is to look at a single site. Say a C mutates to a T and that this is harmful. Well now that harmful CT mutation is off the table, and a new beneficial TC mutation is possible. So over time, as harmful mutations accumulate, beneficial mutations become more likely. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P5**: (Somewhat related to P4) A higher mutation rate provides more chances to find beneficial mutations, so even though more harmful mutations will occur, they are more likely to be selected out by novel beneficial genotypes that are found and selected for. This is slightly different from P4, which was about the proportion of mutations; this is just raw numbers. More mutations means more beneficial mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P6**: Sanford is dishonest. His work surrounding “genetic entropy” is riddled with glaring inaccuracies that are either deliberate misrepresentations, or the result of such egregious ignorance that it qualifies as dishonesty. 

Two of the most glaring examples are his misrepresentation of a distribution of fitness effects produced by Motoo Kimura, and his portrayal of H1N1 fitness over time.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Below this point you’ll find more details for some of the above points.**

&amp;nbsp;

**P2**: Error catastrophe has never been observed, experimentally nor in nature. There have been a number of attempts at inducing error catastrophe experimentally, but none have been successful. Some work from [Crotty et al.]( http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6895.short) is notable in that they *claimed* to have induced error catastrophe, but actually only maybe documented lethal mutagenesis, a broader term that refers to any situation in which a large number of mutations cause death or extinction. Their single round of mutagenic treatment of infectious genomes necessarily could not involve mutation accumulation over generations, and so while mutations my have caused the fitness decline, it isn’t wasn’t through error catastrophe. It’s also possible the observed fitness costs were due to something else entirely, since the mutagen they used [has many effects]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rmv.483).

J.J. Bull and his team have also worked extensively on this question, and outline their work and the associated challenges [here](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541). In short, they were not able to demonstrate terminal fitness decline due to mutation accumulation over generations, and in one series of experiments [actually observed fitness *gains* during mutagenic treatment of bacteriophages]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879444/).

You’ll notice that all of that work involves bacteriophages and mutagenic treatment. What about humans? Well, phages are the ideal targets for lethal mutagenesis, especially RNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages. These organisms have mutation and substitution rates [orders of magnitude higher than double-stranded DNA viruses and cellular organisms]( http://www.origem.info/FIC/pdf/Duffy%20et%20al%20Rates%20of%20Evol%20Change_Nat%20Rev%20Gen08.pdf) (pdf). They also have small, dense genome, meaning that there are very few intergenic regions, most of which contain regulatory elements, and even some of the reading frames are overlapping and offset, which means there are regions with no wobble sites. 

This means that deleterious mutations should be a higher percentage of the mutation spectrum compared to, say, the human genome. So mutations happening faster plus more likely to be harmful equals ideal targets for error catastrophe. 

In contrast, the human genome is only about 10% functional (&lt;2% exons, 1% regulatory, some RNA genes, a few percent structural and spacers; stuff with documented functions adds up to a bit south of 10%). It’s possible up to 15% or so has a selected function, but given what we know about the rest, any more than that is [very unlikely]( https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2018/03/whats-in-your-genome-pie-chart.html). So the percentage of possible mutations that are harmful is far lower in the human genome compared to the viral genomes. And we have lower mutation and substitution rates. 

All of that just means we’re very unlikely to experience error catastrophe, while the viruses are the ideal candidates. And if the viruses aren’t susceptible to it, then the human genome sure as hell isn’t. 

But what of H1N1? Isn’t that a documented case of error catastrophe. That’s what Sanford claims, after all.

Except yeah wow that [H1N1 paper]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23062055) is *terrible*. Like, it’s my favorite bad paper, because they manage to get *everything* wrong. Here’s a short list of the errors the authors commit:

They ignored neutral mutations. 

They claimed H1N1 went extinct. It didn’t. Strains cycle in frequency. It’s called strain replacement.

They conflated intra- and inter-host selection, and in doing so categorize a bunch of mutations as harmful when they were probably adaptive. 

They treated codon bias as a strong indicator of fitness. It isn’t. Translational selection (i.e. selection to match host codon preferences) [doesn’t seem to do much in RNA viruses]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564115/).

They ignored host-specific constraints based on immune response, specifically how mammals use CpG dinucleotides to recognize foreign DNA/RNA and trigger an immune response. In doing so, they categorized changes in codon bias as deleterious when they were almost certainly adaptive.

They conflated virulence (how sick a virus makes you) with fitness (viral reproductive success). Not the same thing. And sometimes *inversely* correlated. 

Related, in using virulence as a proxy for fitness, they ignored the major advances in medicine from 1918 to the 2000s, *including the introduction of antibiotics*, which is kind of a big deal, since back then and still today, most serious influenza cases and deaths are due to secondary pneumonia infections. 

So no, we’ve never documented an instance of error catastrophe. Not in the lab. Not in H1N1. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P3**: “Genetic entropy” *supposedly* works like this: Mutations that are only a little bit harmful (dubbed “very slightly deleterious mutations” or VSDMs) occur, and because they are only a teensy bit bad, they cannot be selected out of the population. So they accumulate, and at some point, they build up to the point where they *are* harmful, and at that point it’s too late; everybody is burdened by the harmful mutations, has low fitness, and the population ultimately goes extinct. 

Here are all of the options for how this doesn’t work.

One, you could have a bunch of neutral mutations. Neutral because they have no effect on reproductive output. That’s what neutral means. They accumulate, but there are no fitness effects. So the population doesn’t go extinct – no error catastrophe.

Or you could have a bunch of harmful mutations. Individually, each with have a small effect on fitness. Individuals who by chance have these mutations have lower fitness, meaning these mutations experience negative selection. Maybe they are selected out of the population. Maybe they persist at low frequency. Either way, the population doesn’t go extinct, since there are always more fit individuals (who don’t have any of the bad mutations) present to outcompete those who do. So no error catastrophe. 

Or, option three, everyone experiences a bunch of mutations all at once. All in one generation, every member of a population gets slammed with a bunch of harmful mutations, and fitness declines precipitously. The average reproductive output falls below 1, and the population goes extinct. *This is also not error catastrophe*. Error catastrophe requires mutations to accumulate *over generations*. This all happened in a single generation. It’s lethal mutagenesis, a broader process in which a bunch of mutations cause death or extinction, but it *isn’t* the more specific error catastrophe. 

But we can do a better job making the creationist case for them. Here’s the strongest version of this argument that creationists can make. It’s not that the mutations are neutral, having no fitness effect, and then at some threshold become harmful, and now cause a fitness decline population-wide. It’s that they are neutral alone, but together, they experience *epistasis*, which just means that two or more mutations interact to have an effect that is different from any of them alone. 

So you can’t select out individual mutations (since they’re neutral), which accumulate in every member of the population over many generations. But subsequent mutations interact (that’s the epistasis), reducing fitness across the board. 

*But that still doesn’t work*. It just pushed back the threshold for when selection happens. Instead of having some optimal baseline that can tolerate a bunch of mutations, we have a much more fragile baseline, wherein any one of a number of mutations causes a fitness decline. 

But as soon as that happens in an individual, those mutations are selected against (because they hurt fitness due to the epistatic effects). So like above, you’d need *everyone* to get hit all in a single generation. And a one-generation fitness decline isn’t error catastrophe. 

So even the *best* version of this argument fails.

&amp;nbsp; 

**P4** and **P5**: I’m going to cover these together, since they’re pretty similar and generally work the same way. 

Basically, when you have bunch of mutations, two things operate that make error catastrophe less likely than you would expect. 

First, the distribution of fitness effects changes as mutations occur. When a deleterious mutation occurs, at least one deleterious mutation (the one that just occurred) is removed from the universe of possible deleterious mutations, and at least one *beneficial* mutation is added (the back mutation). But there are also additional beneficial mutations that may be possible now, but weren’t before, due to epistasis with that new harmful mutation. These can recover the fitness cost of that mutation, or even work together with it to recover fitness *above* the initial baseline. These types of mutations are called *compensatory mutations*, and while Sanford discusses epistasis causing harmful mutations to stack, he does not adequately weigh the effects in the other direction, as I’ve described here. 

Related, when you have a ton of mutations, you’re just more likely to find the good ones. We actually have evidence that a number of organisms have been selected to maintain higher-than-expected mutations rates, probably due to the advantage this provides. My favorite example is a ssDNA bacteriophage called phiX174. It infects *E. coli*, but lacks the “check me” sequences that its host uses to correct errors in its own genome. By artificially inserting those sequences into the phage genome, it’s mutation rate can be substantially decreased. Available evidence says that selection maintains the higher mutation rate. We also see that during mutagenic treatment, [viruses can actually become more fit]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2815918/), contrary to expectations. 

So as mutations occur, beneficial mutations become more likely, and more beneficial mutations will be found. Both processes undercut the notion of “genetic entropy”. 

&amp;nbsp;

**P6**: John Sanford is a liar. There’s really isn’t a diplomatic way to say it. He’s a dishonest hack who misrepresents ideas and data. I’ve covered this before, but I’ll do it again here, for completeness.

I’m only going to cover one particularly egregious example here, but see [here]( https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95wubb/defend_sanford/) for another I’m going to stick to the use of a distribution of mutation fitness effects from Motoo Kimura’s work, which Sanford modifies in “Genetic Entropy,” and uses to argue that beneficial mutations are too rare to undo the inevitable buildup of harmful mutations. 

Now first, Sanford claims to show a “corrected” distribution, since Kimura omitted beneficial mutations entirely from his. Except this “corrected” distribution is based on nothing. No data. No experiments. Nothing. It’s literally “I think this looks about right”. Ta-da! “Corrected”. Sure.

Second, Sanford justifies his distribution by claiming that Kimura omitted beneficial mutations because he knew they are so rare they don’t really matter anyway. He wrote:

&gt;In Kimura’s figure, he does not show any mutations to the right of zero – i.e. there are zero beneficial mutations shown. He obviously considered beneficial mutations so rare as to be outside of consideration.

Kimura’s rationale was the exact opposite of this. His distribution represents the parameters for a model demonstrating genetic drift (random changes in allele frequency). He wrote:

&gt;The situation becomes quite different if slightly advantageous mutations occur at a constant rate independent of environmental conditions. In this case, the evolutionary rate can become enormously higher in a species with a very large population size than in a species with a small population size, contrary to the observed pattern of evolution at the molecular level.

In other words, if you include beneficial mutations, they are selected for and take over the simulation, completely obscuring the role genetic drift plays. So because they occur too frequently and have too great an effect, they were omitted from consideration. 

Okay, let’s give Sanford the benefit of the doubt on the first go. Maybe, despite writing a book that leans heavily on Kimura’s work, and using one of Kimura’s figures, Sanford never actually *read* Kimura’s work, and honestly didn’t realize hat Kimura’s rationale was the exact opposite of what Sanford claims. Seems improbable, but let’s say it was an honest mistake. 

The above passage (and the broader context) were *specifically* [pointed out to Sanford[(https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/gen_entropy/), but he persisted in his claim that he was accurately representing Kimura’s work. He wrote:

&gt;Kimura himself, were he alive, would gladly attest to the fact that beneficial mutations are the rarest type

The interesting thing with that line is that it’s a slight hedge compared to the earlier statement. This indicates two things. First, that Sanford *knows* he’s wrong about Kimura’s rationale, and second, that he wants to continue to portray Kimura as agreeing with him, *even though he clearly knows better*.

DebateEvolution,9b575x,Race--Realist,,t2_v8j1d30,self.DebateEvolution,,Natural Selection is not an explanatory mechanism; it cannot explain speciation nor trait fixation,"NS is not, nor can it be as is currently formulated, a mechanism of speciation or trait fixation, as those who formulated the NS, the current Neo-Darwinian paradigm, propose:

When two traits are coextensive, how does NS distinguish the one that causes fitness from the trait that doesn’t (its linked free-rider)? It can’t because selection-for is an intensional notion.

The theory of natural selection states that organisms are selected for the relative fitness of their phenotypes in relation to their ecologies. Phenotypic traits are selected for their role in causing increases in fitness corresponding with the following principle:

If in a given ecology, organisms with T1 are more fit than organisms with T2, then, all else being equal, creatures with T1 will be selected and not creatures with T2. If both of these organisms are equally fit, then neither type of organism will be selected in preference to the other organism. But what if T1 and T2 are linked? Now suppose that T1 causes increased fitness and T2 does not. The traits are linked, so the correlation of T2 and fitness is the same as the correlation of T1 with fitness. Thus, all else being equal, if T1 is selected then so is T2. If T2 is selected then so is T1.

Darwin should have said that traits are selected which cause alterations in fitness in a given ecology, not that they’re correlated with alterations in fitness. But then Darwin would have needed to identify a mechanism that in a given ecology responds differently to phenotypic traits depending on whether or not they are causes of alterations of fitness of merely correlated with the causes of the alterations of fitness. In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of natural selection.

The theory of NS presumes a distinction between “selects” and “selects-for”, so for the theory to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2): (1) that NS has a mind/mental powers since intensionality is intentional, then intentional states have the ability to distinguish between coextensive traits; and (2) counter-factual supporting laws that phylogenetically link certain phylogenetic traits across different ecologies so that if you have one, you have the other. There is no agent of selection, (1) is discarded and there are no laws of selection so (2) is discarded so:

P1) For NS to explain the distribution of phenotypic traits it must satisfy (1) or (2).

P2) NS does not satisfy (1) or (2).

C) NS does not explain trait fixation.

Fodor's argument against NS is conceptual, thus empirical evidence is irrelevant to his argument. TNS does not explain trait fixation/speciation. At best worst, NS is false; at best, NS is a small driver of evolutionary change. But NS cannot be a mechanism since it cannot select between coextensive traits since NS is not minded (it's not an agent, it cannot intentionally choose between a fitness-enhancing trait and a linked free-rider), nor are there nomological laws that explain trait fixation. There need to be generalizeable laws, such as ""P1 phenotypes are more fit than P2 phenotypes in a given ecology"", or ""T1 causes fitness in ecology E but not T2"", or ""In ecology E, T1s are selected but not T2"" or ""Trait T in ecology E increases fitness"", or Fodor's ""All else being equal, the probability that a t1 wins a competition with a t2 in ecological situation E is p."" (What Darwin Got Wrong, pg 121) Laws of selection, meaning laws that govern the fitness of traits, need to be generalizeable across all ecologies and species; the law must determine which traits win which competitions in a given ecology.

Further touching on (1) and (2): NS needs to act on counterfactuals; but, as said in (1) and (2), it cannot act on counterfactuals because NS is not an agent (it cannot choose between two locally coextensive traits), nor are there laws of selection that are generalizable across all ecologies that explain trait fixation.

But, on the artificial selection point: Darwin was wrong to compare NS with animal breeders choosing traits: Animal breeders have minds; they can select-for and against traits (those terms are intensional); NS cannot choose between traits because it lacks a mind and there are no nomological laws that explain trait fixation.

I should touch on one more thing here: the claim from neo-Darwinists that species are ""perfectly fit"" for their ecologies on the basis of fitness-enhancing traits being selected-for their contribution to fitness in a given ecology is either a tautology or irrelevant to how traits evolve. Take this argument:

P1) Niches are individuated post hoc by reference to the phenotypes that live in said niche.

P2) If the organisms weren’t there, the niche would not be there either.

C) Therefore there is no fitness of phenotypes to lifestyles that explain said adaptation.

In lieu of a mechanism, there is no theory of ""natural selection"".

Also see Fodor's argument as articulated in What Darwin Got Wrong (pg 114):

1. *Selection-for is a causal process.*
2. ***Actual*** *causal relations aren’t sensitive to* ***counterfactual*** *states of affairs: if it* ***wasn’t*** *the case that A, then the fact that it’s being A* ***would have caused its being B*** *doesn’t explain its being the case that B.*
3. *But the distinction between traits that are selected-for and their free-riders turns on the truth (or falsity) of relevant counterfactuals.*
4. *So if T and T’ are coextensive, selection cannot distinguish the case in which T free-rides on T’ from the case that T’ free-rides on T.*
5. *So the claim that selection is the mechanism of evolution cannot be true.*",199,1535508837,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/9b575x/natural_selection_is_not_an_explanatory_mechanism/

&amp;#x200B;

# [Sarcasm]

&amp;#x200B;

In 1940, the eminent geneticist Richard Goldschmidt published the book \*The Material Basis of Evolution\*, in which he put forth the hypothesis that the gaps in the fossil record that existed then, and still exist to this day, are real, and have been breached by what he termed ""macromutations"" (large mutations), very rare but real events, generating ""hopeful monsters"". An example would be a therapod dinosaur laying eggs, from which fully-formed birds hatch.

&amp;#x200B;

All your criticisms of this hypothesis have been nothing more than **arguments from incredulity**. Are you saying that this is an *impossibility*? It is not impossible; it is only unlikely, and therefore very rare.

One aspect of genetic entropy is the realization that most mutations are very slightly deleterious, and very few mutations are beneficial. Another aspect is the realization that natural selection is confounded by features such as biological noise, haldane's dilemma and mueller's ratchet. Natural selection is unable to stop degeneration in the long run, let alone cause an upward trend of increasing integrated complexity in genomes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/99s80n/creationism_is_not_a_useful_word_it_conflates/

To this good question I can say:

&gt; What do you think the significance of that research is?

You have to look at this from the perspective of cognitive science researchers who (to fully model complex neural behaviors) have to model cellular and the molecular level processes that are at least as complicated a system to figure out as our brain and body. Cognitive scientists don't have the luxury of talking about mutation and selection, they're ultimately responsible for a working computational model ultimately showing biological development from the origin(s) of life on up to us. What gets favored in a given environment over another is something that gets watched, after it's working and time to relax and admire the new creation(s). 

The stuff of life that fills the universe may likely seed a starter molecular trial and error learning system(s) that might right now be belching out of underwater vents and/or other places. But existing living things took their niche away by changing even the atmosphere, thus they cannot reestablish themselves on beaches and other possible now gone safe incubators needed to endure past that. No matter what the starting chemistry was, you're responsible for modeling that part too, while showing ""learning rate"" and other required indicators needed to monitor performance of something either intelligent, or when learning rate is zero is not intelligent.  

Having to study ""natural selection"" related theory on top of all the theory needed for modern cognitive science is something best avoided, anyway. With all said this premise for a theory becomes true. Our not needing Darwinian variables makes all after the comma very true as well: 

&gt; The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.

Where all in ""science"" is in proper balance those who were sincere about scientific development of a new theory that somehow gives the Darwinian theory in its place (by via cognitive science being where the latest science fun's at for origins theory development) already has one, through my explaining what to look for and easiest way to begin in neuroscience related forms. No protest necessary, already done. Proves that the power of science 

Otherwise the ID controversy festers, one of the bad things to happen to anyone who break the like commandment ""science"" has in place that proclaims ""Thou shalt not take any scientifically possible theory untentatively!""

This only requires your accepting that the theory I have long been explaining in other forums makes statements like ""Neither position is based on or supported by any evidence"" not always true. Otherwise there is no example to show what Judge Jones was expecting of the Discovery Institute, where he could truthfully say that if their students could graduate from high school knowing all that it gets into like digital electronics then he would be proud too.

Science has become a whole lot easier to navigate. Even the premise of the Theory of Intelligent Design has been put into scientific context. It's so powerful that for those like you who wanted to put the DI in their place it's the same thing as already ""beating them at their own game"" strong. There's actually no greater science fun for you than that. 

To be credible I have to make no exceptions and not forget the roots of much of my work, where I want all in the heart of creationism country to be proud of. I help show what's possible, what ""creationism"" in turn becomes from it is as always up to them. In their case Kathy is state school board legend with two term happy ending that inspired something of significance to science. To these ""creationists"" it has always been disturbing to see fear of at least trying to from that one sentence premise follow the evidence to wherever it leads. In that sense the theory is from creationist thought, where instead of being a science stopper there's a science starter, that did NOT come from the Discovery Institute it's from the citizenry of the state they tried to get ""a foothold"" to from there conquer the country through. The DI's being powerless against what instead came from them is a compliment so putting the DI in their place is likewise fine by them, part of the science fun.

There needed to be something that shows where the DI was lacking and fun times like the self-assembly demonstration becoming NSTA approved then credit having to go to the most despised of them all at the time ""creationist"" in the whole world, who just happened to have been a NSTA member. Otherwise the trouble the DI was getting some into would have been there would have been around to try making sense of a such a complicated issue. It's now all state education history with hero's that has a way of locally changing how creationists feel about themselves and others that changes creationism. 

By the time Ben Stein had his movie out creationists were mostly bored by the same old and did not turn out. Many also saw it as thinly veiled Darwinian theory was like siding with the devil, not theory where Darwinian variables like ""natural selection"" are never once found, which in science is as good as it gets for showing how well the ID theory from elsewhere stands on its own merit, in a way that's good for creationism too. 

As I often have to now mention: the most scientific thing I found to do is [lighten up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIYiGA_rIls&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx) and accept that the ID controversy has has very much changed on account of progress of a scientific theory that has great signifance in many areas of science, and science education. An expected [weird story behind it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OpBylwH9DU) is also another plus, in our favor.

The Non-DI theory is now before you, and all that, where as you can see it's built on a grade school level explanation of the scientific method and other vital to understand science basics that are good to know. The rest was easily enough explained in other forums where only a few quick replies about how this works in neural models was enough said, no issue. In this forum though some things needed answering, in at least that many words. I cannot think of what might possibly be left to debate, but that's what this forum is for, so there it is.

We have recently discovered that there are communities, of microbes, called microbiomes, that thrive all around and within us. Many are familiar with our gut flora, but a microbiome has more recently been discovered that lives in the conjunctiva (mucous membranes that coat the eye's sclera and inner lining of the eyelid). We regulate that microbiome with our immune system, which of course is genetically defined, in a way that could not have arisen evolutionally. As I'm sure you would agree, it would be silly to think that we could evolve, generation by generation, over thousands of years, the ability to manage microbiomes of arrays of simple organisms that outnumber and outreproduce us by orders of magnitudes! Yet that is the case. The interactions between the human immune system and the microbiomes are astounding the experts in the field. Researchers have identified a human gene that manages the balance of immunological elements that regulate specific microbes^(1). It's as though they were *designed* to work together!

In studying the conjunctiva of mice, researchers were amazed to discover that a microbiome exists there, a place experts long thought was a sterile environment. They thought this because of the fact that the tears that wash the eyeball contain an enzyme called lysozyme, whose task it is to destroy bacteria by lysing, or chopping up, its cell wall by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds. Somehow, they don't yet know how, the microbiome's ""good"" bacteria are not affected by this lysozyme.

We know that in the gut flora, beneficial microbes compete with pathogenic microbes and keep them in check, a process called competitive exclusion. Something like this appears to be occurring in the conjunctiva's microbiome^(2). The researchers isolated a species of bacteria called *Corynebacterium mastitidis* (*C. mast*) and wondered whether it was a resident or invader of the microbiome. They tried combining *C. mast* with the conjunctiva's immune cells, and amazingly discovered that a signaling protein (cytokine) was produced! This same substance is produced by white blood cells called *lymphocytes* and *macrophages*, and is responsible for stimulating the production of other white cells, which in turn emit antimicrobial proteins into the tears. Somehow, though, the *C. mast* bacteria are not affected by the antimicrobial proteins that they signaled to be generated! Scientists ""still don't know what enables *C. mast* to successfully establish itself in the eye, whereas other similar bacteria fail to colonize.""^(3)

This is not the first, but merely the latest, example of complex interactions between a host and its microbiomes that defies evolutionary explanation.

DebateEvolution,97g5s9,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com: Arguments we think creationists should NOT use,"It's a common criticism from evolutionists that creationists don't adjust their arguments in the face of evidence. From my perspective, I'm going to say that's very true, at least for the most part. Creationists are using the same arguments for decades, and these arguments haven't changed much, despite [databases of counter arguments explaining why they're wrong.](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html)

As user u/Toaster_In_Bathtub says, it makes creationism look intellectually dishonest, when they don't seem to have any care for contradictory evidence.

From a purely methodical and logical perspective, there's only three honest things to do when presented with counter-arguments to your own arguments:

1. Accept the counter argument, and redact your claim.
2. Present a reason why the counter argument was wrong.
3. Adjust your argument in such a way that it doesn't contradict the counter argument.

Yet creationists rarely do that. They hold fast to their arguments, most of the time refusing to even address the counter arguments. On the occasions when they do address them, they'll usually dismiss them without properly dealing with them.

There is an article on Creation.com called [Arguments we think creationists should NOT use](https://creation.com/arguments-we-think-creationists-should-not-use). Creationists will, on occasion, use this article to show that creationists do redact false arguments, and thus aren't dishonest.

My opinion on this article, is it doesn't really show that at all. When reading through the list of arguments on that article, the first thing that jumps out is how safe they all are. No big arguments, no major points of content. Just little safe arguments, most of which I'd never heard from creationists before reading them in this article.

There are so many arguments they use that, at this point, are obviously wrong. Arguments that have either been refuted so thoroughly, or are based on such faulty premises, that there isn't even much ambiguity on the matter. For example:

* Mutations can't increase information. Shouldn't be used because creationists can't measure or usefully define information.

* Archeopteryx is fully bird. Obviously it has both bird and dinosaur features.

* Examples of quick burial are proof of the flood. Quick burials happen naturally, all the time.

* Irreducible complexity examples where we have potential pathways for.

There are a number of other arguments that should be redacted, but I won't list because they're more ambiguous.

So the question is, why do creationists refuse to drop arguments? I believe there are a number of reasons. First of all, creationists want to look out for other creationists. They don't want to say that other creationists are wrong. There's also the logistical nightmare of cleaning up after admitting an argument is wrong. Imagine having to remove half the articles they've published because they use arguments they've now redacted. Imagine how the authors of those articles would react. I believe most heavily religious people have issues dealing with doubt. That they have to constantly struggle to protect their beliefs from reality. And if they accept even a single argument is wrong, they may have to ask what else they're wrong about, and that could lead to a crisis of faith.

There are so many arguments, rebuttals, refutations, evidence, theories, and beliefs. I just don’t ever see anyone winning this debate when there is always something that can be said against and for both sides.


Creationists:
I mean, wouldn’t that diminish faith? (Believing in something you cannot see) ... if Creationists won this debate, would there be any need for faith when you know that the God we are praying to actually exists? That could even change the tone we have towards  God.... almost as if it would rip the innocence of our child-like hearts...


As for Evolutionists.... 
I see there have been eye-witnesses, predictions that have come true, evidence to support claims... it’s the same thing for Creationists yet we’re called crazy for believing in a “book” but Evolutionists believe in many books. 


I believe in most cases, I have seen both sides making the audience feel dumb for believing in either side... both beliefs outside of them sound absurd! Yet with passion, we make them out to be quite real.

I think this is one of the first lies the creationist community feeds to its cult and people eat it up. The only difference here is time scales.

\&gt; Earlier interpretations on genetic similarity were based on a superficial and deceptive approach. When you look at the broader picture of genetic expression and interaction, the separation between say chimpanzees and humans becomes much more evident

So is genome sequencing superficial and deceptive? 

\&gt; Since chimpanzees and human may be about 96% similar, we suggest to the evolutionist to allow the chimpanzee about 96% of our human rights. 

Although I don't know much about genetics, I'm 110% sure the claim about *96% of our human rights* grossly oversimplified and BS. Does anyone know what these ""rights"" are? 

\&gt; Fortunately, we don't call them human. We don't allocate rights on the basis of genetic expression and that distance is significantly greater than 4% when gene expression and other interactions are taken into account

Correct me if I'm wrong, but we are ""human"" due to the different *sequence* of genes, *presence* of genes, and the number of *copies of genes* we share with chimps. Also, gene expressions and interactions isn't the cause of more genetic divergence. In fact, does this have any role in causing more genetic divergence? According to [talk.origins](https://talk.origins): *Insertion and deletion (indel) events account for another approximately 3 percent difference between chimp and human sequences, but each indel typically involves multiple nucleotides. The number of genetic changes from indels is a fraction of the number of single-nucleotide substitutions (roughly 5 million compared with roughly 35 million). So describing humans and chimpanzees as 98 to 99 percent identical is entirely appropriate (Chimpanzee Sequencing 2005).* ",3,1534296937,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/97e8bh/better_response_for_this_dishonest_creationist/

DebateEvolution,96rr0g,Metamorphone,"Former YEC, Geology student",,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation.com on out of order fossils,"I wanted to make this post as a clear example to everyone on how far off the mark these creationist articles are. Here's the link I'll be using, this one regarding so called ""out of order"" fossils: https://creation.com/fossils-out-of-order

The authors of the article make several claims, but the gist is that fossils they think are equivalent to Precambrian rabbits are abundant. They also link to work done by Carl Werner, which will be discussed below. But lets get into this. 

Their fist issue is that they think the conventional chronology is too plastic. For example, if we find evidence of some plant fossil in rocks 100 million years earlier than we thought they existed, we'll just adjust the chronology because the fossil record isn't perfect. They then claim that any fossil, no matter how out of place, can theoretically be incorporated and not falsify evolution. 

This isn't really the case. Fossil range extensions are indeed a valid thing, but what creationists don't get is that there are limits. For example, if you found the fossil of a flowering plant from the Cenozoic in the Silurian, that can't be a range extension; as the most primitive members identified as plants have not shown up, so no method of evolution can be incorporated to explain this. Likewise, if we find a dinosaur fossil before even the most primitive reptiles, that cannot be a range extension for the same reasons. They don't mention this limit that paleontologists work with, and instead straw man what they actually do. Not shocking. 

Next up they start making arguments about evolution's ability to predict fossils, and why it ""falls dramatically short."" These include statements Darwin made about fossilization, the stasis of fossil jellyfish, fossilized ink sacs, and the burial of an ichthyosaur giving birth. But do any of these actually mean much? No. While Darwin himself did say that ""no organism wholly soft can be preserved,"" the change of life over geologic time has nothing to do with mechanisms of fossilization. Evolution does not predict, contrary to the author's assertion, that soft body fossils cannot be found. That doesn't even make sense, given all we know about things like Lagerstätten deposits. 

Fossilized Jellyfish do show pretty good morphological similarity, but that doesn't really tell us a lot. Many jellyfish alive today show even more closeness to each other, yet still have different behavioral patterns, biochemistry, etc. The problem is fossilization only preserves morphology and not any of these other features, so we can't just say they're exactly the same. As for the fossilized ink, there are [good reasons](http://reasons.org/explore/publications/nrtb-e-zine/read/nrtb-e-zine/2012/08/01/do-fossilized-ink-sacs-discolor-the-case-for-an-old-earth) why it could survive so long. It also wasn't fresh ink they could just dab and write with. It was solidified and only became a sort of ""paint"" (not ink) when mixed with an ammonia solution. Hardly fresh. The ichthyosaur isn't shocking either. Geologists have known since the mid 1900's about turbidite deposits, basically underwater landslides that accompany earthquakes. These not only explain singular examples but also [ichthyosaur graveyards.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262603758_A_Lower_Cretaceous_ichthyosaur_graveyard_in_deep_marine_slope_channe_ldeposits_at_Torres_del_Paine_National_Park_Southern_Chile) This phenomenon is well known, and runs contrary to the authors hint that geologists will still claim these were buried slowly. 

Some other examples they throw up: 

&gt;Trilobites, which are allegedly 500 myo in the Cambrian strata, have eyes that are far too complex for their place in the fossil record. That is, they have no precursors to their appearance.

[We actually have a lot of information on trilobite precursors](http://www.trilobites.info/origins.htm)

&gt;Perhaps most astonishingly, pollen fossils—evidence of flowering plants—were found in the Precambrian strata. According to evolutionists, flowering plants first evolved 160 mya, but the Precambrian strata is older than 550 mya.

If they're referring to creationist work on this, [creationists themselves falsified it.](https://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/burdick_polen_kh.htm) If its to the ""Roraima Pollen Paradox"" claim, [thats also wrong,](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/responding-to-flood-geology/roraima) and was never replicated in future studies. 

&gt;Dinosaurs are supposed to have evolved into birds. But Confuciusornis was a true beaked bird that pre-dates the ‘feathered’ dinosaurs that it allegedly came from. It also has been found in the stomach of a dinosaur.

The authors don't recognize that evolution branches, it isn't linear. Birds evolved from dinosaurs, and *are* dinosaurs, but a Velociraptor didn't become a Macaw. 

&gt;A dog-like mammal fossil was found with remains of dinosaurs in its stomach—but no mammals large enough to prey on dinosaurs were supposed to exist alongside them.

The mammal was actually the size of a large cat, so not very big, and the dinosaur was only 5 five inches long. It was a relatively small mammal and an even smaller dinosaur. They completely misrepresented the animal's scales, and what it meant. 

&gt;A mammal hair was found in amber supposed 100 million years old. Once again, this is smack in the middle of the alleged ‘age of dinosaurs’ when no such mammals existed.

Conventional wisdom places the first mammals around 210 million years ago. We knew they existed around this time. The authors are just wrong. 

&gt;Living fossils, and Carl Werner 

[Oh boy..](http://dogmadebate.blogspot.com/2013/07/what-is-all-this-fuss-over-living.html). Werner is a joke. He speaks in extremely vague  terms and has literally said ""Some physicians in the past have helped other fields. Therefore even a Physicians uneducated opinion is on par with a trained expert."" That's just...wow. Just wow. 

&gt;Tiktaalik is predated by other footprints 

Irrelevant. Tiktaalik's position, and geologic environment, was predicted by evolution and paleontology. Not possible if Flood Geology was true. The footprints themselves aren't even fully established. There's a range of options and later reasearch...all of which YEC authors never report. [Even Wikipedia lists them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik)

&gt;Cambrian explosion 

And another [PRATT.](https://biologos.org/common-questions/scientific-evidence/cambrian-explosion) 

They close with this: 

&gt;In fact, the more fossils we find, the more random the picture becomes. 

Sure, when you leave out relevant data and ignore further research you can get that impression. But it's just not true though. Not when we look at the actual data and research done. 

This article is just a classic example of why I will *never* give YEC authors the benefit of the doubt. They constantly strawman the actual evolutionary position, malign and misrepresent data, and never bother to check their own work. With this being the case, it's frankly stupid to expect anyone to just try and have a kind, gentle dialogue with them, and throw away counterarguments because ""well, maybe they did consider that, you dunno..."" Until their original arguments are accurate with the data and give fair representations of their opponents position, they deserve exposure, not the benefit of the doubt.

I figured this might save people some time instead of having to type it out themselves. I'll try to keep it brief. 

So creationists generally have three main sorting mechanisms for Flood geology that they like to use to explain fossils, and occasionally a fourth. These are Hydrologic Sorting, Ecological Zonation, Differential Escape, and TABs. I'll elaborate on them and their problems below. I'm pulling the definitions from here: https://creation.com/order-in-the-fossil-record

Hydrologic Sorting is the notion that ""the smaller, denser, and more spheroid organisms are, the quicker they will settle out of the Floodwaters into sediments."" Now this does make sense, it would happen in a Flood scenario I'm sure. But it doesn't explain most of the fossils we see. For example, when we look 

Differential escape is where ""the smarter, more endothermic, and greater mobility an organism has, the higher in the fossil record it will tend to be."" I'm not sure why they associate how endothermic something is with speed, surely things like velociraptors could outrun many warm blooded mammals. That aside this doesn't explain much at all. For instance, how did whales manage to outrun the floodwaters? Moreover how could whales outrun dinosaurs? Or likewise, why are birds and pterodactyls not found together? The list goes on. 

Ecological Zonation means ""that different life-forms in different strata reflect the serial destruction, transport and burial of ecological life-zones during the Flood."" [Here's a model of it.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wrXgOqe-sYQ/Un0ioHP98qI/AAAAAAAAAE8/y59F9XNEFzg/s1600/2136019258_e746f3a830_z.jpg) So you'd start by burying bottom dwelling sea creatures, then shore dwelling sea life and animals near the shore, then further inland and higher elevations the reptiles and dinosaurs, then higher up to the mammals and so on. The problems here are numerous. We should under this model expect to find deep sea reptiles, such as plesiosaurs, ichtyosaurs, and sea turtles buried much lower in the Flood sediments than land reptiles and amphibians such as Eryops, Lagosuchus or Herrerasaurus. Instead, we find the marine reptiles consistently higher in the column than these land animals. We should find whales and marine reptiles together, as they shared a similar environment, as we would with many fishes throughout the rock record. But we don't. And these are worldwide patterns so they can't be caused by geographical isolation, as if they were transported worldwide, ecological zones would not be preserved due to the violent waters transporting them across a planet. 

Finally we have the TAB mechanism. TAB standing for Tectonically Associate Bioprovidences. Basically a TAB consists of multiple ecologic zones sitting on a chunk of a tectonic plate, and each plate has a certain tendency for sinking relative to each other. So TABs containing Cambrain-Ordivician Fauna were always on plates that were likely to sink first, followed by others ones, and so on. Oh boy, where to begin...well for starters, this doesn't make much sense. There's no logical reason why plates with trilobites would ALWAYS have to be the ones to sink before the dinosaurs. It's literally explained with ""God just wanted those animals to sink first."" Like, that's it. Scientific AF, I know. But furthermore, this model is just...God it's *terribly* flawed. Geologist Kevin Henke lists the numerous issues with it [here.](http://blog.theleagueofreason.co.uk/reason/kevin-henke-tackles-john-woodmorappes-tab-flood-sorting-mechanism/) Tl;dr, Woodmorappe couldn't even get basic fossil orders right and made contradictory maps and charts when trying to make this model. He doesn't know what makes a good index fossil so his analysis is even worse off. He ignores the use of fossil assemblages. He provides no real evidence for his model, only presenting the fact that there's slightly more tectonically altered sediments lower down but ignoring the effects of erosion in this pattern AND ignoring that the ""lower segment"" he maps out is over 150 million years longer than the upper portion, so that's not unexpected. He was challenged to apply this to a real basin but never did. On and on and on. I can see why places like AiG and ICR never recognize this mechanism and why it never caught on. If you do a literature trail of their journals it didn't seem to impress anyone or make much headway, probably because how ad-hoc it is yet how little it realistically explains. Until something more credible is brought forward I suggest just discounting this entirely. It's so garbage and so rarely referenced it isn't worth the energy. 

Now a lot of the times creationists will say that these criticisms mean nothing because they deal with things individually, not combined. This isn't true. Lets take the example of marine reptiles and whales. They're completely separated in the fossil record, despite having shared similar environments. This is something neither ecological zonation, hydrologic sorting, or differential escape would produce; after all neither could flee to higher ground, they lived in the same environments, and they had a wide range in body size and shape. No matter how you combine these factors you aren't going to somehow get them to segregate. It just doesn't add up. This goes for many other fossil assemblages as well. 

Hope this is useful to someone. This is hardly an exhaustive list of the problems with these mechanisms. ",17,1533874154,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/963ofv/regarding_flood_sorting_mechanisms/

When the aliens think, that enough animals have been fossilized, and enough species went extinct (gradually, 90% of all species from the start of the intervention), they top with the mind control, they stop intervening.

DebateEvolution,95wubb,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,Defend Sanford.,"I would like to for someone to defend John Sanford.

For those who aren't familiar, Sanford is a geneticist and young earth creationist. His creationist claim to fame is the concept of ""genetic entropy,"" which biologists call ""error catastrophe."" 

He wrote a book on this, aptly titled ""Genetic Entropy,"" and it's bad. Really bad. 

The science is bad enough, and you can read about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7sbiop/more_experimental_refutation_of_this_genetic/) if you are so inclined. 

But I want to look at Sanford's *conduct*, specifically the possibility that he is either extremely dishonest or woefully uninformed regarding the topics in his book. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, let's look at how Sanford misuses a figure by [Motoo Kimura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoo_Kimura). Kimura's contribution to evolutionary biology is [neutral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution) (and really, his should be a household name like Haldane or Gould). 

Sanford uses a figure from Kimura's work that shows the distribution of fitness effects of mutations, slightly modified. [Here is Sanford's figure](https://letterstocreationists.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kimura-diagram_w-benef.jpg?w=960&amp;h=731). 

As you can see, there are *almost* no beneficial mutations shown here. In Kimura's original version, there were literally no beneficial mutations, because he purposely omitted them. In his own words:

&gt;In this formulation, we disregard beneficial mutations, and restrict our consideration only to deleterious and neutral mutations.

This is because Kimura's work was on *neutral* evolution. He's making a point by not showing things that will be selected for. He's *not* saying such mutations don't happen. Just ""we're not going to show them here, because I want to focus on this other set of mutations.""

But about this figure, Sanford says:

&gt;In Kimura’s figure, he does not show any mutations to the right of zero – i.e. there are zero beneficial mutations shown. He obviously considered beneficial mutations so rare as to be outside of consideration.

There is no way to give an honest reading of Kimura's work and arrive at that conclusion. 

So we're left with the question of whether Sanford is misrepresenting Kimura's work, or hasn't read it, despite basing so much of his own work on this single distribution. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, let's look at some of the only actual data Sanford presents: The supposed extinction of H1N1 due to ""genetic entropy."" He has [a whole paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/) on this, and [I love how terrible it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7uldw6/rcreation_is_now_butthurt_that_the_747_junkyard/dtl6qzd/).

He makes the same argument in his book, but uses an additional figure: A graph showing the decline in H1N1 fitness during the 20th century. It's super simple: the y-axis is fitness, the x-axis is time. Easy. 

Except...you knew there was going to be an except...the original figure, from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9652423) ([pdf](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.327.2581&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)) doesn't show ""fitness"" on the y-axis, or even ""pathogenicity,"" which Sanford incorrectly conflates with fitness. It's ""%Excess P&amp;I Deaths Among Persons &lt;65 Years of Age."" In other words, it's the fraction of flu-attributed deaths among people less than 65 years old. 

Considering how specific a reference this is, and that Sanford went through the trouble of reproducing that figure, but changing the axis label, one has to wonder. Does he not realize there's a difference, or is he dishonestly manipulating the data? 

&amp;nbsp;

So, would anyone like to defend Sanford? And I mean specifically defend his use of Kimura's distribution and/or these influenza data. I don't care that he's a world-renowned geneticist. I don't care that he invented the gene gun. I don't care that he something something Smithsonian. I don't care how nice/humble/generous/whatever her is. I'm sure he's lovely. Don't. Care. Defend his conduct in these specific instances, if you can. ",56,1533824513,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95wubb/defend_sanford/
DebateEvolution,95qgr8,apophis-pegasus,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Would this be a sound arguement for evolution?,"I used this in a discussion over at r/Creation 



We know animals, even animals of the same species have individual differences.

We know that not all animals survive to reproduce in nature (or even in captivity).

We know that the ones that do tend to have some trait/s that helped them survive (ran a little faster, his a little better, etc)

We know that these traits are caused or influenced by hereditary- traits that can be passed down to offspring.

Therefore, groups of organisms (species, Clans, etc) will eventually change to have more advantageous traits than not over successive generations. These changes can be anything that has a hereditary base. Enough changes can even create drastically different looking and acting organisms than the ones before e.g. dogs, corn, etc.

Now:

We know shared genes means relatedness. The more genes you share, the more closely related you are. Thats how ancestry tests work, and paternity tests.

We know being related to someone means you share a common ancestor. You are related to your sibling by your parents, your parents by grandparents, etc. This works in every organism we see.

So with that in mind if you genetically test two different organisms and have them related to some degree e.g. a monkey and a cat, it will overwhelmingly mean they shared a common ancestor (as it has before), and we do know that over time a group of organisms can change over time in certain ways due to its environment, even in different ways to another group of organisms of the same species.

Ergo, it stands to reason, the monkey and cat had an ancestor species that changed in two different ways due to two different environments over enough generations to form a cat and a monkey.",3,1533765162,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95qgr8/would_this_be_a_sound_arguement_for_evolution/

OP /u/PaulPriceCMI visits the sub to introduce the following topic:

&gt; It seems the online world suffers badly from the 'Echo Chamber' effect, where people generally are only exposing themselves to sources of information that feed them what they expect and want to hear (self-insulation). **Particularly difficult for creationists is getting any evolutionists, or old earthers for that matter, to be willing to actually read what the other side is saying and deal with the evidence.** Does anyone have thoughts on ways to overcome this?

The thread sparked a discussion on what the difference is between educating the masses vs convincing scientists (and is still ongoing).

Most interesting snippet (imo) is shown below, I recommend reading the whole thread.

&amp;nbsp;

___

A:

&gt; I think you should start by convincing scientists. If you can convince biologists that evolution is not the best explanation for the evidence, the public would follow.

&gt; **This will be difficult because evolution *is* the best explanation.** If creationists are right, though, that would be the best way to convince the world.

OP:

&gt; That's a very elitist attitude, isn't it? Actually convincing the public is of infinite value since people are making spiritual decisions that effect eternity, not just their temporal lives, based on wrong ideas about origins being pushed by establishment sources. **The fact is that that 'big science' is never likely to admit they were wrong and creationists were right.**

A:

&gt; From a certain perspective, I suppose it might be. **If you can't convince experts in the field that you're right, however, why should the public be convinced?** In all cases that I can think of, public opinion follows expert opinion.

OP:

&gt; Well simply because **the truth is not dependent on the consensus of so-called 'experts'**, which is subject to change for many reasons having little or nothing to do with the strength of evidence. **The reasons people choose to believe what they do often have more to do with personal reasons and groupthink than they do the actual evidence.**

A:

&gt; That's fair, but there's no similar ideology driving acceptance of the theory of evolution, at least not to the same extent. Rather, it seems to me that **creationism is much more likely to be ideology-driven, with the proponents having strong religious reasons to find a certain conclusion.**

OP:

&gt; Evolution is a great example of groupthink in action. The majority of scientists don't actually work on evolution directly, but they **take it on faith because they're told it's the consensus view** and they don't feel qualified to challenge it. **There is more than sufficient evidence now to convince the scientists, but it is not doing so because they are not open to changing their minds.**",130,1533752343,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/95ojv5/echo_chamber_rcreation_has_a_discussion_about/
DebateEvolution,95jjvm,No-Karma-II,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Spontaneous origin of life, a necessary component of a naturalistic evolutionary synthesis, is unscientific.","[This](https://imgur.com/a/nhk3Vp1) is a page from one of the most popular college-level general biology books. It states that, regarding the origin of life, there are three popular explanations:

* Special Creation
* Extraterrestrial Origin
* Spontaneous Origin

Of these three, the authors claim that only the third, Spontaneous Origin, is ""*scientific*""--that is, it is the only one that can be tested and potentially disproved.

So far, it has never been tested, at least not successfully. Pasteur's **Law of Biogenesis** still rules the day. Life *always* springs from life. Not only have we not observed life spring into being spontaneously, we have not succeeded in creating life from lifeless chemicals at all, even by applying our best intelligent design to the task.

So, at this time, Spontaneous Origin fails the requirement of testability.

If you are a reader that agrees with the authors, could you offer a test for falsifiability?

I claim that Spontaneous Origin is wholly and patently unscientific.

DebateEvolution,947dk9,eternaldarkness22,,,self.DebateEvolution,,A debate about mutations,"I originally posted this in r/DebateAnAtheist, but they told me to post it here better, so here we go. 

 First, i hope i can have a decent debate without pointless downvotes or being made fun of or people responding before reading my whole post, thanks.

So i want to have a debate about evolution and mutations in particular. What triggers mutations ? Most people say they're random, but in evolution they're shown to never be random AT ALL.

For example, we have in these sources ( Robin J. Wotton, "" The Mechanical De-sign of insect Wings"", Scientific American, v.263, November 1990, p.120) .... (Pierre-Paul Grassé, Evolution of Living Or-ganisms, New York, Academic Press, 1977, p30). That dinosaurs evolved their wings by trying to catch flies and after a certain period, a mutation occurred and they evolved their wings to be able to survive.

Another examples is how Giraffes evolved their long necks to be able to reach tall trees and eat in order to survive.

Another example is the beetles of Madeira Island. Because they live in a stormy island, air always pushes their wings and throw them in the sea, when a mutation makes it without wings, it’s chance of survival is better.

Do you notice the common thing here ? Mutations happened for a REASON. In the first example they evolved their wings to be able to catch flies and survive, in the second their evolved their necks to be able to reach high trees and survive, in the third they completely deactivated some genes to be able to survive. That's completely against how mutations are random. It seems to me like it's a Japanese anime or something, when the protagonist face a problem, he tries to change the impossible through his willpower and summon the hidden powers inside him, which is laughable. Mutations are extremely rare, like 1 in 10 thousands. Also 99% of mutations without a doubt are harmful and destroying, like Cancer, Anemia, Alzheimer, diabetes, some other stuff like Progeria which makes kids’ faces like old men, dawn syndrome, people like the elephant man, Mediterranean fever, dwarfism, albinism and lots of other really bad diseases and syndromes. Mutations are mostly errors, just random errors. It happens during the natural processing of DNA copying, but the errors have very low chances to actually happen, because there’s a mechanism in the genes that fixes the errors that happen. There’s about 1 million error and 1 million fix in just 1 day. And despite that mechanism, some errors still happen sometimes. These are mutations, they’re harmful, disfiguring, destroying, weak. And they mess with the DNA to change what they change.

The genetic information which are being copied in the DNA are like the lines that are written by a typewriter over and over, the mutation is a typographical error happens during the copying process and result in distorted lines, they say that these distorted lines are the reason of all beauty in the world and nature nowadays. But disfigurement can’t explain anything, except one thing, DEATH.

So in order for a good mutation that helps any species to overcome a certain situation in the perfect time, is IMPOSSIBLE. We're talking here about a 0.0000001% chance or something. You can't take this mechanism and prove evolution with it because it's extremely unlikely to happen.

Actually it's impossible in most cases because mutations CAN'T add new info to the DNA, they can only mess with what's already exist. I know you'll say that duplication and copying of genetics can occur, but it's still isn't going to explain anything.

If i have a gene X with Y number of info and it was copied and now i have another gene x with y number of info. The same number of same info has increased, but there's no new DIFFERENT info added at all. and if it was duplicated and became XX, it'd a new gene with more of the same info, so nothing special. The same mutation that could have occurred in the original gene would occur in the copied or duplicated one and the same result would happen. I can have one of my genes duplicated and then mutated and i'll still not grow something new because mutations can't add anything new as it's not a magical wand. LUCA had 345 gene and humans have 20 thousands genes. No matter how many of LUCA's or any other species' genes duplicated or copied and then mutated, they'll never turn to be another species as the info and genes in different gene pools are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Mutations can't change this fact, you can't add what you don't have and you can't have info out of nowhere.

If you give me a wooden box, i can reform it in another form, but it'll still contain the same amount of wood, but i can't suddenly summon my magic wand and then abra kadabra the box to be painted in red without actually adding anything by myself.

tl;dr : Mutations are extremely rare, random and harmful in most cases, so in order for them to actually be responsible for the beauty we witness everyday in life, the chance would be too small that it's mathematically impossible.

P.S : There's another stupid theory here [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160629-giraffes-did-not-evolve-long-necks-to-reach-tall-trees](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160629-giraffes-did-not-evolve-long-necks-to-reach-tall-trees) that giraffes evolved long necks with stretching them, which is extremely stupid of course as you can't pass the info in your Somatic cells to your offspring, only the ones in your germ cells.

Example : You can't pass down the muscles you earned in the gym to you kid because the info are in the somatic cells, not germ ones.",98,1533279360,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/947dk9/a_debate_about_mutations/
DebateEvolution,940ko9,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity “Research Paper” #6: “Climbing the Steiner Tree—Sources of Active Information in a Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Euclidean Steiner Tree Problem ”, in which Dembski complains about a genetic algorithm.","So here we go, “paper” #6 from BIO-Complexity ([pdf](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2012.1/BIO-C.2012.1)).

This paper is all about a genetic algorithm used to solve for a Steiner Tree. A bit of background before we get into it: A Steiner tree is a network of lines and nodes where they meet (interchanges in this paper) connecting pre-specified coordinate points via the shortest possible path. Back in 2006, the authors over at The Panda’s Thumb [issued a challenge](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/08/design-challeng-1.html) (read that, you’ll see some names familiar to r/debateevolution) that involved Steiner trees: Solve the problem with an algorithm, and also have people do math to solve it, then have creationists identify which answers where which. 

Of course, none of them could tell the designed (i.e. solved by people) solutions from the evolved (i.e. generated by the algorithm), so they (Dembski specifically) responding by arguing that the information to solve the problem was “front-loaded” into the algorithm. 

&amp;nbsp;

This charge takes two forms. The first is that the answer is specifically and explicitly present in the code. This was absurd on its face, so they fell back to the second form of the argument, that the structure of the code itself dictates that a specific results *must* occur. So even if the solution isn’t explicitly stated in the code, it is still “designed” when it is generated due to the programmer designing the code in such a way that a specific outcome is predetermined. 

This paper is an attempt to elaborate on that second form of the objection, specifically with regard to Dave Thomas’ algorithm (Thomas is the author of the Panda’s Thumb piece linked above).  

So let’s get into it. 

&amp;nbsp;

The specific challenge issued to Dembski et al. is to identify the specific part of code that provides the solution. In other words, specifically identify the “front-loading”. The authors identify two specific pieces. 

The first ensures that there are at least two interchanges in the network connecting the points. The second specifies that no mutations cause tne number of interchanges to go below two. 

The claim is that these two pieces of the code contain all of the information necessary to solve the problem. 

But that’s wrong, and the data *in this paper* show that that’s wrong, because they generate lots of different potential solutions, some better and many worse than others. 

All that these two components of the algorithm do is establish fitness parameters in addition to the overall “shorter path is more fit” selective pressure. It also contains the parameter that 1 or fewer interchanges is extremely low fitness. So you never see those potential solutions. *That’s it*. Really. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is a bunch of stuff in there about recombination, but it isn’t relevant. The purpose was to identify the parts of the code in which the solution to the problem is front-loaded. The two pieces identified as such do nothing of the sort, and the data generated *by the authors* show as much, in that they generate not one optimal solution, but many solutions of varying fitness. 

So this is a huge swing and a miss for the creationists. And you have to laugh, because it’s a response to a blog post from *six years earlier*, and in all that time, the creationists arguments didn’t improve at all. 

Which is about par for the course. ",4,1533225913,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/940ko9/biocomplexity_research_paper_6_climbing_the/

It's all absolute nonsense of course.

If you're a young earth Creationist Christian and someone said to you, ""Well, I would NEVER be a Christian because of all those Romans that Jesus murdered."" Your first and very correct instinct would be to say ""What are you TALKING about!?!?"" Jesus never murdered Romans and anyone who says he did is betraying a deep illiteracy of Christianity. You wouldn't stand for that. It's inane. It's untrue and you shouldn't have to devote any time or effort ""defending"" this claim. And yet folks who understand Biology spend so much of their time explaining the basics against claims that effectively amount to the equivalent of ""Jesus murders romans"". 

Topic for debate: the anti-evolution crowd wouldn't be the anti-evolution crowd if they understand evolution properly. This isn't meant as a pejorative or to antagonize. Please don't take it as such. It's meant as identifying an issue that needs to be discussed and (ideally) remedied. ",37,1532697575,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/92cg27/scientific_illiteracy/

This led to one of the most hostile evolution arguments I've ever had, not with a Creationist but with a fairly large ""pro-science"" account.

While I thought I had clearly articulated my argument and I tried multiple times to clarify my point and to resolve the disagreement this account just resorted to re-state the original claim again and again, called me ""ignorant"", a ""moron"", and a ""piece of shyte"" before finally blocking me. 

The closest to an ""argument"" I got from this person was that  WE SHARE AN ""APE-LIKE"" COMMON ANCESTOR"" with monkeys and that ""MONKEYS ARE A MODERN SPECIES - THEY DID NOT EVEN FUCKING EXIST WHEN OUR ANCESTORS SPLIT"". Both claims are clearly wrong.

Two things first:

* Since this is supposed to be a biology related subreddit, I want this discussion to be about evidence for creationism, **not** a discussion about religion. Please leave those to a minimum, thank you.

* This question was posed and discussed here several times beforehand, here are the relevant threads. Basically, the question on what we would count as evidence for creation directly correlates with evidence we already have on creationism (None). If there is none, the evidence that would count isn't there. Or not here *yet*.

DebateEvolution,8zmi88,DarwinZDF42,evolution is my jam,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity ""research article"" #5: ""A Stylus-Generated Artificial Genome with Analogy to Minimal Bacterial Genomes."" This is not in any sense a research paper.","We're back with the fifth of BIO-Complexity's so-called ""research papers,"" and this one...isn't. 

It's ""A Stylus-Generated Arti cial Genome with Analogy to Minimal Bacterial Genomes"" ([pdf](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.3/BIO-C.2011.3)).

All this is is a description of how the authors used a progam called Stylus to create an artificial genome. That's it. They argue in the (very short) discussion that this has implications for evolutionary biology because in encoding a short bit of text in the artificial genome and genetic code, they demonstrate the complexity of a minimal genome. 

That's it. ""We built a thing."" Great. But this isn't, in any sense, ""research"". There's no question being asked, no hypothesis being tested, no data analysis. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do want to hone in on one paragraph in the discussion, because it gets in to *other questions*, questions that are not the topic of this paper, but interesting questions nonetheless. Here is that paragraph (bottom left of page 12):

&gt;Whatever the origin
of these low-level processes of genetic causation may have been,
their physical operation today depends only on the molecular
systems now implementing them. This of course makes the
study of molecular biology as we now see it entirely legitimate
and feasible as a discipline in itself, wholly uncoupled from
questions of origins. But the reverse is not at all true. Evolutionary
causation is intrinsically tied to the relationship between
genotype and phenotype, which depends on low-level genetic
causation. It follows that evolutionary explanations of the origin
of functional protein systems must subordinate themselves
to our understanding of how those systems operate. In other
words, the study of evolutionary causation cannot enjoy the
disciplinary autonomy that studies of genetic causation can.

Basically, the authors here argue that we can't separate evolutionary explanations from how *extant* genetic systems operate, implying that this is the case *even if they operated differently in the past*. Which is a bit of a problem: Some well-supported evolutionary explanations involve systems that are either no longer present in extant life or are much less prevalent than thought to be in the past. Replication via ribozymes, for example. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that's all I have to say about this one, which isn't much. Because there just isn't much here.

The first is: ""How can we trust dating methods if we know they are not 100% accurate?"" I told him that there was a certain margin of error in dating methods, and he pounced on this and said that if we can't know with absolute certainty how old something is exactly, then we can't trust it at all. I then responded that I would rather believe something and be wrong by a 1% error than to be wrong by 99%, and he simply said that it doesn't matter because I'm still wrong either way.

The second is: ""How can dating methods tell us how old the Earth is if it was formed gradually?"" If the Earth was formed by accretion, bombardment from asteroids, etc. how can someone say it was 4.5 billion years old if that process took so much time in itself?

The third is: ""Who was the first human?""

I asked him why it was such a big problem if we can't say exactly who the first human was and he said that if we don't know how humans got here, then the whole ""theory"" falls apart.

**[Original article titled ""Cross species transfer of genes has driven evolution""](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-species-genes-driven-evolution.html)**


___

TL;DR of the article:



&gt; Far from just being the product of our parents, University of Adelaide scientists have shown that widespread transfer of genes between species has radically changed the genomes of today's mammals, and been an important driver of evolution.

&gt; In the world's largest study of so-called ""jumping genes"", the researchers have traced two particular jumping genes across 759 species of plants, animals and fungi. These jumping genes are actually small pieces of DNA that can copy themselves throughout a genome and are known as transposable elements.

&gt; They have found that cross-species transfers, even between plants and animals, have occurred frequently throughout evolution.

&gt; ""Jumping genes, properly called retrotransposons, copy and paste themselves around genomes, and in genomes of other species. How they do this is not yet known although insects like ticks or mosquitoes or possibly viruses may be involved—it's still a big puzzle,"" says project leader Professor David Adelson, Director of the University of Adelaide's Bioinformatics Hub.

&gt; ""This process is called horizontal transfer, differing from the normal parent-offspring transfer, and it's had an enormous impact on mammalian evolution.""


That is from the article. Will there be *actual* criticism of the article, the paper or the findings? No. Will there be trashy claims with no real substance behind it? You bet:

___


&gt; Having proven common descent totally untenable, let us now consider Darwin's original theory that we did not actually descend from a common ancestor, but that we have been sharing genes with our cousins.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In any other ""science"" a discovery with this much widespread effect would demand the entire rewrite of our understanding of that field. Cosmologist go back to the drawing board for far less. Only in evolutionary biology do the facts never call for a rethink of the status quo just so stories.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Fascinating. A discovery which should falsify the idea of common descent is considered to have ""driven evolution."" Just another example of the many-headed hydra that is evolutionary theory.

When asked ""How should gene transfer ""falsify"" common descent?"" The answer by /u/nomenmeum is:

&gt; **It is the presence of genes that cannot be accounted for by common descent that falsifies the idea of common descent. Gene transfer is the ad hoc attempt to save the idea.**

Agree or disagree with that last statement of /u/nomenmeum? I feel like he has talked about horizontal gene transfer in this sub already but I might be wrong.

Anyways I'm sadly off to work but I absolutely *had* to post this beforehand because I already sensed from the beginning that the thread will be most likely filled with claims and a circlejerk rather than criticisms of substance. And behold it is already becoming true.

Questions like ""how did insect camoflage come to be?"" Or ""how did consciousness emerge?"" are always answered with conjecture and *what may have happened* scenarios none of which can be tested or observed in real time.

I hate to argue on the side of the creationists. But I think if everything was created, they could easily have been created with these bone structures.

Now there is one form of this argument that I may find convincing. If it can be shown that a species would be better off with a certain bone structure, but instead has the common one, you could then say that if they were created, the species would likely have the more perfect bone structure, but if they evolved, than the bone structure would have passed on. However, I have never seen this. (I'm just using bone structure as an example,  I'm aware the argument applies to other things.)

A Mosquito even breeds at a much much higher clip than mammals do, not to mention they tend to pick up and transport a lot of blood from various organisms, increasing the potential for horizontal gene transfer from other species. 

And before you say that mosquitoes, for some reason, didn't ""need"" to evolve, what about all the gazillions of neutral mutations that should've occurred over the past 100+ million years?  Those mutations, since they evade selection, would change mosquitoes at least somewhat over time, even if only by neutral traits.   And why is it that so many organisms never seemed to evolve from anything else or to anything else.

I have blueprints for a robot, these blueprints are drawn out on a page on my desk. I will follow these blueprints to build this robot, the robot then, once it is built, will build another robot.

&gt;they claimed that there was no inheritance of acquired characteristics- wrong.

This is the common misunderstanding of genomic imprinting via epigenetic mechanisms as Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits. But that's not how it works. 

Lamarck was ""Parent acquires trait A, offspring has trait A.""

Imprinting is ""Conditions for parent lead to offspring having trait A."" So for example, embryonic development in a low-calorie environment can possibly contribute to more efficient lipid synthesis. But the parents don't adapt to low calories by having more efficient lipid synthesis and then pass that trait to their offspring. The offspring have different gene expression patterns due to earlier conditions. 

They're not the same thing at all. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed that there was no breaking of Weismann’s barrier - wrong.

I'm an evolutionary biologist and I had to look up what this is. It's from 1892 and involves concepts like ""germ plasma"". That explains why I'd never heard of it. Since the late 1880s, we've learned quite a bit. Like horizontal gene transfer. Surprise? Apparently. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They denied that adaptive mutations can be triggered by the environment - wrong.

No, that's actually correct. Adaptive mutations, specifically adaptive mutations, are not triggered by the environment. Some organisms have mechanisms that increase the rate of mutation or recombination in response to environmental stress, but they can't pick just the adaptive mutations. They just have more of them, so they're more likely to find an adaptive mutation. 


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They denied genes/traits can jump species laterally - wrong.

Transformation was first demonstrated by Frederick Griffith in 1928. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said all adaptive changes in nature happen by random mutation plus selection - wrong.

Plus recombination and gene flow, and regulatory changes if you're only counting changes within coding sequences in the original statement. And sometimes you don't need selection; a trait will persist due to drift and become beneficial later on. That's probably the most recent addition to this suite of mechanisms, and that's from the 60s.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed 98 percent of the genome was junk - wrong.

And this was when? 98% of the genome is non-coding. It's not a secret nor a surprise that a bunch of the non-coding stuff is functional. Jacob and Monod did their Lac operon stuff in the late 50s and early 60s, so by the time we got to sequencing the human genome, non-coding regulatory sequences were well documented. It's 85-90% nonfunctional, most of which is repetitive sequences derived from mobile genetic elements. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They claimed that genes were selfish - wrong.

Kin selection, which has been demonstrated (my favorite example is ground squirrel alarm calling), basically validates the selfish gene perspective for some circumstances. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said dna is the only container of information - wrong.

What?

The first virus isolated was an RNA virus. The first genome sequenced was an RNA genome. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They said dna could not change during the lifetime of the individual - wrong.

You mean...we thought mutations couldn't happen? Really? You sure about that?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I could keep going. There are tons of them.

By all means, keep going. This is fun.

DebateEvolution,8u1ngc,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"BIO-Complexity ""research article"" #4: ""The Evolutionary Accessibility of New Enzyme Functions: A Case Study from the Biotin Pathway"". Or put another way, ""Let's Ignore Actual Instances of the Thing We Claim Can't Happen Actually Happening.""","We're back with number 4 in our series on the so-called ""peer reviewed"" intelligent design ""research"". This time we have a paper from Ann Gauger and Douglas Axe, who, for those keeping score, have each authored one of the other papers we've discussed, and as we'll see, will continue to pump out this kind of stuff. 

&amp;nbsp;

Today's paper is called ""The Evolutionary Accessibility of New Enzyme Functions: A Case Study from the Biotin Pathway"" ([pdf here](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2011.1/BIO-C.2011.1)). In this paper, Gauger and Axe describe two structurally similar but functionally distinct enzymes, and show that several, perhaps as many as seven, specific mutations are required for one to turn into the other. 

They conclude that ""this result and others like it challenge the conventional practice of inferring from similarity alone that transitions to new functions occurred by Darwinian evolution.""

Sure. Totally.

&amp;nbsp;

As you might expect, there are some problems here. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, something I've harped on before is creationists thinking, or seeming to think, that evolution has a target. That's what this experiment tests: Go from A to B. They purport to be evaluating the ability of evolutionary processes to generate novel functions, but only evaluate the pathway to a single, known function. 

Evolution doesn't work like that. It works by generating lots of diversity and seeing what works. 

if Gauger and Axe actually wanted to test that, they'd have introduced lots of random mutations and evaluated the results for *any* new biochemical activity, not the specific activity of the target enzyme. But then of course they use these results to argue that innovation *as a whole* is prohibitively unlikely. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, going from extant state A to extant state B isn't how evolution works over long timescales, which is what we're talking about here. It's common ancestor of A and B diverging into both of them in divergent lineages. So a better way to approach this question would have been to start with the consensus sequence for the MRCA between the two enzymes in question and go from there to generate the target sequences. That still has issues (see above), but it at least more accurately represents how evolutionary histories work than what they actually did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Third, we have actual, recent instances of changes that require this degree of complexity. 

One experimental example is a novel form of extreme resistance to the antibiotic cefotaxime due to no fewer than five mutations to the enzyme beta-lactamase. See [Weinreich et al. 2006.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16601193)

And of course my favorite, HIV-1 group M VPU, which acquired a completely new function compared to ancestral SIVcpz VPU, requiring at least four and as many as seven amino acid substitutions *without selection for intermediate states*, and all happening around (or since) the time HIV-1 crossed into humans about a century ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that's not all! No, the fourth, and biggest, problem here is that they ignore work that demonstrates the appearance of novel innovations on scales far beyond what this paper is concerned with. We've generated completely novel enzymes de novo experimentally via in vitro evolution. That's starting from random sequences, not even an enzyme family, template sequence, or known target to start with. 

And yet there they are, doing exactly what these authors claim is so unlikely we should question the validity of evolutionary processes as a whole. 

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, so that's the fourth ""paper"" from this ""journal"". Another swing and miss. 

&amp;nbsp;

BTW, creationists, I know you can see this. You spend a whole of time complaining about how we're so rude and don't want to argue about the actual science. Y'all don't seem to say about any of these threads. Feel free to chime in whenever.

&gt; As stated by others, carbon date it first. If you get carbon above the background threshold, it isn't a million years old. They didn't do it because, like every other fossil being dated lately, it would have shown that it wasn't that old.

DebateEvolution,8rjubc,goccat5,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Why couldn’t the human beings and other living organisms have all originated from other simple primates?,"---------------------------------------------

Why couldn’t the human beings and other living organisms have all originated from other simple primates?
There are two illogicalities here:

------------------------------------------------
First: There is not one single evidence proving a major evolutionary development! By evolutionary development we mean; the transition of one species into another form of species. Scientists have never been able to verify or spot a single evidence on a transition from species to another and all of these are just mere speculations. So, how can an atheist choose to believe in a speculative evidence and deny our religion-based solid evidence?

--------------------------------------------------

Second: According to the “minimum gene set concept” no living organism, no matter how primary, can go below 200 genes. Nature Magazine stated in their issue dated 6-January-2006 that we could never go below the boarder of 397 genes. Energy production alone requires at least 6 genes, and if one single gene is missing the cell will not be able to provide any energy. Likewise each and every basic function requires a minimum number of genes. Scientists have found that mycoplasma is the most accurate living organism on earth; it has 468 genes and each one of these genes contains complex proteins that could be within the range of 1000 to 10000 amino acids.
Hence, if you have 3 billion specialized pieces of information – these pieces of information are imbedded inside the nucleus of each of your cells – to produce precise vital functions or even 11,000 pieces information; then you are facing a giant treasure of specialized information that has suddenly materialized.
Atheist fantasized that there were beings that emerged from a count of zero genes, but the theory of minimum gene set came to thwart this fantasy.
Obviously, all living organisms have emerged so functionally complex from the very first moment!

This is the article:[https://iconsofevolution.com/why\-darwinism\-is\-false/](https://iconsofevolution.com/why-darwinism-is-false/) it is from iconsofevolution.com:  


  
In *Why Evolution Is True*, Coyne claims that primary speciation was observed in an experiment reported in 1998. Curiously, Coyne did not mention it in the 2004 book he co\-authored with Orr, but his 2009 account of it is worth quoting in full:

“We can even see the origin of a new, ecologically diverse bacterial species, all within a single laboratory flask. Paul Rainey and his colleagues at Oxford University placed a strain of the bacteria *Pseudomonas fluorescens* in a small vessel containing nutrient broth, and simply watched it. (It’s surprising but true that such a vessel actually contains diverse environments. Oxygen concentration, for example, is highest on the top and lowest on the bottom.) Within ten days—no more than a few hundred generations—the ancestral free\-floating ‘smooth’ bacterium had evolved into two additional forms occupying different parts of the beaker. One, called ‘wrinkly spreader,’ formed a mat on top of the broth. The other, called ‘fuzzy spreader,’ formed a carpet on the bottom. The smooth ancestral type persisted in the liquid environment in the middle. Each of the two new forms was genetically different from the ancestor, having evolved through mutation and natural selection to reproduce best in their respective environments. Here, then, is not only evolution but speciation occurring in the lab: the ancestral form produced, and coexisted with, two ecologically different descendants, and in bacteria such forms are considered distinct species. Over a very short time, natural selection in *Pseudomonas* yielded a small\-scale ‘adaptive radiation,’ the equivalent of how animals or plants form species when they encounter new environments on an oceanic island.”46

But Coyne omits the fact that when the ecologically different forms were placed back into the same environment, they “suffered a rapid loss of diversity,” according to Rainey. In bacteria, an ecologically distinct population (called an “ecotype”) may constitute a separate species, but only if the distinction is permanent. As evolutionary microbiologist Frederick Cohan wrote in 2002, species in bacteria “are ecologically distinct from one another; and they are irreversibly separate.”47 The rapid reversal of ecological distinctions when the bacterial populations in Rainey’s experiment were put back into the same environment refutes Coyne’s claim that the experiment demonstrated the origin of a new species.",15,1528937976,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qxpax/creationist_attempts_to_debunk_observed/

DebateEvolution,8qoxm1,ABelgianWaff,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) Provide a Strong Case for Common Ancestry,"Endogenous Retroviruses (or ERVs) are parts of the genome left behind by particular types of viruses that infect an individual. Since the ERV stays in the DNA of an animal, it is passed down through generations and eventually spreads throughout a population.

Humans have about \~200,000 ERVs of which \~199,600 are shared in the exact same position with chimps. With evolution this is easily explained, the chimp and human share a common ancestor so all of their common ERVs have been passed down from that ancestor. However, with creation they couldn't have inherited these from the same animal because in creationism they don't share a common ancestor. So, each common ERV must have independantly inserted into the exact same position in both species. Let's find the chance of that happening.

There are approximately 3,000,000 places an ERV can insert into the human genome. That gives us the following chance of an ERV inserting into any given location.

1/3,000,000

By squaring 3,000,000, we get the following for the probability of two ERVs inserting into the exact same position in two different populations.

1/9,000,000,000,000

But humans and chimpanzees dont share just 1 ERV, they share 199,600, so by raising 9,000,000,000,000 to the power of 199,600 we get the probability of all 199,600 ERVs inserting into the same position in two populations.

1/6.3809316x10\^2,585,666

We do have to multiply by the 2,000,000 total ERVs.

1/3.1904658x10\^2,585,661

As we can see the probability that humans and chimpanzees are related, purely based on their shared ERVs is absolutely massive.

I am not and expert and may have made an error in my calculations. But I'm am quite certain that if I made an error, the real probability that humans and chimps are related is still quite huge.",30,1528857380,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qoxm1/endogenous_retroviruses_ervs_provide_a_strong/

The argument Douglas Axe makes in this piece is that even with neutral intermediates, accumulating all of the changes it would take to get a novel, complex (i.e. requiring 2 or more mutations) trait via a duplicated gene that changes via single-base substitutions would take too long. Specifically, anything requiring more than 6 mutations would take an unrealistically long time via neutral processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unsurprisingly, he relies on a number of...questionable...underlying premises to reach this conclusion. 

&amp;nbsp;

Problem 1:

&gt;Cells reproduce asexually by binary fission

Red flag. BIG red flag. BIG GIANT RED FLAG. 

We're talking about how rapidly different mutations can appear together in a single lineage. Like, how fast is it *possible*. And we going to use these findings to draw conclusions for evolution *writ large*. But we're going to omit *a major way new genotypes form*? No no no. 

Recombination, via sexual recombination or some form of horizontal gene transfer, is how you get new genotypes fast. [Take a look at this figure.](https://imgur.com/mKMf42s) 

In the bottom panel, each new mutation was appear within the lineage in which the previous has already occurred. 

But in the top, there is recombination, meaning the two mutations appear together much earlier.

Axe relies on the bottom for his calculations. Real life looks like the top, *even if it reproduces asexually*.

That alone invalidates Axe's findings, such as they are. 

&amp;nbsp;

But wait! There's more. 

Problem 2:

&gt;Genome size is stabilized by a balance between neutral duplications and neutral deletions.

Really? This is a *terrible* assumption. Genome compactness generally decreases with complexity, and most eukaryotic genomes are full of non-functional, often-repetitive sequences, indicating that there is *not* balance between neutral duplications and deletions; the duplications are much faster. These neutral regions are in turn important sources of genetic novelty, allowing lineages to explore many variants of a sequence simultaneously. 

Axe argues that the energetic cost of maintaining a bunch of neutral sequences is high enough that selection would favor a constant genome size, but this would only be true in practice if there were no other traits experiencing stronger selection. And that’s giving him a pass on that initial claim, which is questionable.

Now again, this paper is ostensibly about bacteria, but the findings are used to draw conclusions about evolution *as a whole*, which means we need to consider organisms beyond prokaryotes. The infamous Behe and Snoke (2004) did the same trick, with the same pitfall. 

&amp;nbsp;

One more.

Problem 3: 

If the population is larger than the number of sites in the genome, the argument he makes at the bottom of page 1 onto the top of page 2 falls apart. Especially true if duplication puts many copies of the gene of interest into each genome. Now the population size is not representative of the number of “tries” to “find” each mutation. Axe’s calculations ignore this, even though he purports to be looking at the evolution of paralogous genes, i.e. genes that arose via gene duplication. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s number 3 from BIO-Complexity. Another example of math that doesn’t reflect the real world being used to argue the real world doesn’t work. 

If there was a “three strikes” policy for bad research, BIO-Complexity would have been out of business by the end of 2010. ",14,1528746300,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8qcdm8/biocomplexity_research_article_3_the_limits_of/

**[Link to thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8p5loa/does_it_ever_feel_disheartening/)**


Thread starts off batshit insane from the get go, including some incredibly bold claims that just have to be discussed.

___

OP:

&gt; Does it ever feel pointless, or do you ever feel pressured to think your skepticism of the mainstream view is ridiculous? I'm struggling with that right now. From friends to family [...], everyone is constantly calling Creation lunacy, and saying that anyone who believes it shouldn't have any position if power at all. It sometimes feels like I should just give in and accept the mainstream, even though I know that's wrong. It's just really hurtful to be so ostracized from people I enjoy in my beliefs, and knowing that they might hate me if they knew. Does anyone ever feel the same?

How society deals with creationism (and science denialism in general) is a hot topic right now. From flat earthers to anti-vaxxers to global warming deniers, I think we can all agree that some form of anti-intellectualism is thriving. How we can combat that is a question of politics, education and sociology. Meaning that it's not just up to scientists to actively ""solve"" this problem. Lots of people from all kinds of sectors have to help out.

So in that regard, OP opens up a valid question, no doubt about that. How do people with fringe opinions react to being ostracized? Probably not by abandoning their fringe opinion, at least not as a direct response. It just doesn't work that way.

My only opinion here is that we as scientists have to be *real* about the facts first, and everything else comes second. What does this mean? Be respectful if you can, but that doesn't mean we have to give creationism any validity. It doesn't deserve any. Just respectfully explain that it is *pseudoscience*, everything else would bee too lenient.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, let's get to the comment section.

___










First guy basically holds a sermon and tells OP to just do what he loves and keep praying:

&gt; Hang in there, read the Bible, believe what you read, listen to good sermons and surround yourself with people who love the truth.

Sounds cute, but imho if you want to combat scientific facts, you do so by combating it scientifically, something creationists fail to do on a ~~daily~~  ~~weekly~~  ~~monthly~~  yearly basis.

Giving OP feel-good messages is exactly what I expected. Then obviously some people have to answer with bible quotes about oppression etc:

&gt; ""Then he said to the disciples, ""Anyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God, who sent me.""


Are we finished with the biblical references? Nope:

&gt; History has many instances of people being ridiculed for standing up for what's right... For starters: Jesus.

I'm personally fine with these feel-good comments. Just don't act as if you're arguing this topic on an eye-to-eye level with scientists. You aren't. You're preaching.

&amp;nbsp;


Then we come to the part were creationists try to make this an issue of creationism/atheism and having no faith, which is of course ridiculous:

&gt; What theistic evolutionists fail to realise is that evolution is incompatible with morality. Many Atheists acknowledge that without God, morals are completely arbitrary, and the honest ones will admit that this is why they like it. There is an agenda that goes with evolution to be free of accountability to a Creator.

Somebody else says exactly the same:


&gt; The Bible never said that it was going to be easy. It does say that you will be persecuted. The main struggle is people having to accept the authority of God.


Again, the same:

&gt; Just remember that those who hate the idea of the existence of God have an overwhelming motive to ridicule and dismiss the views of anyone who argues that there is evidence for creation. For them materialistic neo Darwinism must be true, there is no other game in town that can rescue them from God. [...] The world will always hate those who believe, that's something that we sign up for the day we come to faith.


When he is asked ""How do you explain theistic evolutionists?"" he says:

&gt; People who haven't done a whole lot of research and/or don't want to get in fights.

Yes, that is a *real* answer. Theistic evolutionists apparently don't really exist. Even when they are biologists.



&amp;nbsp;


**Yikes, is anything of substance coming?** As of yet, no. Here are the comments that at least try to make an argument of some sort:

&amp;nbsp;



&gt; Having a different view than the mainstream is never easy in anything. The more we learn about science and the more we learn about genetics, the more information we have.

The good old narrative of ""the more we learn, the more we're drifting away from evolution!! I swear bigly, this time for real!""


&gt; I was recently thinking the same thing as you, with the recent post in here about 90% of animals having a genetic eve ~10000 years ago gave me a surge of hope.

Some nice misunderstanding of a paper sprinkled into the mix. Not only is that a simplified, false summary of the paper, but it's also not 10k but 200k. How very careful.












Somebody else figures out that evolution is being pushed because Big Evolution owns everything:

&gt; That's peer pressure. And yes, everyone who doesn't go with the herd gets that. Especially on this topic. Scientists and 'scientists' are held in high esteem, their supporters are in the government, media, education and give out funding. Going against the words of that many bigwigs amounts to societal heresy.

Wow really makes u think. All big evolution scientists are in universities and teaching in school and educating themselves and are held in high regard and take all the nobel prizes and publish all papers and do science and discover new stuff. WTF why is my local pastor not getting funds to build his ark??



Another guy manages to be self-aware:

&gt; There are some ideas that are so bad that if you land on them, you're critical thinking, intellectual honesty, and problem solving are all brought into question. Many people consider creationism to be one of those items.

Agreed.

But this comment takes the cake:

&gt; One last thing. A friend of mine works for a Government department and processes lots of health stats in his job, including fertility stats and the monitoring of populations. **He built a model that showed that the current world's population is indicative of what we should expect if we were all descended from the eight people on the Ark, and confirms the Biblical timeline.**

No he didn't. Lmao. Also I would really like to see what he did. Please tell us more, /u/DadLoCo.

Number 2: ""A Vivisection of the ev Computer Organism: Identifying Sources of Active Information"" In which a bunch of creationists object to an evolutionary algorithm modeling evolution.","Our discussion in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8ofk62/lets_address_this_paper/) gave me an idea: Let's take each ""research article"" published in the ""peer reviewed"" ""intelligent design"" ""journal"" BIO-Complexity and analyze it as though it were a real piece of primary research literature and this was a lab meeting discussing the paper. 

Or rather, let's do this for each blog post published by the not-at-all-peer-reviewed creationist web magazine BIO-Complexity. That's more accurate. 

This is the in-house publication from Discovery Institute, and began publishing in 2010. Since then, they have published a whopping *15* pieces under the heading of ""research article"".

So let's see what the best and brightest ~~creationists~~ ~~cdesign proponentsists~~ design proponents have to offer. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first piece they published was the topic of the thread linked above. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8ofk62/lets_address_this_paper/e036xt3/) for my thoughts. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we'll talk about number two here: [""A Vivisection of the ev Computer Organism:
Identifying Sources of Active Information""](http://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2010.3/BIO-C.2010.3) (pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

The argument made in this paper is that evolutionary algorithms ""frontload"" information, so when they generate something new, it isn't actually demonstrating evolutionary processes resulting in novel information or complexity.

The authors investigated a specific program, ev, to illustrate their objections, but they are often applied elsewhere in other contexts. 

I'll note that I'm not a computer scientist, so some of this is beyond my area of expertise. So I'll focus on the evolutionary aspects rather than wade into the nitty gritty of the computational aspects. 

So let's see what the purported problems are with this program, shall we?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The perceptron structure is predisposed to generating strings of ones sprinkled by zeros or strings of zeros sprinkled by ones. Since the binding site target is mostly zeros with a few ones, there is a greater predisposition to generate the target than if it were, for example,
a set of ones and zeros produced by the flipping of
a fair coin. 

Not all types of mutations are equally likely. Treating all mutations, and therefore all potential sequences, as equally likely does not reflect biological reality.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;When some offspring are correctly announced as more fit than others, external knowledge is being applied to the search and active information is introduced. As with the child’s game, we are being told with respect to the solution whether we are getting “colder” or “warmer”. 

That's...how natural selection works? Mutations introduce variation that is either better or worse (or often about the same). Can't fault the evolutionary algorithm for operating the same way. It's kind of the point. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Two queries contain more information than one. Repeated queries can contribute active information.

I'm not *quite* sure what the objection is here, but I think it's one of two things. One is that these algorithms should not evaluate the same ""mutation"" or ""sequence"" more than once, which is silly since convergent and parallel evolution are things that happen, so the same things pop up repeatedly, and that's well documented. The second interpretation is this structure means it can be many generations before something useful appears, and that's unrealistic. But rampant junk DNA shows that this isn't a valid objection. Stuff hangs out, even if, for example, it costs energy to maintain. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;This process discards mutations with low fitness and propagates those with high fitness. When the mutation rate is small, this process resembles a simple Markov birth process that converges to the target. 

This is how selection works. The problem is the assumption that there is a built-in, predetermined target. The correct way to say this is the term ""fitness peak"". Iterative rounds of selection and mutation lead to a fitness peak. It's only a target if you know what it is beforehand and discard anything that moves you further from it. This objection amounts to ""this program simulates natural selection!""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As seen in Figure 3, the degree of mutation for ev must be tuned to a band of workable values. 

The plain english translation for this is ""if the mutation rate is too high, it doesn't work"". 

No. Shit. That's why every DNA based organism has lots of error checking and correcting mechanisms, and the only things that can use RNA are tiny viruses. 

&amp;nbsp;

So. 

The objections to this particularly evolutionary algorithm are that it models selection and mutation. And the parameters are more or less representative of how these processes work and are constrained in nature. 

Scandalous, right?

DebateEvolution,8osvnu,ADualLuigiSimulator,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Are YEC's consistent in characterizing a human ancestor when they are presented with one? I made an inquiry.,"Hi /r/DebateEvolution. First time actually making a post instead of just posting a small question...

Around 3 months ago, I posted [this picture](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7wc3n0/to_creationists_who_dont_believe_that_there_are/) to /r/Creation with the question:

&gt; ""To creationists who don't believe that there are any transitional forms between ape and man and that man was created in it current form, **how do fossils like this one fit into your worldview? Where do these creatures belong in your timeline?**""

I posted a picture of an Australopithecus sediba.

For evolutionists and antrophologists, the story is clear. It's creature that lived around 2 millions of years ago and is supposedly a human ancestor. This was us 2 million years ago and every scientists with knowledge about biology should consistently come up with the same answer.

Keyword: consistency.

So I wondered, what about creationists who deny that there even exist human ancestors like this one? Or that there are no transitions? Will they be able to be consistent with their denial? Are creationists in agreement or are they just confused?

So without going that much into detail, the thread sparked lots of discussion and I noted down every response I got from YEC creationists about what this creature is. For every YEC, I tried to hunt down their opinion about what this creature is.

Remember, evolutionists aren't in disagreement. It's a *Sediba*.

Here it goes, with usernames redacted and answers shortened or modified to be shorter:

&gt; Australopithecus sediba is actually a Australopithecus africanus.

&gt; Bones of a still undiscovered ape species, but not a human one.

&gt; It's just an African monkey.

&gt; It's a human. There is significant variation in humans and animals.

&gt; Disease and poor nutrition and genetic mutation can significantly effect development. It might be a disfigured human.

&gt; It could be a human or a variety of ape.

&gt; It could also be just an ape.

&gt; Ape, not human, therefore created on day six before Adam.

&gt; It's a member of another class of great ape that probably went extinct shortly after the flood.

u/NesterGoesBowling said ""Except this doesn’t pan out in practice.

What they found instead was that cells \(bacteria in this case\) would shed the weak\-side activity significantly more often than they would preserve it, typically because weakly performing functions usually demand too much of an energy burden \(less efficient, therefore less fit\). Natural selection ends up working against you in this scenario.

Is it possible that evolution is being driven by some other underlying mechanism, quite possibly at the quantum level, as an expression of the universe in some way? Or in some other way such as how lateral and horizontal gene transfer occur?

It seems quite plausible that the evolutionary process is occurring.

It seems quite *impossible* that life spontaneously generated from amino acids and lightning bolts.

It also seems quite *impossible* that natural selection of materialistically incurred raw error alone is enough to build full genomes.

I will keep this one shorter this time. No need to repeat myself. In what is either a trolling attempt, or perhaps the saddest display of intellectual ignorance and deafness ever, the same small group of people that I called out in [my previous post 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8n2uiu/rcreation_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_again/) decided to spend the next day searching for similar topics and they came about this article:

Title: All sperm whales had a Mitochondrial Eve “tens of thousands of years ago”

Submitted by: /u/NesterGoesBowling

**Article abstract:**

&gt; Researchers recently found a “remarkable lack of diversity” among sperm whale populations. They were able to trace the mitochondrial DNA of more than 1,000 sperm whales back to a single female tens of thousands of years ago. They’re calling this individual “Eve.”

&gt; Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the maternal side and is useful for studying long-term patterns because it evolves slowly compared to other genetic markers.

&gt; “Sperm whales have been in the fossil record for some 20 million years, so the obvious question is how one maternal lineage could be so successful that it sweeps through the global population and no other lineages survive?

___

To repeat, what were the topics I talked about [in my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8n2uiu/rcreation_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_again/) about this same topic just 24 hours prior? A short summary:

1. The MRCA of mitochondrial DNA is not the descendant of the whole species, we only trace the mitochondrial diversity to a single female. Mitochondrial DNA = ~0.03% of the whole genome. No species has a common ancestor between themselves.

2. No, mitochondrial rates do not lead back to a human mitochondrial Eve around 6000 years ago.

So far so good? Let's see if we can find any regurgitated arguments in the new thread that haven't changed one bit... 

&amp;nbsp;

*^^^Yep, ^^^we ^^^will.*

/u/NesterGoesBowling:

&gt; Another check box in the Creationist prediction column.

&gt; Yet DNA analysis of more than 1,000 whales shows a common mother “tens of thousands of years ago.” (Again, to be fair, we’ll note that this isn’t proof of creation as it could be a population bottleneck, but the latter is much less plausible given the extremely short timeframe).

Again, still being completely oblivious about what a mitochondrial MRCA is. Yet he was one of the guys that was mentioned last time. Did he even read any of the responses?

And holy shit, somebody from there actually recognizes the problem (praise Jesus).

/u/ADualLuigiSimulator:

&gt; &gt;You’re claiming neo-Darwinism predicts all sperm whales share a common ancestor a few thousand years ago?

&gt; I thought the article mentions a whale mitochondrial eve, which is the matrilinear most recent common ancestor, not the common ancestor of whales

&gt; Modern whales never died out and have existed for around 20 million years:

&gt;&gt;""Sperm whales have been in the fossil record for some 20 million years [...]""

Some abstracts of responses to that:

/u/NesterGoesBowling:


&gt; Unless this sperm whale was the only sperm whale alive at the time, in which case the above two individuals are the same.

True that, but *if you understood that this isn't the case because the article doesn't claim that, you wouldn't repeat that dozens of times* at nauseam.

/u/NesterGoesBowling:



&gt; Assuming radiometric dating isn’t flawed of course. ;)

Ahh yes, some radiometric dating denial sprinkled on top of this discussion. Isn't it great that it isn't flawed then?

Moving on to some other comments:

/u/Dzugavili:

&gt; However, creationism fails to predict the rest of the genome: you have a mitochondrial eve, not the common source for all whale genetics.

&gt; Mitochondrial DNA doesn't recombine -- this leads to such situations where lines go extinct. However, nothing about this suggests mtEve was the lone female in her society.

Correct. Then again this is our own mod, so go figure, lol.

Now how long does it take until the discussion almost inevitably goes to Nathaniel Jaenson for no apparent reason? You're correct, not long:

In direct response, /u/Dzugavili posts /u/DarwinZDF42's [own submission about this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7xnjgh/mteve_was_not_6000_years_ago/) and what is /u/NesterGoesBowling's response?

&gt; You can call it throwing if you want, just sharing but clearly you’ve been over this. I don’t buy the “refutation” tho - that group of folks are dishonest, just plain mean, and intentionally misleading.

&gt; Somwhere else in the thread he also says:

&gt; I’m curious about the topic though I’m not a molecular biologist. But I don’t trust a lot of the conclusions out there because so often the materialistic bias pervades the reasoning (i.e., Common Descent must have occurred so any evidence or theories that suggest otherwise must be ruled out a priori).

And the obvious follow-up question (that he directly got) then is:
 

&gt; What do you find to be ""intentionally misleading"" -- or as the rest of us call it, lying? That's a very strong accusation to make.

**Article: Sweeping gene survey reveals new facets of evolution**

**TL;DR:** There's different ways to analyze the genomes of different species to understand their evolutionary history (for example phylogenetic relationships).


For one, you can understand their phylogenetic history by comparing their 'nuclear' genome, or you compare their 'mitochondrial' genome.

There's several advantages to the second choice. Mitochondrial genes are highly conserved, so building (for example) phylogenetic relationships using gene trees works very well. It's similar to using ribosomal RNA for phylogenetic analysis, **except** you can utilize an awesome property of mitochondrial DNA that I will explain in the next paragraph. TL;DR: mtDNA of a species can give us some limited insight into the age of a population.


Mitochondrial DNA has another very interesting property. For one, mitochondrial DNA is only passed down by one of the parents. Because of it's a one-way inheritance, mitochondrial eve has the curious property of *potentially* being lost to its offspring, but completely separate to the rest of the genome that does get passed on. This fact means that mitochondrial DNA, unlike chromosomal DNA, actually has dead ends. In another way, it's like looking at a mitochondrial bottleneck within a population that is not experiencing a genetic bottleneck. In simple terms, mitochondrial DNA has a traceable most recent common ancestor, while chromosomal DNA doesn't. This is the case for every single sexually dismorphic species. Over time, the mitochondrial ""dead ends"" will accumulate, and the matrilineal (mitochondrial) most recent common ancestor will shift. This means that the position of mitochondrial eve shifts over time and is never one exact individual. It also means that mitochondrial eve has a very special meaning as the **mitochondrial** most recent common ancestor, but it's not a common ancestor of a species.

# [Mitochondrial Eve illustrated (important)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg/1217px-MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg.png)

[Full Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)

So in the article, they basically did this kind of analysis to come to a couple of conclusions. Analyzing around 100'000 animal species, they mostly emerged in the last couple of hundred thousand years. Note that this is *not* new or very surprising stuff. Here's some comments from the article itself:

&gt; ""The simplest interpretation is that life is always evolving,"" said Stoeckle.

Correct, ""new species emerging"" is a loaded term. It does not mean that the species *started* hundred thousands of years ago, it just means that the genome of the species in it's current form is only distinguishable as such for a range of time. Ya know, because they change over time... Kind of the whole point really.

&gt; ""It is more likely that—at all times in evolution—the animals alive at that point arose relatively recently.""

Simple but obvious point. Of course species that live now emerged recently. As long as you can specify ""recently"" this is as obvious as stating that guests in a restaurant that arrived later are probably less full than the guests that arrived earlier.

&gt; In this view, a species only lasts a certain amount of time before it either evolves into something new or goes extinct.

Correcto. This kind of cuts into the first quote. The more time passes, the more a species becomes unrecognizable to it's prior form.

Okay. So far so good. Article ends, ready for the comments in /r/Creation? What do you think? High quality? Thoughtful? Insightftul? Let's see.

/u/NesterGoesBowling

The idea here is that of all the species studied, each have a “Mitochondrial Eve” that lived about (supposedly) 200,000 years ago. To be fair, this could indicate animals that stepped off the ark, or animals that were created, or, as evolutionists prefer, just population “bottlenecks” for example in a mass extinction event like a plague etc., it might be that all survivors happened to share a great great grandmother etc.

Sorry, but this individual fell into the trap in which ...

* **[many](https://np.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/4n5xhk/creationist_confuses_mitochondrial_eve_with/)**

* **[creationists](https://np.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/58w08t/creationist_misunderstands_mitochondrial_eve_and/)**

... have fallen into.

Mitochondrial eve is not a common ancestor of a species *by definition*. It is, as I tried to explain, only the most recent common ancestor of mitochondrial DNA, which is merely a fraction of our whole genome. The rest of the genome doesn't (and can't) have a common ancestor because humans evolved in a continuous line of descendants.

&gt; Given how the dates of about 200,000 years are calculated based on expected mutation rates (and how similar dates of the “Mitochondrial Eve” of humans can be argued to support a 6,000 year timeframe)

Ah yes, this bullcrap again. This has been debunked several times over and at this point it's just stubbornness:

* [mtEve Was Not 6000 Years Ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7xnjgh/mteve_was_not_6000_years_ago/)

* [Creationist Claim: ""mtEve dates to 6000 years ago."" This is completely wrong.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6cn27r/creationist_claim_mteve_dates_to_6000_years_ago/)

&gt; it’s nice to see Creationist predictions being validated as science progresses (common ancestors thousands of years ago not millions)

I'm sorry to disappoint you buddy.

&gt; I’m sure this comment will get attacked as usual

Yup, you are getting a response. Except it's not going to be an attack, but a gentle reminder how real science works. Wrong information *needs* backlash.

&gt; but hey, the evidence is pointing away from the predictions of the dogma of neo-Darwinism, so you’d expect backlash from those who want to keep their faith in Materialism.

No evidence is ""pointing away"" here. What happened, and which is the case for 99% of these regurgitated discussions, is that creationists feel compelled to have an opinion about *everything* they see, even when they know nothing about it.

/u/allenwjones:

&gt; So basically life isn't millions of years old, all came about at the same time, and has distinct genetic boundaries?

&gt; There's something almost Biblical about this.. 🤔

Yeah, nope. I'm not even sure how anyone got this from the article. Life is not millions of years old? What? Where did that come from? All came about the same time? The article doesn't say that either. Distinct genetic boundaries? For phylogenetically separated animals? Sure thing, but I'm not sure this individual understands what this means. We completely expect genetically isolated species to be genetically isolated. Duh.

DebateEvolution,8mkbs3,natehanby,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution implies that people should have four children or more or zero and that two-child families are a bad idea.,"Here is my logic:

Random mutations are usually deleterious.

The only way—with technology that is safe and widely available—of removing deleterious mutations from the gene pool is natural selection or some other kind of selection such as artificial selection or sexual selection.

The amount of selection that can be applied to a population is a function of typical family size. 

Examples: If you have a family with 8 children, and 2 of the 8 go on to reproduce, and the others don’t, then you have potentially 75% selection.  With 4 children, if 2 go on to reproduce, you have potentially 50% selection. With 2 children, they both need to reproduce or you aren’t breeding at replacement rate—so there’s no potential selection at all. If your family line follows this culture indefinitely--two child families--then there is no process by which deleterious mutations would ever be removed if you are breeding at replacement rate. 

If the deleterious mutation rate in hominids is 1.6 per diploid genome per generation, which it is according to [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/16915), then a simple computer model I have made shows that the amount of selection must be approximately 50% simply to remove deleterious mutations as fast as they arise naturally. Which implies that typical family size should be 4, dead minimum. Of course, there are benefits to more selection beyond the bare minimum. My model suggest that quality of life will be substantially higher for our future descendants if we follow a culture of having roughly 8 children per family, with 75% of people not having children. Also, due to uncertainties in the model, it is possible that having an average family size of 4 children is not viable long term either, although in this case it would probably take many thousands of years before it would manifest as a problem.  

My rough model estimates that a culture of 2 or 3 child families will result in a deterioration of our genes such that the child mortality rate will double in approximately 300 years as compared with a standard of 8 child families and high selection pressure. In approximately two thousand years, the 2 or 3 child family culture will not be viable at all, and family size must increase to beyond 3 children per family to make up for all the people dying or failing to reproduce due to genetic disease. Of course these numbers are very rough because the model by its nature must make a lot of arbitrary assumptions, and it is difficult to predict how much medical care will be available to the typical person in the far future, so it's difficult to pin down exactly how long it will take for a culture of 2 to 3 child families to become problematic. I wrote the model in Transact SQL--if anyone wants to see my scripts to look over them, let me know. Although if you can't read SQL it's just going to be gibberish...

From studying zoology, it is very hard if not impossible find an animal that does not follow this rule. Nearly all animals average 6 offspring or more during their lifetime if they are able to reproduce. The ones who go lower than this (6 offspring per individual) are mostly endangered species, like mountain gorillas. And as for the lower limit of 4, the only exception I could find is humans in industrialized countries in the past 50 years or so. There seems to be a fundamental genetic limit to the viability of K-Type reproductive strategies—and I believe that we are currently below this fundamental limit, and I believe this will cause us genetic problems in the future within historical timescales.

DebateEvolution,8mhnj5,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Quotes from creationists no. 5,"This episode of Quotes of Creationists is about Mike Behe. The one who propagates intelligent design and who came up with the concept of Irreducible Complexity - the idea that a some complex systems are composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.

YECs love Behe for this contribution to ""debunking evilution"".

Following their habitual custom of cherry picking, they pay no attention to the fact that Behe accepts common descent, including that humans descended from other primates, although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species. He also accepts the scientific consensus on the age of the Earth and the age of the Universe. So a few quotes of what Behe wrote himself:

&gt; For the record, I have no reason to doubt that the universe is the billions of years old that physicists say it is. Further, I find the idea of common descent (that all organisms share a common ancestor) fairly convincing, and have no particular reason to doubt it. I greatly respect the work of my colleagues who study the development and behavior of organisms within an evolutionary framework, and I think that evolutionary biologists have contributed enormously to our understanding of the world. Although Darwin's mechanism – natural selection working on variation – might explain many things, however, I do not believe it explains molecular life. I also do not think it surprising that the new science of the very small might change the way we view the less small.

*Darwin's Black Box, pp 5–6.*

&gt; For example, both humans and chimps have a broken copy of a gene that in other mammals helps make vitamin C. ... It's hard to imagine how there could be stronger evidence for common ancestry of chimps and humans. ... Despite some remaining puzzles, there's no reason to doubt that Darwin had this point right, that all creatures on earth are biological relatives.

*The Edge of Evolution, pp. 71–72.*

So Behe thinks that all species, including humans, share a common ancestry. He only thinks that the evolutionary process leading to new species, cannot be fully explained by Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms alone but also by god tinkering on the molecular level bits of complex pieces. 

Of which he hasn't a speck of evidence and only *assumed* by invoking irreducible complexity, which doesn't provide evidence for special creation but only shoots a hole in evolution theory - also a *yet* to be discovered, until now unknown mechanism could well explain very complex systems - and the whole idea of irreducible complexity has been shot in pieces as well.",17,1527426747,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8mhnj5/quotes_from_creationists_no_5/
DebateEvolution,8mbcji,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Response to ""Oops, our estimation was off by a BILLION years"" Thread","So [here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/8l0keb/oops_our_estimation_was_off_by_a_billion_years/), via r/creation. Thank you to /u/xhf for highlighting an interesting paper, albeit one that significantly overstates the significance of its results. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before we go into the paper, a bit of background. We're talking about when the oxygenation of the atmosphere occurred, which has been dated to about 3 billion years ago (bya). Atmospheric oxygen is due to the splitting of water during photosynthesis by a protein complex called photosystem II, or PSII. It takes the protons and electrons in the form of hydrogen, ultimately generating O2 as a byproduct. There is another photosystem, photosystem I (PSI) that operates in a similar way, but doesn't generate O2. 

&amp;nbsp;

So in this paper, the authors performed coalescence analysis, which involves molecular clock analysis, on the PSI and PSII genes, to determine how long ago they split from each other, and they found that it was a really long time ago, maybe 4 bya. This is much earlier than expected, since oxygenic photosynthesis didn't appear until much later. 

So far so good. 

&amp;nbsp;

The authors get out over their skis when the say, therefore, oxygenic photosynthesis, and therefore atmospheric oxygenation, appeared much much earlier than we thought. 

Not only does the coalescence analysis not show that this is the case, but there are other, independent indicators of the timing of atmospheric oxygenation. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, why don't these findings support the broader conclusion? Because they show that the genes responsible for *what are now* PSI and PSII diverged about 4 bya, they cannot say that the ancestral PSII complex produced oxygen *at the time of the divergence*. They can *only* say when the split occurred. Which is interesting in itself, but not indicative of when atmospheric oxygenation occurred. 

Second, we have other ways to date oxygenation, because it had to work a specific way. THe organism that first produced oxygenic living in the oceans, because everything lived in oceans at the time. So the first thing that happens when O2 is released is it reacts with other things in the water, like iron. The iron oxides fall out of solution and accumulate on the ocean floor, resulting in banded iron formations.

Then the O2 dissolves in the ocean water. Once the oceans are saturated, *then* it begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. So by dating the banded iron, we put a hard ceiling on atmospheric oxygenation. It could have been a bit more recent, but it could not have been earlier. Period. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event#Timing) for a more detailed explanation.  

So that's what this paper does and does not show, and why.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, a quick word on the creationist take. The main response is that a billion years is an enormous error, so we can't trust any secular measure of the age of earth, life, etc. 

By way of analogy, the pro-science side says Mt. Everest is the highest point on earth. The creation side says it's Death Valley. Now we have a paper that claims it's actually K2, and OH MY GOD HOW CAN YOU TRUST ANY MEASURE OF HEIGHT. Silliness. 

The other thing is that this paper relies on coalescence analysis, which is a totally valid thing to do. Creationists seem to think that's the case...sometimes. When it makes us question when photosynthesis appeared, coalescence analysis is valid. When it shows that humanity is several hundred thousand years old, no no, can't trust that. Too many old-earth assumptions. But when those same data are manipulated into showing humanity is only six thousand years old it's good again. 

So maybe someone can clarify for me whether or not coalescence analysis is legit. That'd be great.

---

If you are an evolutionist, then you are a naturalist^(1), and thus deny that any supernatural agent is or has been at work in our universe. I, on the other hand, am a supernaturalist.

One consequence of my supernaturalist presuppositions is that our God, who is the epitome of rationality, is thus the source of all rationality that exists in His creation. I believe that you and I both are only capable of rational thought because our thinking ability was endowed upon us by our rational Creator. But alas, that wonderful fact is compromised by our sinful and irrational rebellion against our Creator, with the result that we all too often think irrational thoughts and thus arrive at irrational conclusions.

You, on the other hand, claim that the thoughts of both you and me are fashioned by evolution, which is controlled by two processes: mutation and natural selection. Mutation is obviously a completely irrational process, since it is merely random, blind, undirected, purposeless modifications to DNA, the instructions that direct the construction and maintenance of the organism they inhabit. But it is equally true that natural selection is totally irrational; its goal^(2), as it were, is survival, not truth or rationality.

If you think that natural selection is somehow rational, consider the way you evolutionists explain the fact that most people believe in a ""higher power"" (i.e., god). You would say, as I have often heard other evolutionists say, that the false belief in a higher power somehow enhanced the overall survivability of the humans that believed it. Thus, natural selection enhances survivability, not rationality or truth.

But, dear evolutionist, beware: that explanation cuts both ways! According to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, your beliefs are also entirely directed by these same processes of random mutation acted upon by irrational natural selection. You believe in evolution for no more noble reason than that such a belief somehow enhances your survivability. Your mind dupes you into thinking that your thoughts are rational when in fact, according to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, you are thoroughly irrational, just like the believers in God that you discount.

No, all rational thought, thought that seeks and discovers truth independent of irrational natural influences, must have a rational cause. That cause cannot come from within the natural sphere, because that sphere is devoid of purpose, direction, or goal of any kind, including the search for truth.

But do not dismay, you are capable of rational thought! Happily, you are in error when you deny the existence of a superintending supernatural agent. However, in order to salvage rationality, you must acknowledge the existence of the supernatural agent that ultimately causes it. When you do this, you must introduce the possibility that this same agent is responsible for aspects of nature that resist naturalistic explanations: life's origin, the existence of information and dizzying complexity in the very basement footings of life, incredible fine tuning of the universal constants, unexplainable overdesign, the existence if fresh undegraded flesh in fossils supposedly a hundred million years old, carbon-14 in diamonds supposedly just as old, functional coherence that defies gradualistic explanation, gratuitous beauty, etc., etc.

###Summary

To summarize: your naturalistic presuppositions necessarily lead you to conclude that you are just as thoroughly irrational as your supernaturalist opponents. On the other hand, my supernaturalist presuppositions allow for both of us to think rationally, as we are both the creations of a rational supernatural designer.

^(2) Natural selection is not actually goal-directed at all, but it does have the effect of enhancing survivability.

DebateEvolution,8l1l1k,ShatosiMakanoto,,,self.DebateEvolution,,A criticism of the BDMNP,"The following is not a theological rant that belongs in some other subreddit; it is an attack on the baseless, dogmatic methodological naturalistic presupposition (BDMNP) that undergirds secular science...

---

If you are an evolutionist, then you are a naturalist^(1), and thus deny that any supernatural agent is or has been at work in our universe. I, on the other hand, am a supernaturalist.

One consequence of my supernaturalist presuppositions is that our God, who is the epitome of rationality, is thus the source of all rationality that exists in His creation. I believe that you and I both are only capable of rational thought because our thinking ability was endowed upon us by our rational Creator. But alas, that wonderful fact is compromised by our sinful and irrational rebellion against our Creator, with the result that we all too often think irrational thoughts and thus arrive at irrational conclusions.

You, on the other hand, claim that the thoughts of both you and me are fashioned by evolution, which is controlled by two processes: mutation and natural selection. Mutation is obviously a completely irrational process, since it is merely random, blind, undirected, purposeless modifications to DNA, the instructions that direct the construction and maintenance of the organism they inhabit. But it is equally true that natural selection is totally irrational; its goal^(2), as it were, is survival, not truth or rationality.

If you think that natural selection is somehow rational, consider the way you evolutionists explain the fact that most people believe in a ""higher power"" (i.e., god). You would say, as I have often heard other evolutionists say, that the false belief in a higher power somehow enhanced the overall survivability of the humans that believed it. Thus, natural selection enhances survivability, not rationality or truth.

But, dear evolutionist, beware: that explanation cuts both ways! According to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, your beliefs are also entirely directed by these same processes of random mutation acted upon by irrational natural selection. You believe in evolution for no more noble reason than that such a belief somehow enhances your survivability. Your mind dupes you into thinking that your thoughts are rational when in fact, according to the evolutionary paradigm you embrace, you are thoroughly irrational, just like the believers in God that you discount.

No, all rational thought, thought that seeks and discovers truth independent of irrational natural influences, must have a rational cause. That cause cannot come from within the natural sphere, because that sphere is devoid of purpose, direction, or goal of any kind, including the search for truth.

But do not dismay, you are capable of rational thought! Happily, you are in error when you deny the existence of a superintending supernatural agent. However, in order to salvage rationality, you must acknowledge the existence of the supernatural agent that ultimately causes it. When you do this, you must introduce the possibility that this same agent is responsible for aspects of nature that resist naturalistic explanations: life's origin, the existence of information and dizzying complexity in the very basement footings of life, incredible fine tuning of the universal constants, unexplainable overdesign, the existence of fresh undegraded flesh in fossils supposedly a hundred million years old, carbon-14 in diamonds supposedly just as old, functional coherence that defies gradualistic explanation, gratuitous beauty, etc., etc.

I have an issue at the way ABIOGENESIS is presented in college textbooks (BIO 101) .. typically there are many chapters on ""evolution"" and then maybe a blurb about ABIOGENESIS &lt;inferring&gt; that it stands the same weight in terms of scientific evidence and being generally accepted. It's misleading to teach a whole generation of students that abiogensis is remotely on par with the theory of evolution..

my argument is that abiogensis is actually a very weak ""theory"" and there is little evidence that a chemical process exists to turn inorganic componds into a living organism.. in layman's terms.. if it's a ""100 step process"".. current science has been able to figure out various steps like synthesize rna or create proteins essentially steps 5-7 and 24-32 or whatever but setting up a lab that will go from 0-100 is pure fantasy at this point.. and then the process of course had to have taken place in a natural setting . clearly we have all the available compounds but they can't do it.. and then a news story comes out that scientists have been able to do one of the building blocks and we are xpected to assume that the whole process is even possible.

will science ever be able to synthsize life? we have to consider the possibility that any attempt is just alchemy.. science will never turn lead into gold.

DebateEvolution,8iy4mc,CTR0,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Hello Everybody. I'm CTR0, One of Your New Resident Moderators. I'm Here to Discuss my Role and Raise a Discussion on Some Improvements I'd Like to See.","Hello everybody.

As the title says, I'm /u/CTR0, one of the new moderators selected from the recent moderator recruitment thread. I tend to hold the majority viewpoint held in this subreddit: that the Theory of Evolution is the best supported explanation for the diversity of species, and that abiogenesis (namely the RNA-World hypothesis) is the best supported explanation for the origin of life.

I am 22 years old, and my professional CV includes a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; being a lab manager and co-lead researcher for a 20 person joint-effort synthetic biology laboratory; and, where I'm currently at, a post-baccalaureate fellowship in a genetics laboratory.

My moderation history dates back to middle school, where I played way to many video games. Namely, I jumped between several Minecraft servers up through high school in positions ranging from regular old moderator to server admin. Currently, my moderation duties include /r/Science, where I am a comment moderator (I'm one of those guys that deletes fun over there), and now here.

My lab tends to keep me pretty busy, but if you're inclined, my hobbies include playing the guitar, hiking, D&amp;D, Magic TCG, programing (python), and online gaming. I want to get into running, and my passions in conducting science extend into science advocacy and outreach.

My role here is also one of a comment moderator. I'm here to approve comments that shouldn't have been automatically removed, take down spam, etc. I intend to largely refrain from actively taking down non-spam comments (a significant portion of non-regulars violate these, but they are needed to keep discussions active), but anything that's purely antagonizing (IE personal attacks, ""You're just a fucking idiot, go read a science book,"" or ""You only reject god because you want to sin/be a bad person,"" largely things subjected to rule one while also not furthering the discussion of whatever the specific topic is) and does not contribute to continued discussion will be removed. In rare cases, I may comment on discussions violating other rules, but will leave final decisions to more senior mods.

Simply speaking, I would like this subreddit to remain an open and inviting place to discuss (with at least minor civility) evolution related subjects, both for and against. As part of this, there are two additions to the subreddit that I would like to see. *As a new moderator, I'm obviously not in a position to change subreddit policy. These changes are not planned for the near future, but I feel like this post would also be a good place to have a discussion on these subjects.*

* **The encouragement or enforcement of using NP links when linking to external subreddits.** While members of this subreddit don't actively say ""Go downvote this,"" often we provoke discussion by linking to opposing viewpoints in other subreddits (most commonly /r/Creation). Often, these linked threads will have positive votes before being linked from here, and negative votes after being linked from here, which I find to be [borderline vote brigading](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or), and I feel like it contributes poorly to the sub's reputation. It looks like, at least in the case of /r/Creation, they have used CSS to disable voting, but there are ways around that. A common one, Reddit Enhancement Suite, encourages people not to engage in discussion if they visit a NP link. Out of the respect for autonomy of other subreddits, I think that we should encourage or enforce the usage of these when linking to external subreddits. This could be through a community effort (say something when you see it), through automod (the automod could comment reminders automatically), or through a hardline stance of removing non-NP link containing comments and posts. Personally, I feel like the removal of link-only-posts and an automated reminder comment on text-posts and comments would be the best approach to this.

* **CSS Styling** Old reddit is bland. New reddit is generic. I'd like to see this subreddit get a unique look. This one is definitely more open ended, and I'd love to hear ideas in the comments. I don't know how to code reddit CSS, but there are communities out there to help and I'm open to learning (that's what /r/CTRs_Playground is for, actually).

With that, let me know if you have any questions about myself, how I intend to operate, or comments and discussion on NP links and CSS for the subreddit.",38,1526151543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8iy4mc/hello_everybody_im_ctr0_one_of_your_new_resident/

DebateEvolution,8idxqp,OlympicRunner,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"If the most important part of Evolution is random, how is the process not random?","According to the modern theory, new traits appear in organisms through random mutations. The best trait that benefits survival/reproduction of organisms are then selected to thrive relative to the rest. How is this not random?

Take for example a lottery example. You have a 1 in a million chance of winning the lottery. The winner is chosen who has the correct digits. Is the whole process of the lottery then not a random process? Remember that evolution does not know what the ""correct"" digits are. It is not working toward an end goal.

In the same way, natural selection may select the best trait AFTER it arrives by chance, but can do nothing to help that trait develop. State differently, natural selection helps survival of the fittest, but can do nothing to ensure the arrival of the fittest.

The development of new traits and differences that are beneficial to the organism are at the core of evolution. And as we know, evolution is unguided.

DebateEvolution,8iae8q,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Quote from creationism no. 4,"The one who has the dubious distinction to make his appearance this time on my list of creationist quotes is Henry Morris, who wrote:

&gt; The mean reason for insisting on the universal Flood as a fact of history and as the primary vehicle for geological interpretation is that God's Word plainly teaches it! No geological difficulties, real or imagined, can de allowed to take precedence over the clear statements and necessary inferences of the Scripture.

This leads to curious scenes on the stage where creationists put on their plays. Especially when some of them get exposed to the world of reality of geological data and observations. How those fare Glenn Morton can tell, who once found himself in this position. Let Morton [do the talk himself](http://www.oldearth.org/whyileft.htm) and I would like to include his testimony rather integrally, with some minor, unimportant texts left out to really get the picture:

&gt; For years I struggled to understand how the geologic data I worked with everyday could be fit into a Biblical perspective. Being a physics major in college I had no geology courses. &lt;...&gt; After six months of looking, I finally found work as a geophysicist working for a seismic company. Within a year, I was processing seismic data for Atlantic Richfield.

This was where I first became exposed to the problems geology presented to the idea of a global flood.  I would see extremely thick (30,000 feet) sedimentary layers. One could follow these beds from the surface down to those depths where they were covered by vast thicknesses of sediment. I would see buried mountains which had experienced thousands of feet of erosion, which required time. Yet the sediments in those mountains had to have been deposited by the flood, if it was true. I would see faults that were active early but not late and faults that were active late but not early. I would see karsts and sinkholes (limestone erosion) which occurred during the middle of the sedimentary column (supposedly during the middle of the flood) yet the flood waters would have been saturated in limestone and incapable of dissolving lime. It became clear that more time was needed than the global flood would allow. &lt;*broken links left out*&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; One also finds [erosional canyons buried in the earth](http://www.oldearth.org/Deltain3d1.gif). These canyons would require time to excavate, just like the time it takes to erode the Grand Canyon. 
&gt; 
&gt; I worked hard over the next few years to solve these problems. I published 20+ items in the Creation Research Society Quarterly. I would listen to ICR, have discussions with people like Slusher, Gish, Austin, Barnes and also discuss things with some of their graduates that I had hired.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to get closer to the data and know it better, with the hope of finding a solution, I changed subdivisions of my work in 1980. I left seismic processing and went into seismic interpretation where I would have to deal with more geologic data. My horror at what I was seeing only increased. There was a major problem; the data I was seeing at work, was not agreeing with what I had been taught as a Christian. Doubts about what I was writing and teaching began to grow. Unfortunately, my fellow young earth creationists were not willing to listen to the problems. No one could give me a model which allowed me to unite into one cloth what I believed on Sunday and what I was forced to believe by the data Monday through Friday. I was living the life of a double-minded man--believing two things.
&gt; 
&gt; By 1986, the growing doubts about the ability of the widely accepted creationist viewpoints to explain the geologic data led to a nearly 10 year withdrawal from publication. My last  young-earth paper was entitled Geologic Challenges to a Young-earth, which I presented as the first paper in the First International Conference on Creationism. It was not well received. Young-earth creationists don't like being told they are wrong. The reaction to the pictures, seismic data, the logic disgusted me. They were more interested in what I sounded like than in the data!
&gt; 
&gt; John Morris came to the stage to challenge me. He claimed to have been in the oil industry.  I asked him what oil company he had worked for.  I am going to let an account of this published in the Skeptical Inquirer in late 86 or early 87.  It was written by Robert Schadewald.  He writes,
&gt; 
&gt; ""John Morris went to the microphone and identified himself as a petroleum geologist. He questioned Morton's claim that pollen grains are found in salt formations, and accused Morton of sounding like an anticreationist, raising more problems  than his critics could respond to in the time available. He then said that the ICR staff is working on these problems all the time.  He told Morton to quit raising problems and start solving them. Morton chopped him off at the ankles.  Two questions, said Morton: 'What oil company did you work for?'  Well, uh, actually Morris never worked for an oil company, but he once taught petroleum engineering at the University of Oklahoma.  Second, How old is the Earth?' 'If the earth is more than 10,000 years old then Scripture has no meaning.'  Morton then said that he had hired several graduates of Christian Heritage College, and that all of them suffered severe crises of faith. The were utterly unprepared to face the geologic facts every petroleum geologist deals with on a daily basis.  Morton neglected to add that ICR is much better known for ignoring or denying problems than dealing with them."" 
&gt; 
&gt; It appeared that the more I questions I raised, the more they questioned my theological purity. When telling one friend of my difficulties with young-earth creationism and geology, he told me that I had obviously been brain-washed by my geology professors. When I told him that I had never taken a geology course, he then said I must be saying this in order to hold my job. Never would he consider that I might really believe the data. Since then this type of treatment has become expected from young-earthers. I have been called nearly everything under the sun but they don't deal with the data I present to them. Here is a list of what young-earthers have called me in response to my data: 'an apostate,' (Humphreys), 'a heretic' (Jim Bell - although he later apologised like the gentleman he is), ""absurd"", ""naive"", ""compromising"", ""abysmally ignorant"", ""sloppy"", ""reckless disregard"", ""extremely inaccurate"", ""misleading"", ""tomfoolery"" and ""intentionally deceitful"" (John Woodmorappe), 'like your father, Satan' (Carl R. Froede--I am proud to have this one because Jesus was once said to have been of satan also), 'your loyality and commitment to Jesus Christ is shaky or just not truly genuine' (John Baumgardner in a Merry Christmas card), ""[I] have secretly entertained suspicions of a Trojan horse roaming behind the lines..."" Royal Truman, 'a compromiser' (Henry Morris).

And there we have our henry Morris Again. Morton ends his testimony with:

&gt; But eventually, by 1994 I was through with young-earth creationISM. Nothing that young-earth creationists had taught me about geology turned out to be true. I took a poll of my ICR graduate friends who have worked in the oil industry.  I asked them one question.
&gt; 
&gt; ""From your oil industry experience, did any fact that you were taught at ICR, which challenged current geological thinking, turn out in the long run to be true? ,""
&gt; 
&gt; That is a very simple question.  One man, Steve Robertson, who worked for Shell grew real silent on the phone, sighed and softly said 'No!'  A very close friend that I had hired at Arco, after hearing the question, exclaimed, ""Wait a minute. There has to be one!""  But he could not name one.  I can not name one.  No one else could either.  One man I could not reach, to ask that question, had a crisis of faith about two years after coming into the oil industry.  I do not know what his spiritual state is now but he was in bad shape the last time I talked to him. 

This a rather disturbing testimony I must say.",15,1525907897,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8iae8q/quote_from_creationism_no_4/
DebateEvolution,8i36ij,Metamorphone,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Fusain still sinks the Flood,"Over at /r/Creation /u/Br56u7 posted this explanation from Tas Walker on why ""Flood Deposits contain abundant charcoal:

&gt;Charcoal forms from woody material that experiences elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Conditions during the Flood would have been suitable for forming charcoal. Coal measures frequently include deposits of volcanic ash, and this would have elevated the temperatures. Coal itself is formed from vegetative material that has been exposed to elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst, such as volcanic ash, and in the absence of oxygen. It is a chemical reaction and has been studied in the laboratory. As you say, charcoal would not be from the pre-Flood world, but there are many examples where it is formed post-flood.

There is so much wrong with this. First off fusain (fossil charcoal) has been experimentally demonstrated to be identical to charcoal made by **wildfires.** To quote [AA Scott:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929) 

&gt;In all physical aspects fusain is identical with wood charcoal...Charcoal cannot be distinguished from fusain microscopically.

The experiments referenced used charcoal made in a lab to demosntrate charring as a mechanism. However the fusain physically resembles wildfire charcoal. Walker is proposing some sort of underground mechanism that would work to make charcoal like we make it artificially. This doesnt explain its physical resemblance to wildfire derived charcoal, nor does it make sense. Charring requires removal of water, and this is not possible underground it waterlogged flood sediments. But then there's this part:

&gt;Conditions during the Flood would have been suitable for forming charcoal. Coal measures frequently include deposits of volcanic ash, and this would have elevated the temperatures.

This does not work, not only due to the whole fact that flood sediments would be waterlogged and not allow charring, but because lava and ash are not found associated in many huge fusain deposits. Some are, but many are not, which means Walker's mechanism does not explain the evidence. In fact, fusain is found in all sorts of deposits, Scott stating:

&gt;Charcoal is found in a very wide range of facies, from peats (Cohen et al., 1987; Rollins et al., 1993) 1997) to lake sediments (Millspaugh and Whitlock., 1995), alluvial fan deposits (Meyer et al., 1992), fluvial and floodplain deposits and marine sediments.

Also, take [this paper by Nichols and Jones.]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1992.tb02129.x) They found evidence of a truly massive charcoal deposit. Using a bare-bones minimum estimate, in which they deliberately underestimated the volume of charcoal, they still concluded that to produce such charcoal, a wildfire **bigger than modern day Ireland must have occurred**, and this estimate is likely too small by two orders of magnitude **at the least.** They found NO associated ash or lava in any deposit, leading them to conclude it was ignited by lightning. It is not possible the evidence of it just vanished. This carboniferous deposit alone falsifies Flood geology. 

Tl;dr: Walkers explanation does not work. It doesnt make sense physically, and lacks evidentiary support in very problomatic deposits (I wonder why 🤔). Neither does Sniper Lightning, BEDS which contradict ecological zonation, or the other crap I've heard slung at this issue.

DebateEvolution,8i2luu,preferpaleo,,,self.DebateEvolution,,14 Challenges to Evolution,"Hey guys, I responded to a person's post on instagram in which there was an image of skeleton, with the caption, ""Still waiting for 1 example of macroevolution."" I proceeded to show him some observed speciation events and the conversation went on from there.
I mentioned to him that he could ask me any questions he wanted. He proceeded to direct message me a series of slides (some of which are old and bad creationist arguments) with 14 challenges to evolutionanry theory by an istagram account ""jackavalone."" However due to personal events that have recently gone on in my life, I have not had time to properly respond to these 14 challenges. It has been almost a month since he has sent me these messages and so I decided to make this post and ask for your responses to them. They will probably be better than I could have answered with.

1. ""Evolutionists usually talk about small differences in creatures, but the claim of evolutionary theory is enormous- the invention of every form of life that exists or ever ever existed on Earth without using any intelligent guidance. The small differences are called, 'microevolution' but that is not evolution it is variation. Every creature has litmits to how much it can change or adapt- limits to its variation. Disease bacteria has mutations constantly and become resistant to drugs, but they always remain bacteria. 'Macro-evolution,' big change, is what the theory of evolution is about.


2. To get past the limits of variation mutations are supposed to provide information to build new organs. But all known mutations result in the loss of information. There are cases where such loss has selective advantage in certain situations, and disadvantages in other situations. Certainly, no new structure is invented. A short-circuit in a computer is like a muation in DNA, and no-one would expect to upgrade their computer that way.

3. Every structure and function in and function in a creature takes more than one change to 'invent.' It must be in the body-plan of the developing embryo, must differentiatiate stem cells into the proper tyype, must be able to receive nutrients, do waste removal and repair, must have nerves and muscles or other devices linked to a control center, and must integrate with the other elements of the biological system. If all these changes in the DNA do not happen randomly at the same time, it is impossible for a new, working organ to be made.

4. There should be many more transitional creatures in the fossil record than distinct species, many times more. But there are none- not even Archaeopteryx.

5. If life did not begin by chemicals coming togerther, there could be no evolution. Specialists have been working for 60 years on how this might have happened, and all they can produce ""naturally"" (without laboratory equipment and techniques to isolate and concentrate chemicals) are some of the many nucleotides and amino acids. They cannot make cell walls, RNA, DNA, ribosomes, organelles, cytoplasm, or cilia of even a cell or bacterium in a natural environment. After 60 years they have nothing to show but speculation and eternal hope. It is hard to prove a negavtivem but these origin-of-life specialists have come close. What we learn from their work is that life cannot arise on its own from chemicals and thus there could never be evolution.

6. Evolutionists make charts showing supposed ancestral lines of descent. They call these 'trees of life.' The problem is, different genes make different 'trees of life,' and there are tens of thousands of different genes.

7. Evolutionists are oten forced to invoke the ""parallel or convergent evolution"" fudge wheneber the same new organ appears on unrelated creatures in the fossil record. It is not an explanation, it is an excuse.

8. In every taxanomic group studied so far, around 10 to 30% of the genes are so-called 'orphan genes' becasue they are unlike genes in any other species. They are not modifications of genes from supposed ancestors; they must have formed spontaneoulsy, 'de novo'. That was formerly assumed to be impossible, and for good reason. It is essentially an admission that the foundation of evolution theory, descent with modification, is falsified. The only way to describe the existence of these genes is miraculous.

9. The Second Law of Thermodynamics requires all natural processes to become more disordered over time. It prevents the invention of new organs by mutations, becuase without a constrcution system already in place, things naturally fall apart- they don't get more complex.

10. The Law of Biogenesis (life only comes from life) has never been seen to have been violated. But evolutionists believe it must habe happneed, and maybe more than once!

11. DNA is made of only right handed versions of nucleotides, while protiens are made of only left-handed versions of amino acids. Yet any random chemical reaction that produced nucleotides or amino acids would make an equal mix of left and right-handed versions of each. Even if the thousands of nucleotides or amino acids needed to form individual DNA or protein molecules were able to combine from this mix, they would be a jumble of left and right-handed versions that could not function at all. This is the problem of chirality for evolution theory.

12. The minium number of genes needed for an organism to survive is probably 200 to 300. Most bacteria have 1000 to 4000 genes. And there are at least 17 basic things necessary for a cell to function, which must be wokring or it cannont live.

THis is the minimum LEVEL of COMPLEXITY that must be met for a cell to exist:

Replication
Recombination, and
Repair
Transcription Cell cycle control,
Mitosis, and
Melosis Defense mechanisms Cell wall/membrane
biogenesis
Signal transduction mechanisms intracellular trafficing
and secretion
translation
Post- translational modification,
Protein turnover,
Chaperones Energy prodcution and conversion
Carbohydrate transport and metabolism
Amino acid transport and metabolis
Nucleotide transport and metablims
Coenzyme transport and metabolism
Lipid transport and metabolism
Inorganic ion transport and metabolism 
Secondary metabolite biosunthesis, transport, and catabolism

13. Evolutionsts have to beieve that each protien, pure chance laoid out long strings of amino acids that fold themselves into the exact shapes needed to interact with other specialized proteins and, wjere needed, get help from chaperone proteins which themselves appeared by chance The necessary porteins cannot be invented one at a time. Either they are all there, ready to work together or nothing happens and they disintegrate. Yet even if it could design proteins, mutation-natural selection would only work on one ata time, sporadically, over many years

14. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) build and operate all living things. There are gene regulatory networks for everyhting that happens, and some networks control other networks in a chain of command. The interactions within these netwroks are so complex that attempts at mapping them quickly degenerate into mazes of interactions. Random mutations cannot produce any complexity, and this super-extreme complexity is in ebery living thing. Bottom line: Macro-evolution is physically impossible. It cannot happen; it has never happened. It is up to evolutionists, the ones making the claim, to prove otherwise.

So here the 14 challenges (sorry for any typos, I had to type every single one). I will send the guy a link to this, so that he can see the responses.

&gt;He noted that they were ""unearthed by a competent geologist, Ragazzoni ... and examined by a competent anatomist, Sergi."" Still he could not accept their Pliocene age. Faced with the uncomfortable facts, Macalister (1921, p. 183) claimed ""there must be something wrong somewhere"". ""Now, if they really belonged to the stratum in which they were found,"" wrote Macalister (1921, p. 1854, ""this would imply an extraordinarily long standstill for evolution. It is much more likely that there is something amiss with the observations."" Macalister (1921, p. 185) also said: ""the acceptance of a Pliocene date for the Castenedolo skeletons would create so many insoluble problems that we can hardly hesitate in choosing between the alternatives of adopting or rejecting their authenticity."" Here once more we find a scientist's preconceived ideas about evolutionary influencing him to reject skeletal evidence that would otherwise be considered of good quality.

And more:

&gt;Sergi (1884, pp. 303-304) stated: ""There were presented at various academies and congresses the artifacts of Tertiary man, consisting of impressions, incisions, cuts, and scraping on bone and stone, including flints chipped by the hand of man, and there followed only negativity.

DebateEvolution,8hb4c0,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,The Castenedolo fossils,"So it's about time that we provide /u/Cucked_Liberal a taste of his own medicine.

&gt; Castenedolo fossil

Now let's apply the criteria /u/Cucked_Liberal and Cremo issue to scientific work, **SHALL WE**, /u/Cucked_Liberal? 

&gt; When you can only go by verbal testimony, then the accuracy of it is based on reasoning of the testimony and the trustworthiness of its expounders.

All VERBAL testimony in Cremo's book about the Castenedolo fossils. Next.

&gt; And the trustworthiness of scientific papers is vitiated by a financial incentive. 

The Castenedolo fossils were found and examined by professional paleontologists like Ragazzoni.

&gt; Even if you have some physical trace left behind, there is no way to know that it's referring to the event described in the document, because those traces can be caused by something else. 

The Castenedolo fossils are the physical trace of the old age human fossils appear to have in Cremo's eyes this appearance can be caused by something else.

&gt; It's very easy to make claims like that. Scientific papers are only claims, and no proof.

Cremo's book section on the Castenedolo fossils are claims and no proof. He got them from Ragazzoni. Ragazzoni's scientific reports are claims and no proof.

&gt; Not always possible to investigate. The fossil is actually removed from the dig site and taken back to the lab for testing. Hence, it's all witness testimony and the entire field of paleontology and archaeology is reduced to baseless claims. ""I found this fossil in this strata."" 

Not always possible to investigate. Ragazonni took away the fossil from the Castenedolo site **and even threw it away** (Ragazzoni, 1880. p. 121), to ""his own regret"". Hence, it's all witness testimony and the entire work of Ragazonni and Cremo is reduced to baseless claims: ""I found this on the Catenedolo site"".

&gt; And pictures and videos can be misleading and there are rooms for mistake. Lighting, bad camera angle, blurring, someone standing in front, etc. 

Ragazonni made several drawings from the Castenedolo fossils. This can be misleading: the harsh winter weather he was reporting when retrieving the fossil must have plagued him.

The section about Castenedolo fossils in Cremo's book contains two figure: no. 6.4, depicting one of the skulls found at the sire and no. 6.3, a section of the Colle de Vento, near Castenedolo, drawn by Sergi. 

Pictures and videos can be misleading and there are rooms for mistake. Especially I think these ones are phony and full of false interpretations. This also applies to *all* pictures in Cremo's book. Not by purpose but just because people like Sergi and Ragazzoni can make mistakes.

&gt; In fact, this field has the most amount of hoaxes because it's so easy to fabricate data. 

So it does for Ragazonni who worked in that field.

&gt; How do I know scientists who observed speciation are telling the truth? Or that they found a fossil in some strata?

How do I know that Ragazonni found his Castenedolo fossil in Middle Pliocene strata?

&gt; That's a claim the dig site is still there. No proof it actually is. Its also possible it can be destroyed. 

I think the Castenedolo site is not there any more. It's probably destroyed. No proof it actually is.

&gt; But there is no proof that the fossil came from that strata. It has been documented that scientists have delusions, hallucinate, make contradictory claims, hide data, etc.

But there is no proof that the Catenedolo fossils came from that strata. It has been documented that scientists like Ragazzoni have delusions, hallucinate, make contradictory claims, hide data, etc. etc.

&gt; People make mistakes all the time. Several studies show most papers published are junk science. 

So the ones by Ragazzoni, DON'T YOU THINK. He must have made an error, something like ""Oops I wanted to write late Pleistocene but accidentally wrote Middle Pliocene.""

&gt; Not enough information it came from the strata. Also it does not provide as much knowledge as finding the fossil in-situ. 

Not enough information it came from the Middle Pliocene strata. Also Ragazzoni not Cremo do not provide as much knowledge as finding the fossil in-situ.

&gt; Do scientists cite other scientists' papers? If so, then they go by verbal testimony. 

Does Cremo cite scientists' papers? If so (HE DOES GALORE) he goes by verbal testimony.

&gt; There is zero chance I know some scientist found some fossil in some strata. Zero chance I know some scientist observed speciation in the wild, etc.

Including Ragazzoni, isn't it, who was a paleontologist. And found a fossil on the Castenedolo site.

What really bothers me, is AGAIN the *profound* dishonesty that characterizes EACH creationist.

Please answer the following questions &amp; provide the materials I’ve asked for.  I’m sure I’m not just speaking for myself when I’m getting frustrated by your lack of evidence for your claims.

1. You’ve stated that you believe that all creation occurred at once.  Correct me if I’m wrong but you know this from eternal scripture that is correct due to an [extremely long proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8fspjf/how_does_the_fossil_record_support_evolutionary/dycqxu0/) that we haven’t heard of in the west.  Where can we read this proof for ourselves and why haven’t western philosophers heard of a proof that would upset our worldview? Without providing this evidence your entire case is baseless.

2. Please provide the sources in Cremo’s book Forbidden Archeology that you’ve continuously referenced without sharing.  Furthermore provide the passages were he give an explanation for refuting more recent publications in archeology, including disputing Denisova’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8g74bb/outliers_gods_and_abiogenesis/dyero85/).

3. You’ve recently been claiming that [‘science is a fraud’](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8gwpix/scientists_historians_scriptures/dyfvggx/).  I don’t think anyone here has claimed science is perfect.  Everyone will tell you that it is influenced by bias, dishonesty, inept grad students, and the list goes on.  Humans are flawed. Therefore I’d welcome you to suggest a better method of studying the world around us.  Please do not claim scripture is the answer unless you’ve provided a sufficient answer for my 
first question. 

The body of knowledge that has supported the model of evolution is over 200 years old.  Yet the model has withstood everything thrown against it. As we’ve increased our knowledge base and ability to dive deeper into biology, geology, biogeography, stratigraphy, palaeontology just to name a few of the field based disciplines the theory has only strengthened. To claim that the last 200+ years of science has been entirely fraudulent is, well, for lack of a better simile, akin to saying the earth is flat.

I haven’t been keeping up with all of the ongoing conversations, so I’m sure I’ve missed some important questions, but I think it’s time you start defending your model rather than attacking the foundations of science.

DebateEvolution,8gwpix,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Scientists &gt; Historians &gt; Scriptures,"This is specifically to address the claims made by /u/cucked_liberal, ragarding the accuracy of scriptures, historical documents, and scientific papers. Specifically, he states the following:

&gt; So do your scientific papers, they only make claims. Here we go again, do you simply not understand?

&gt; Verbal testimony can be proof, because people are known to say true things. For example, what the weatherman says is accepted as true, what historians say is accepted as true. If I'm in a forest and a forest ranger says there is a fire going on, then it's evidence there is a fire.

&gt; Whether a verbal testimony can be considered evidence or not depends on the trustworthiness of the individual making the statement. And there are several ways to establish the trustworthiness of someone. For example, if someone says someone says somethings which are confirmed later on, then trust in him increases. Other ways are integrity, honesty, desire for truth, being considerate of others, having good/humane qualities, etc. All increase the trust in someone.

&gt; If verbal testimony wasn't proof, then you wouldn't be referring to papers in which scientists claim to observe things or claim to do experiments as proof. That is just hypocritical.

The fact is, not all verbal and written testimony is equal. As the title of this thread suggests, scientific papers are generally more valid than historical records, which are more valid than scriptures.

To borrow a term from Cucked, there are a number of ways we can determine a written accounts trustworthiness. The following would make a piece more trustworthy:

1. The author presents solid reasoning for their conclusions. Lots of detailed analysis, weighing multiple possible conclusions to determine the best ones.

2. The findings can be repeated.

3. The evidence is available for others to examine.

4. The author did not have motivation to lie. For example, a subordinate for a cruel king or dictator would be likely to embellish the claims of his superior.

5. Multiple sources can confirm the findings. This is especially important if the multiple sources were unlikely to have colluded, or influenced each other's bias. For example, if ancient Greek records were able to confirm what ancient Egyptian records claimed.

6. There are significant consequences for the author to have been lying, or making erroneous conclusions or assumptions. For example, a scientist would have their reputation tarnished if they did not follow proper scientific conduct.

7. The evidence is corroborated by not just different sources, but different fields. For example, confirming historical records with archaeological finds. Confirming genetic hierarchies with the fossil record.

Now when you look at scientific papers, all of the above are usually true. Historical records are likely to have most of them true, but not always.

Make no mistake, historical records are not always reliable. There is huge debate over even fairly recent events. For example, we have historical records that Napoleon died of stomach cancer. But, there is also evidence to suggest that he could have been poisoned. There is further discrepancy as to whether the poisoning was deliberate, or just accidental exposure. As it stands, the only real consensus on the matter is ""we don't know"". That's why I say scientists are generally more reliable than historical records.

Likewise, there are a number of things that would make an account less trustworthy:

1. Extraordinary claims without matching evidence. Eg. Claims of supernatural events.

2. Claims that the author would have no way of knowing or verifying themselves. It's unlikely that anyone from two millennia ago would have had any knowledge about the creation of the universe.

3. The author has motivation to lie. They make a living, or reputation in particular circles, from telling people these lies.

4. The evidence is not available to examine.

5. Multiple sources are likely to have colluded or influenced each other. Eg. writers of different installments of religious texts were biased to confirm the previous installments.

Now when you look at how religious scriptures compare, they are obviously the least trustworthy. They make extraordinary claims. They do not have reasoning for their conclusions, you're just meant to have faith that they're right. Their target audience is unwilling or unable to verify or investigate their claims. There's no process of ensuring accuracy, and indeed most of its believers don't care about accuracy.

That is why verbal testimony alone is not proof, and trusting a scientific paper or historical document is nothing like trusting a scripture.",230,1525409409,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8gwpix/scientists_historians_scriptures/

DebateEvolution,8f5u8o,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,Observation,Quote from creationism no. 3,"It's time for my next quotes by creationists.

This time I visited the website of creation.com.

So let's have [the mission statement of creation.com](https://creation.com/what-we-believe) by translating it to plain English:

&gt; The final guide to the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself.

Translation: the bible is true because the bible says so and any critics from outside of the bible can be dismissed without further ado.

&gt; The account of origins presented in Genesis is a simple but factual presentation of actual events and therefore provides a reliable framework for scientific research into the question of the origin and history of life, mankind, the Earth and the universe.

and:

&gt; The various original life forms (kinds), including mankind, were made by direct creative acts of God.

and:

&gt; The great Flood of Genesis was an actual historic event, worldwide (global) in its extent and effect.

and to be sure:

&gt; Scripture teaches a recent origin for man and the whole creation.

&gt; The days in Genesis do not correspond to geologic ages, but are six [6] consecutive twenty-four [24] hour days of Creation.

&gt; The Noachian Flood was a significant geological event and much (but not all) fossiliferous sediment originated at that time.

But what happens when you make observations that contradict these *dogmas*? Well:

&gt; Facts are always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information. By definition, therefore, no interpretation of facts in any field, including history and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the scriptural record.

In plain English: how much observations you have contradicting Genesis, it does not matter.

This is anti-science *at its finest*. It diametrically opposes the scientific attitude and methodology.

&gt; Notice how they show Australopithecus and  Homo habilis walking and looking like man lol. We know as absolute fact they were both apes and were not bipedal! They did not look like man. Remember there is no link between man and ancient apes it’s a complete fairytale and lie! We have apes then we have homo erectus which is man! Longer version &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Debate continues over the australopithecines, but close examination of the dentition and jaws, the position of the foramen magnum, the upper body bones, the rib-cage and waist, the arm, hand and phalanges, the pelvis, hip and thigh, the legs, knees and feet, and the ankle joint not only shows that they were not bipedal, but that they were ancestors of today’s great apes, the chimpanzees and gorillas. The habilines likewise have been difficult for the palaeoanthropologists to classify as a uniform group, because the evidence clearly shows that they were variants of the australopithecines and not a separate taxon within the genus Homo. Only evolutionary bias has hindered them from concluding that apes and humans are unrelated and were created separately. Homo erectus is the species name assigned to human fossils that evolutionists claim are transitional forms between australopithecines (apes) and modern humans. To date, more than 280 fossil individuals have been found that are identified with this group. The species name means “erect or upright man” and was the name first put forth by Ernst Mayr to unify the classification of Asian fossils.
&gt; Creationists generally agree that all supposed ape-men fossils are, in fact, either ape or fully human. Species names within the taxonomic genus homo are viewed as fabricated classes invented to support evolutionary theory, and should be regarded as mere instruments of propaganda.  Homo erectus fossils represent the populations of humans that lived following the global flood and the Tower of Babel, and should be considered true Homo sapiens",87,1524666642,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8etzix/how_do_we_know_that_certain_fossils_are/

If you click through, you find that the study has to do with yeast. 

Yeast are unicellular. 

So each individual cell has to do *everything*. Any gene that isn't involved in something important wouldn't be preserved. 

So, first, the relevance for multicellular things is pretty much zero. 

Second, the implications are taken to be irreducible complexity arguments.

But short version, you can have an *extant* system that requires every part, but that does not mean:

1) that the ancestral system had *only* those parts

2) that the ancestral system had the same function

3) that the ancestral system worked the same way

4) that the pathway to the present system *must have* involved selection at each step. 

All of the above conditions are required for an irreducible complexity argument to work, and none are supported.

DebateEvolution,8eojmj,TheBlackCat13,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The naturally-occurring Oklo nuclear reactors -- Implications for radioactive decay rates,"Although not strictly about evolution, this is relevant to radiometric dating, so I would like to see creationists rebuttal to the phenomena.

The [Oklo nuclear reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor) were a group of naturally-occurring light water fission reactors that formed in what is now Gabon, Africa about 1.7 billion years ago.  The reactors were able to form because back then the proportion of the less stable uranium 235 was higher in the past, meaning that there was enough U 235 in the natural uranium to support a self-sustaining chain reaction, which is not the case today.  That is why we need to “enrich” uranium today, we need to increase the proportion of U235.  Combine that with groundwater that slowed down the neutrons enough and a lack of neutron-absorbing materials, and self-sustaining chain reactions resulted.

Light water fission reactors are the most common type of fission reactor used by people, so they have been studied in excruciating detail.  We know enough minute details about how these reactors work that from the remains of the reactor we can tell how long they operated at a time, how long between each time, and how long they ran total.  

The key issue is that these reactions are extremely sensitive to small changes in the rate and energy of radioactive decay.  Even a small change to either would cause the reactor to behave differently than modern reactors in ways that would be immediately obvious.  Further, an increase in the rate of decay at any point since the reactor stopped running would have caused it to start up again.  

So from this, we can tell that the rate of decay of uranium at least has not changed significantly in the last 1.7 billion years.  This is important because Uranium decay is one of the most important dating techniques for dating very old samples.

Further, it has implications for radioactive decay rates of other elements.  The rate of radioactive decay is related to the rate of neutron capture by various elements, with this rate having different implications for different elements.  By looking at the isotope signature in the reactors, we can tell that none of these other types of decay have changed since the reactor operated, either.",11,1524608735,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/8eojmj/the_naturallyoccurring_oklo_nuclear_reactors/

The comment above was about the only thing he had to say about this stupefying list of falsifications of a 6000 years old earth. YET he managed to state that:

&gt; Sir, you have already been debunked. Sit down and learn how to rhetoric. 

More of his:

&gt; First, we do not know if the rates of decay were the same. We don't know anything about the past beyond the last verified human observation.

The usual distortion of the scientific method and why we must keep creationists out of the classrooms (*and* /u/evolution). 

I can't replay all of his weird statements but this one I cannot let slip through:

&gt; Coal was instantaneously created when the universe came into being. There was also a certain amount of radioactive decay already present at the creation of the universe. The Grand Canyon was created by the Great Flood. The fossils were deposited by the Global Flood. 

So I challenged him:

1. your evidence that coal was formed during the onset of the universe.

2. your evidence please that the universe was created.

3. your evidence that radioactivity was present at the onset of the universe.

4. your evidence that the GC was created by the flood.

5. especially your evidence how a flood can produce the particular geological stratification observed in the GC as I pointed you out to THREE times now.

6. also especially your evidence how a flood can produce the biostratification as observed world wide and evidently also in the GC. 

7. your explanation please how a flood could produce sandstone formations with remnants of dunes, cross beddings and no marine fossils.

8. your explanation how coal layers, when formed during the onset of the universe as you stated, end up *in the middle and sandwiched* between other layers?

9. your evidence of a world wide flood happening in the first place.

10. your evidence of a 6000 years old earth (or universe).

But don't expect him to answer these questions, because:

DebateEvolution,8dkg4u,chokfull,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Design does not imply a designer.,"Hey guys, I was told this would be an appropriate sub for this topic. It's something I've received a *lot* of controversy about, including people calling me stupid or dishonest for presenting my argument. This is probably my last attempt to validate this idea, but if the mods feel like this is inappropriate for this sub, let me know and I'll post it elsewhere. Some of the most common responses I have gotten tell me to post this argument in a more science-heavy subreddit like this one.

#Quick Summary

I apologize for the long post. This argument has become very in-depth. All of the smaller sections at the bottom are just responses to common arguments I've been presented with. For a quick summary: 

Design has many definitions, some of which imply intelligence, some of which do not. Our bodies clearly have function and structure. A reasonable person might describe this as ""design"". It fits well within the technical definitions, and this understanding is supported by some key biologists, although whether or not such language should be used, and when, remains controversial.


#Main Argument

It's a very common argument for theists to present that the universe shows elements of design, and design implies a designer, therefore creationism is a sensible belief. However, I posit that **design does not imply an intelligent designer**. This argument is entirely about semantics, of course, but it has many implications in our understanding of what evolution *is*, and it is a component of a separate argument that I made in an [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/8bn4lm/besides_the_standard_triomni_god_i_think_the/?st=jg1oyg0h&amp;sh=3295b362). This was a very controversial stance that I took, and so I felt that it deserved its own post. 

Now, in common usage, this is often the intent behind the word. This is why the watchmaker's analogy is so enticing. However, if we look at some of the definitions of the word and related words, we see:

**Design:** purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object; a pattern; an underlying scheme that governs functioning, developing, or unfolding; the arrangement of elements or details in a product or work of art

**Purpose:** the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists

**Function:** an activity or purpose natural to or intended for a person or thing

**Reason:** a cause for an action or event

**Scheme:** a systematic or organized configuration

None of these words *necessitate* intelligence. Particularly, ""purpose"" only requires a reason, and reason is a very general term that can be broken down to ""cause"". The human eye clearly has a function, and by extension it clearly has a purpose (purpose and function are synonyms), and therefore a design. Now, of course, for the human body as a whole, the only ""purpose"" for its design is to survive and reproduce. This purpose is not put in place by an intelligent form, but it clearly exists.

In fact, if you disagree with me about ""purpose"", there are further definitions of ""design"" that are even looser. A design can simply refer to a pattern (a synonym for design). An underlying scheme that governs functioning. The arrangement of elements in a product. None of these require intelligence, and can easily be produced by nature. *Design is a very general term that can apply to many concepts*.




Below is an excerpt from [Kenneth Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._Miller)'s *Deconstructing Design: A Strategy for Defending Science*, page 3. For a quick tl;dr, Professor Miller's main argument is that the term ""design"" has a very strong appeal, and the scientific community should embrace it rather than rejecting it. The concept of design has many advantages in helping us understand what evolution really is, and ""it does not require the scientific specialist to solve the evolutionary origins of every conceivable structure, pathway, or organ."" Miller's stance is more focused on the rhetoric behind the argument than mine is, but my main purpose here is to show that this concept has scientific backing. Miller is a prominent person in the creation vs evolution debate, and has acted as an expert witness in the [Dover Panda Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District).

&gt;*One of the keys to the public success of the ID movement
has been the tacit agreement the scientific community
has given to the creationist argument that “design
requires a designer.” Because, to most laypeople, the
form and function of everything from the human body to
a muscle cell amount to “design,” the scientist seems
forced to argue that there is no design in nature and that
the exquisite architecture of life is some sort of illusion.
This approach fails as common-sense argument, but more
importantly, it fails as science. There is indeed a “design”
to living systems—but it is not the top-down design that
would be produced by an architect or craftsman; it is a
bottom-up design that is the result of evolution.*

&gt;*We should begin our deconstruction of the design argument
by pointing out the obvious—that living systems do
show a correlation between structure and function that a
reasonable person might indeed call “design.” The structural
biologist David DeRosier (1998) acknowledged this
point exactly when he reviewed the organization of the
bacterial flagellar motor, stating that “… more so than
other motors, the flagellum resembles a machine de -
signed by a human.” The question, of course, is whether
this resemblance implies the sort of intelligent agent that
the advocates of ID would suggest. It does not, as Bruce
Alberts has pointed out (Alberts 1998). Among the questions
he would have scientists ask about “protein ma -
chines,” Alberts wrote, was “to what extent has the design
of present-day protein machines been constrained by the
long evolutionary pathway through which the function
evolved, rather than being optimally engineered for the
function at hand?” I believe that Alberts was on to something.
As his words suggest, biological complexity can
indeed show “design,” but a design revealed and constrained
by the process of evolution itself.*

&gt;*In his book, Your Inner Fish, paleontologist Neil
Shubin addressed the issue of biological design at the
physiological level by bringing evidence together from
fossils, developmental biology, and molecular genetics
(Shubin 2008). There is indeed a design to the body, as
Shubin demonstrated, a design reflecting the evolutionary
history of our species. Our skeletal structure results from
a modification of the fish body plan; our muscles are laid
out in segments that reflect the blocks of tissue associated
with each segment of the vertebrate body, and even the
complex and confusing pathways of cranial nerves can be
explained by comparison with our evolutionary relatives.*

&gt;*Even proteins can fairly be said to possess a design, yet
once again, that design makes sense only in evolutionary
terms. This fact was brilliantly exploited in a study that
used evolutionary relationships between present-day
organisms to reconstruct the actual gene for an ancestral
corticoid receptor existing some 450 million years ago
(Ortlund et al. 2007). Using the comparative structures of
two different receptor proteins, one that binds glucocorticoid
and another specific for mineralocorticoid, they
reconstructed the ancestral receptor from which both are
derived. The comparative study not only proved the value
of exploiting the evolutionary design of protein structures,
but also provided new insights into the mutational
pathways by which gene duplication generates new biochemical
systems with novel functions.*

&gt;*In short, the scientific community can make the case
for evolution by accepting the concept of design and then
demonstrating that the design of living things is an evolutionary
one. One element of the power of this approach is
that it clearly rises above the appeal to ignorance inherent
in ID. Another equally important aspect is that it does not
require the scientific specialist to solve the evolutionary
origins of every conceivable structure, pathway, or organ.
By demonstrating that well-understood cases display
clear evidence of their evolutionary ancestry, the point is
made and it is made convincingly.*






Design has many meanings. Design can be a verb or a noun, it can refer to a process or a result, it can be utilitarian or decorative, and it can refer to intelligent design and natural design. These definitions have distinct purposes, but it is important to recognize the similarities and differences among them. Design is a very broad and powerful term, and it goes against reason and against common language to combat it.


**Here are some responses to common counter-arguments I've gotten a number of times:**


#Use in common language

I've been told that this isn't the common meaning of design. However, this understanding has plenty of use in common language. A cursory reading of articles, papers, and such on this topic reveals a use of design in this manner. Many refer to the theory of evolution, when presented in opposition to creationism, as ""Design Without Designer"". One might also refer to the ""design"" in a peacocks' tail, or in a pattern of ice. 

As a matter of fact, when I present this idea to any of my friends or family members, they agree with me very readily. It seems to me that the stark opposition I face is only present in atheist-heavy communities where the idea of ""design"" has a strong negative connotation.

#Intelligence or planning

Do not be misled by the common use of the concept of design; I am not making a claim to any intelligence, consciousness, or planning behind evolution. The purpose behind my argument is to show that design does not necessarily equate to intelligence. Evolution acts randomly. Mutations happen by chance. Design *does* often imply a designer, but in this case the only ""designer"" is random natural selection (and other factors that drive evolution).

Some have argued that design and purpose imply motivation and intent. Intent more commonly implies intelligence, but it can be used as a synonym for purpose, and so can technically apply here, too. In fact, intent can be found in the very definition of ""function"", as mentioned earlier. Motivation, however, strictly refers to the reason behind someone's actions, and so *requires* intelligence.

There is no ""planning"" required for design. Normal intelligent design makes use of plans, and so is a ""top-down"" approach. However, the design I am speaking of here uses a ""bottom up"" approach.

Please also be aware that, if you intend to prove that design requires intelligence, you must prove that *all* definitions of design require intelligence. If one definition does not require intelligence, then it is perfectly valid to used design in a context that excludes intelligence. ""Design"" has many definitions, and I am aware that some of them specifically refer to intelligent design, since that is a common usage.

#Selection in evolution

Some comments have accused me of misunderstanding evolution, and attempting to attribute a sort of planning or purpose that does not really exist.

I very strongly believe I am not misunderstanding how evolution works. I know the order of operations. I do not believe that selection is the only factor that drives evolution. There is no end goal in place. There is no grand plan. I am simply attempting to apply this word to account for the complexity and clearly functional capabilities of species. Species do not simply fall together by chance - chance is involved, but there's a process to it.

I hope I can help resolve this issue by my references to Ken Miller. Mr. Miller is known for opposing creationism and intelligent design via evidence for evolution, and has published papers and given talks on this very subject. At the very least, this might help show that this isn't just some layman's misunderstanding of how evolution works, but rather the concept has legitimate scientific backing (although admittedly it remains somewhat controversial, as discussed below.)



#Devaluing purpose and design

Some have argued that if my argument is true, then water flowing downriver has purpose and design.

I do not think this is entirely untrue either. Water can carve a design into a landscape. Crystalline structures have design. There is a *reason* for both of these. However, they are less purposeful, and less designed. One thing can have more design than another. A computer has more design than a pen. Random rocks and water patterns have less purpose and design than a fully formed multicellular organism. 

#Teleology in biology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology_in_biology

Someone linked me this article as though it were proof that I was wrong. This was one of the best arguments I received, but this article only shows that the use of such language is controversial because it can lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g. intelligent design). While this may be problematic if the usage is let out of hand, I do not believe this shows me to be technically incorrect.

From the article:

&gt;Firstly, the concept of adaptation is itself controversial, as it can be taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin argued, that biologists agree with Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss in his 1759 satire Candide that this is ""the best of all possible worlds"", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions.

This is a misconception that is not evidenced by the concept of design. Design can be flawed, and very often is. A watch can be made incorrectly. Evolution is design by trial and error, which is a very flawed and inefficient method (although the only one available thanks to the lack of intelligence). Design doesn't imply perfection or optimization.


&gt;Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of natural theology, that the natural world gives evidence of the conscious design and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray.

See my arguments about intelligence. While there is a link, my entire argument is that the concept of design can be separated from intelligence.


And the rest is similar. So, the language may present certain obstacles, and certain misunderstandings may arise when not properly explained. I might be in favor of avoiding teleological language in the classroom, perhaps. However, my main argument for atheism is a reversal of the [argument from design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy) for theism, and so I find the language both technically accurate and necessary. 

#What's the point?

Some people asked me what the purpose of this argument even is. Well, if it has no value, why bother refuting it? It *is* entirely about semantics. I admit that from the start. However, I have a separate argument that utilizes this concept, so it has value to me. When I posted the argument, I received a great number of rebuttals focused around this point exactly, so I felt it was worth defending.

It also affects how these ideas are communicated. Plenty of people take a look at the world around them, and see that it has design. If they believe that, and believe that design requires a designer, they're more likely to believe in God. Language affects our perception of the world. Rhetoric affects reality. 

#You're just wrong

If you think that my definition is incorrect, that's fine. However, please remember that *I, and many other people, including biologists with a great understanding of evolution, accept this definition of ""design"".* Therefore, it's important to remember that if I, or anyone else, uses this word, they might be using a looser version of it that does not imply intelligence. Since I now better understand that this definition is controversial, I will take care to specify this understanding if it becomes important to a philosophical debate in the future.

If anyone has some alternate terminology that they feel better suits this phenomenon, I would be very open to replacing ""design"" with a new term in my argument. For now, however, I will simply clarify my intent by saying ""Natural Design"".

Ray Comfort, a crackpot who thought he had proof for creation by showing how a banana perfectly fits our hands, ""see how god created the banana to fit our hands?"", once was asked ""if evolution isn't true, how do you explain things like the blind spot in the human eye?"". His response:

&gt; I don’t have a blind spot in my eye. Both of them see very well and I am thankful for the 137million light sensitive cells that make sight possible. Do you have a blind spot in your eye? If you do, I suggest that you see an optician and see if he can either fix it, or get you another eye.

Then of course we have Ken Ham. When asked ""If God created the world 6,000 years ago or so, why are stars millions of light years away?"" he answered:

&gt; What a question! Yes, we know from the dates God gives us in the Bible that He did create the whole universe about 6,000 years ago. When we hear the term light-year, we need to realize it is not a measure of time but a measure of distance, telling us how far away something is. Distant stars and galaxies might be millions of light-years away, but that doesn’t mean that it took millions of years for the light to get here, it just means it is really far away!

The problem is there was no-one among creationists who rectified this. Another problem is that when 99% of creationists hear this blatant nonsense, they start to wave hands and shout ""Hallelujah"".

The studies had these conclusions:

DebateEvolution,8ax1w1,Metamorphone,YEC turned Agnostic Evolutionist ,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,21 Reasons Noah's Flood didn't happen,"A little while ago, Geologist Laurence Collins posted an article titled [""Twenty-one Reasons Noah’s Worldwide Flood Never Happened.""](http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/Nr38Reasons.pdf) Great read.

On [AiGNews,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=l9fqMAFABD8) YEC Andrew Snelling tried to tear these arguments down. His efforts were not great. That's what I'll show here. So let's dig in.

We start with reason 1, by Snelling saying rocks can harden in a day. He’s conflating cementation with lithification, which is dishonest from a geologic perspective. A chemical cement could harden the layer but that isn’t the same as lithifying it into rock…like, at all. Lithification takes time, much more than they have. 

Tim Helble, an Old Earth Creationist and hydrologist who works in studying YEC claims, told me this in an email a while ago on this very topic, which shows why *lithification* is not possible for the YEC timeframe. 

&gt; For Hoover Dam, if the concrete had been poured into a single huge dam-sized mold, it would have developed huge cracks and taken 125 years to cure - we still wouldn't be able to use it today and when it finally cured, the dam would be useless!  Now try to scale up to a formation that is hundreds of feet thick and covers tens of thousands of square miles like the Redwall Limestone -- it would still be a lime mush 4350 years later.  Also, the lithification process releases heat which could only be dissipated over an enormous length of time -- *If it were possible for the earth's sedimentary layers to harden in only a few thousand years, the heat released would be enough to melt the planet.*  Therefore, Roth's argument that the dissolution cavities in the Redwall were filled in with Watahomigi rock is implausible from the start.

Next for 2, Snelling says salt deposits can form from hydrothermal mechanisms underwater, not just by evaporation. True, but there are abundant deposits [showing no evidence of hydrothermal or volcanic activity.](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/hot-water) So hydrothermal activity can not be called upon for many evaporites and the problem still stands. 

Then for 3, Snelling claims the Zion Park dunes, aka Navajo Sandstone, have angles consistent with water deposition, not desert. This is incorrect. Water deposited sand wave cross-bedding rarely exceed 10 degrees, far from the 25 degrees claimed by the young earth theorists.  Eolian sand waves cross-bedding varies from 11 to 34 degrees, with an average of 25-28 degrees. The ICR [identifies](https://www.icr.org/article/marketing-navajo-sandstone) them as 20-30 degrees. Desert angles, not water angles. 

When it comes to 4, 5, 6. Snelling says the mudcracks, raindrop imprints, etc., do not resemble modern ones. This is [false.](https://imgur.com/gallery/AOkIP) 

 Fun fact, the YECs  he’s citing didn’t even analyze real raindrops. I have a WIP slideshow from Helble, refuting Whitmore’s claims about the Coconino Sandstone. I won’t share it without his OK since it isn’t done, but the uh, “raindrop imprints?” *Scorpion tracks.* You can see the tail drag marks. Really, really embarrassing. He also shows real raindrop imprints compared to modern ones, and yeah, they’re identical. 
Snelling also throws out Michael Oard’s BEDS hypothesis. [It doesn’t work,](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/oard-2011) so that’s in the garbage. 

Also lol at the healthy dose of “Were you there?™” 

On to 7 and 8. More “They’re assuming present is key to the past.” No, and if you follow the references, Collins lays out very well why so many coccoliths would not be able to survive. Instead of addressing this, or the radiolarians, he just throws out a story of a fossilized fish with another fish in it’s gut. Until he gives us the geologic context of the specific subformation it was found, this is useless. Snelling also conflates separate formations as if they’re the same. 

Also, dinosaurs and birds together with marine creatures? Yeah, no. These are [rare](https://ageofrocks.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/oceans-of-kansas-unexpected-fossils-and-young-earth-creationism/) when compared to the marine fossils and are more consistent with dead creatures being out washed than a global flood. No issue there. But boy oh boy does Snelling get mad over this. Cute. 

Next, 9. Apparently the countless coring tests done year after year don’t count, because until every rock is checked, we can’t say no pollen exists in the Grand Canyon rock layers. That’s just not true. Also, Snelling conflates rough layering a flood might produce with the ability to sort pollen by very tiny differences in shape and protrusions. That isn’t realistic, and it’s dishonest as hell. 

His final excuse, Ecological Zonation, doesn’t work. Pollen gets spread by wind, it would cover the pre-flood world, mix into the oceans, etc. It should be found in these layers, buried with the ecological zones they landed in. This isn’t hard. 

Then we have 10. He claims the jumbled crinoids being broken up supports a flood. No, it supports them dying and breaking apart before burial. He doesn’t address the problem of numbers. 

Onto 11. Snelling doesn’t address this at all, just mixes it with 10 as if it were the same problem. 

My favorite, 12. Snelling claims Volcanoes at the start of the flood could trigger wildfires, and this is what formed charcoal. They then laugh as if this is an easy solution. A no-brainer. 

It isn’t. Unfortunately for Snelling, [most fusain deposits show no evidence of volcanic activity.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929) There are exceptions, sure, but most lack nearby magmas or volcanic ash mixed within, which is least we should expect to find. It in fact seems like lighting was the cause of most wildfires, which makes sense, as it is today. So, until Snelling has evidence that there was widespread vulcanism, [which somehow left no trace of itself, even in fires bigger than all of Ireland,](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1992.tb02129.x) the objection is baseless. Huge wildfire deposits are still a falsification of a worldwide flood. And lets not forget that even if some mechanism for ignition was evident, it would not be able to cover such a wide area without being squelched by rain, sea mist, tsunamis, etc. Wildfires today can be stopped by large thunderstorms? Biblical rains? Not a chance one would survive to that size.

Then we have 13. All he does is say ""The methods are flawed™""

Lol, citation needed. I’m not taking the word of someone who doesn’t care how the methods even work, [just wants pretty numbers.](http://questioninganswersingenesis.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-does-andrew-snelling-use-rate-team.html)

For 14, 15, 16, they claim these are based on assuming the erosion rates were constant. This is disingenuous. 14 is based on evidence in the rocks, not from the modern river. 15 is about magma cooling, in a Precambrian formation. Magical flood doesn’t help here. To cool this magma they have to postulate god sucked the heat out miraculously. That’s an unscientific assertion, made last ditch, with no evidence. Nice. 16 is based on evidence from observing what rapid flash flooding does to the granite yearly. It still, with rough flash floods so full of sand they work like sandpaper, takes too long. This isn’t a naturally slow process, its that *rapid processes are still too slow for YECism* 

But nah, ramble about Uniformitarianism and don’t address the evidence. And unlike Snellings rambling defenses, Snelling is the one who didn’t do the homework. Collins did. 

Number 17 was not addressed. 

For 18, they claim they can’t see the evidence for themselves. Maybe they should read further down where pictorial evidence is given. Of course they don’t tell their listeners, who won’t bother to read the paper. 

With 19, they say Koreans showed a model of the ark could survive. 

From what I can gather, assuming I have the right study, this just isn’t the case. [The actual modeled flood conditions would be harmful.](http://www.oldearth.org/argument/N221_creation_science.htm) [More info on the study here](https://discourse.biologos.org/t/the-ark-was-a-simple-box-shape/36173/10). It just doesn’t work. 

Onto 20. ""The fountains of the deep would cause the earthquakes."" This is the one argument I’ll grant, fountains of such sort would cause some earthquakes I would think. But I don’t think Collins is entirely wrong; the claim that a tsunami formed the Great Unconformity is still without scientific support. For instance, YECs mark layers with fossil stromatolites as “preflood”, formed before the flood but after creation week. How come, then, these rocks which do showcase fossilization, have no advanced life? After all, complex life existed around then in the YEC model. Death existed, fossils were clearly being made. To claim that not one shark tooth, whale bone, clam shell, etc. managed to get fossilized, or that we’ve missed it despite countless digging efforts and how long YECs have for shells to die and be buried, is ludicrous. Other excellent details are in the book “Grand Canyon: Monument to an Ancient Earth.” 

And finally, the final reason. They just go on ranting about point 20, and don’t address things like the Surprise Canyon Formation. Go figure. That's a nail in the coffin for [Flood Geology](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7i8j1j/the_surprise_canyon_formation_a_notsolittle/)


So…this is their top mind at work. I’m not impressed. As Snelling so accurately put, “People see what they want to see.” There is no clearer example of bias blinding someone to the evidence than in Snelling’s own defenses here. He is a perfect example of [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XHGAB)

This first one is by Kurt Wise. Wise is one of the *very few* creationists who actually earned a degree in one of the life- and earth sciences. He holds a Ph.D. in paleontology and studied under Stephen Gould no less. Kurt once wrote this:

&gt; Creation isn't a theory. The fact that God created the universe is not a theory, it's true. However, some of the details are not specifically nailed down in Scripture. Some issues such as creation, a global flood, and a young age for the earth are determined by Scripture, so they are not theories. My understanding from Scripture is that the universe is in the order of 6,000 years old. Once that has been determined by Scripture, it is a starting point that we build theories upon. It is within those boundaries that we can construct new theories.

Evolutionists went on to develop the theory of evolution simply for the sake of explaining earths life forms in a way that does not involve God. Its the classic case of coming to a conclusion first and then looking for evidence to support the conclusion. Therefore, just as a creationist sees the wonder of creation in all living things, the evolutionist sees signs of evolution in all that he sees 

The claim that there are ""mountains of evidence"" in support of evolution is patently false. They are in reality mountains of convoluted material produced in favor of evolution. Much of it is based on misinterpreted fossil and DNA evidence and attempts to retrofit evolution into things. The so called ""proofs"" for evolution are just conjecture (""how it have happened"" scenarios) and speculation. 

Its no coincidence that evolution is embraced by virtually all atheists, and that many prominent atheists are passionate about *evangelising* evolution. If atheism is merely a lack of belief in God, then its strange that atheists defend/promote evolution with the same zeal as a religious apologist. 

The theory of (macro) evolution is not a real science, but the atheists own miraculous creation story.

It also echoes arguments by Jerry Coyne vs. PZ Myers:
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/when-ideology-trumps-biology/

&gt;In my earlier post I pointed out the pervasive biological evidence that in both humans and other species,  the conditions for sexual selection  hold—a greater variance in male than in female reproductive output—probably explaining why men are bigger and stronger than women, and have beards and other secondary sexual differences. It also explains why male peacocks have showy tails, why male sage grouse do “jumping displays” to attract females, why male insects have weapons and ornaments, and so on. (See my bullet-point list of biological facts in that post.) Further, though Bateman’s experiments were flawed, they have been repeated properly in other species and have shown that, yes, males in general have the potential to have many more offspring than females: a higher variance in offspring number).  -- Jerry Coyne

It explains why matriarchal societies are unlikely, the 4-sigma smartest people will be men, the number of mentally ill and homeless are men, and why heads of countries and corporations will tend to be men and societies that are not patriarchal will not compete as well as societies that are.

And thus that notion has driven philosophers to try to understand why a product of the human consciousness (ie mathematics) should be so ""unreasonably effective"" in describing something that was not created by human consciousness (ie the rest of the observable universe).

And - therefore - one possible explanation is that **both** mathematics and Reality are products of consciousness - and thus there must indeed be a connectivity between human-level consciousness and the divinely creative levels of consciousness.

Similarly Evolution has proved to be unreasonably effective in creating the vast array of life on this one planet - whilst it appears to have been completely ineffective everywhere else we have observed - from the Moon to the distant exoplanets and galaxies.

And thus it is indeed reasonable to ask why it has proven so unreasonably effective only in the place that harbors observable conscious life.

And therefore one would expect the connection between consciousness and evolution to be more actively pursued and studied.

And yet the irony is that Scientists use their very consciousness in study to assert that consciousness has no real place in Reality itself.

Therefore evolution is false.","Oh this is a good one. This is u/johnberea's go-to. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/82e5ww/convince_me_that_observed_rates_of_evolutionary/dvau38h/) a representative sample:

&gt;1.  To get from a mammal common ancestor to all mammals living today, evolution would need to produce likely more than a 100 billion nucleotides of function information, spread among the various mammal clades living today.  I calculated that out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/82e5ww/convince_me_that_observed_rates_of_evolutionary/dvata10/).

&gt;2.  During that 200 million year period of evolutionary history, about [10^20 mammals](https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/6937/how-many-organisms-have-ever-lived-on-earth) would've lived.

&gt;3.  In recent times, we've observed many microbial species near or exceeding 10^20 reproductions.

&gt;4.  Among those microbial populations, we see only small amounts of new information evolving.  For example in about 6x10^22 HIV I've [estimated](http://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/observed-evolution/hiv/) that fewer than 5000 such mutations have evolved among the various strains, for example.  Although you can make this number more if you could sub-strains, or less if you count only mutations that have fixed within HIV as a whole.  Pick any other microbe (bacteria, archaea, virus, or eukaryote) and you get a similarly unremarkable story.

&gt;5.  Therefore we have a many many orders of magnitude difference between the rates we see evolution producing new information at present, vs what it is claimed to have done in the past.

&gt;I grant that this comparison is imperfect, but I think the difference is great enough that it deserves serious attention.

&amp;nbsp;

Response:

[Short version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4bftQ4xxFc)

Long version:

There are 3 main problems with this line of reasoning. (There are a bunch of smaller issues, but we'll fry the big fish here.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem the First:** Inability to quantify ""functional information"" or ""functional nucleotides"". 

I'm sorry, *how* much of the mammalian genome is ""functional""? We don't really know. We have approximate lower and upper limits for the *human* genome (10-25%, give or take), but can we say that this is the same for *every* mammalian genome? No, because we haven't sequenced all or even most or even a whole lot of them. 

Now JohnBerea and other creationists will cite a number of studies purporting to show widespread functionality in things like transposons to argue that the percentage is much higher. But all they actually show is biochemical activity. What, their transcription is *regulated* based on tissue type? The resulting RNA is *trafficked* to specific places in the cell. Yeah, *that's what cells do*. We don't just let transcription happen or RNA wander around. Show me that it's actually doing something for the physiology of the cell. 

Oh, that hasn't been done? We don't actually have those data? Well, that means we have no business assigning a selected to function to more than 10-12% of the genome right now. It also means the numbers for ""functional information"" across all mammalian genomes are made up, which means everything about this argument falls apart. The *amount* of information that must be generated. The *rate* at which it must be generated. How that rate compares to observed rates of microbial evolution. It all rests on number that are made up.

(And related, what about species with *huge* genomes. Onions, for example, have 16 *billion* base pairs, over five times the size of the human genome. Other members of the same genus are over 30 billion. *Amoeba dubia*, a unicellular eukaryote, has over *half a trillion*. If there isn't much junk DNA, what's all that stuff doing? If most of it *is* junk, why are mammals so special?)

So right there, that blows a hole in numbers 1 and 5, which means we can pack up and go home. If you build an argument on numbers for which you have no backing data, that's the ballgame.

&amp;nbsp;


**Problem the Second:** The ecological contexts of mammalian diversification and microbial adaptation ""in recent times"" are completely different.

Twice during the history of mammals, they experienced an event called *adaptive radiation*. This is when there is a lot of niche space (i.e. different resources) available in the environment, and selection strongly favors adapting to these available niches rather than competing for already-utilized resources. 

This favors new traits that allow populations to occupy previously-unoccupied niches. The types of natural selection at work here are directional and/or disruptive selection, along with adaptive selection. The overall effect of these selection dynamics is selection for *novelty*, new traits. Which means that during adaptive radiations, evolution is happening *fast*. We're just hitting the gas, because the first thing to be able to get those new resources wins. 

In microbial evolution, we have the exact opposite. Whether it's plasmodium adapting to anti-malarial drugs, or the *E. coli* in Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment, or phages adapting to a novel host, we have microbial populations under a *single* overarching selective pressure, sometimes for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of generations. 

Under these conditions, we see rapid adaption to the prevailing conditions, followed by a sharp decline in the rate of change. This is because the populations rapidly reach a fitness peak, from which any deviation is less fit. So stabilizing and purifying selection are operating, which *suppress* novelty, slowing the rate of evolution (as opposed to directional/disruptive/adaptive in mammals, which accelerate it). 

JohnBerea wants to treat this microbial rate as the speed limit, a hard cap beyond which no organisms can go. This is faulty first because quantify that rate oh wait you can't okay we're done here, but also because the type of selection these microbes are experiencing *is going to suppress the rate at which they evolve*. So treating that rate as some kind of ceiling makes no sense. And if *that* isn't enough, mammalian diversification involved *the exact opposite dynamics*, meaning that what we see in the microbial populations just isn't relevant to mammalian evolution the way JohnBerea wants it to be. 

So there's another blow against number 5. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Problem the Third:** Evolution does not happen at constant rates. 

The third leg of this rickety-ass stool is that the rates at which things are evolving today is representative of the rates at which they evolved throughout their history. 

Maybe this has something to do with a misunderstanding of molecular clocks? I don't know, but the notion that evolution happens at a constant rate for a specific group of organisms is nuts. And yes, even though it isn't explicitly stated, this *must* be an assumption of this argument, otherwise one cannot jump from ""here are the fastest observed rates"" to ""therefore it couldn't have happened fast enough in the past."" If rates are not constant over long timespans, the presently observed rates tell us nothing about past rates, and this argument falls apart. 

So yes, even though it isn't stated outright, constant rates over time *are* required for this particular creationist argument to work.

...I'm sure nobody will be surprised to hear that evolution rates are *not* actually constant over time. Sometimes they're fast, like during an adaptive radiation. Sometimes they're slow, like when a single population grows under the same conditions for thousands of generations. 

And since rates of change are not constant, using present rates to impose a cap on past rates (especially when the ecological contexts are not just different, but complete opposites) isn't a valid argument. 

So that's another way this line of reasoning is wrong. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's so much more here, so here are some things I'm not addressing:

Numbers 2 and 3, because I don't care and those numbers just don't matter in the context of what I've described above.

Number 4 because the errors are trivial enough that it makes no difference. But we could do a whole other thread just on those four sentences.

Smaller errors, like ignoring sexual recombination, and mutations larger than single-base substitutions, including things like gene duplications which necessarily double the information content of the duplicated region and have been extremely common through animal evolution. These also undercut the creationist argument, but they aren't super specific to this particular argument, so I'll leave it there. 

&amp;nbsp;

So next time you see this argument, that mammalian evolution must have happened *millions of times faster* than ""observed microbial evolution,"" ask about quantifying that information, or the context in which those changes happened, or whether the maker of that argument thinks rates are constant over time. 

You won't get an answer, which tells you everything you need to know about the argument being made. ",246,1521161646,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/84rln5/creationist_claim_mammals_would_have_to_evolve/

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/840jhm/the_evolutionary_history_of_the_sickle_cell/dvnsfbg/

to me starting a discussion on the Faint Young Sun Paradox.  The Faint Young Sun Paradox suggests to the creationists that the fossil record is not that old.  

If the fossil record is not that old, then the patterns of similarity and diversity in biology are likely by design, not common descent and transformation by evolution, since there wouldn't be enough time to evolve things from a common ancestor.

It also suggest re-visiting other clocking methods to date the Earth.  In principle these clocks could be observed over time to see if they agree with YEC predictions.  Granted it may take a few thousand years to see some of the clocks tick, but in principle, it is a formally testable hypothesis.  There may be some clocks that are trackable in far less time.  Some YECs have suggested magnetic field studies of the planets, for example...

Astronomer Emeritus at a secular University, who happened to be a YEC, Danny Faulkner wrote:

http://www.icr.org/article/young-faint-sun-paradox-age-solar-system/

&gt;Supposedly the Sun has been a main-sequence star since its formation about 4.6 billion years ago. This time represents about half the assumed ten-billion-year main-sequence lifetime of the Sun, so the Sun should have used about half its energy store. This means that about half the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been used up and replaced by helium. This change in chemical composition changes the structure of the core. The overall structure of the Sun would have to change as well, so that today, the Sun should be nearly 40% brighter than it was 4.6 billion years ago. 

&gt;This obviously has consequences for the temperatures of the planets. It is generally believed that even small fluctuations in the Sun's luminosity would have devastating consequences on Earth's climate. A 40% change in solar luminosity should have produced dramatic climatic changes, changes perhaps comparable to the current differences between Venus, Mars, and Earth. According to evolution, about four billion years ago when life supposedly first arose on Earth, the temperature had to have been close to what the temperature is today. But if that were the case, the subsequent increase in the Sun's luminosity would have made Earth far too hot for life today. One could naively suggest that Earth began cooler than it is today and has been slowly warming with time. But this is not an option because geologists note that Earth's rock record insists that Earth's average temperature has not varied much over the past four billion years, and biologists require a nearly constant average temperature for the development and evolution of life. This problem is called the early faint Sun paradox. 


The point is, even if we suppose a mechanism like Global Warming by greenhouse gasses or moon warming by moon orbits, everything has to be miraculously fine tuned or else the Earth becomes an ice ball or becomes too hot for life.

The paradox has been claimed and disputed to have been resolved.  But even the claims of a solution require miraculous fine tuning.  It is a known paradox in the secular world, it is not something the YECs came up with, but rather co-opted from the evolutionists (pun intended).

One objection was given here by denisova:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7syy9g/how_big_of_a_gap_would_overturn_evolution_in_your/dt8wxvi/

The problem is that denisova assumes the millions of years of Earth evolution to begin with.  That is circular reasoning.  Not to mention, Earth evolution with a moon system is also rather a miraculous claim. 

So, yes, one might accept evolution of the Earth, the moon, and the fossil record, but ironically it requires statistical miracles.

There is more than just gravity needed to make a functional planet.

I was once an evolutionist, then an OEC.  But then I read the following book which argued for solar system evolution.  It had the opposite effect on me as it highlighted all the unusual events need to evolve a solar system along with LOTS of anomalies.  After reading it, I made me doubt the Solar System evolved at all, but rather it seemed a miracle created it not too long ago.

I read the book almost 14 years ago.  It transformed many of my views, ironically, toward YEC:

https://www.amazon.com/Solar-System-Evolution-New-Perspective/dp/0521675669

This thread isn't the final word.  As I said earlier, there are testable hypotheses with the clocks YECs invoke, and maybe someday I can write a review of them and their status.....

Now, are miracles and God possible?  I suggested, based purely on physics, particularly Quantum Mechanics, that secular literature says the God hypothesis is one solution to the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics:

DebateEvolution,8441lw,The_Harmonicist,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Questioning the validity of Mammalia ear evolution,"https://youtu.be/6jrguc_oXuA

Script:



The evolution of the mammalian ear was originally thought to originate from a common ancestor of synapsids and sauropsids, but eventually passed on over generations of descendent modifications going from synapsids to stem groups of mammals, down into true mammals. This line of reasoning is based on the homology of the 3 ossicle bones: the mallius, the incus, and stapes. Because the common ancestor of the two clades happen to have 1 of the 3 ossicles appearing homologous, the stapes, it follows that the same ancestral ear has diverged to mammal-like reptiles and reptile animals, including birds. Thus, it logically follows as a monophyletic trait, meaning the ear system is ancestral sharing a common origin.  

On the contrary, there appears to be a gap in the fossil record that puts this into question. In 1975 an influential paper written by Allin reported that the tympanic membrane did not actually exist in the common ancestor of synapsids and sauropsids. It was also found to be lacking in stem groups as well. He found that even though they had massive stapes, it seemed to play a role more on the jaw/skull than it did on air-sound vibrations. 

This means that the eardrums found in amniota appeared independently. Meaning that the ears of reptiles/birds and the ears of mammalian-like animals do not share a common origin that can be traced by the lines of common descent. 

If modern mammals, reptiles and birds truly did evolve from a common ancestor with a tympanic ear, it would safe to say that other structures like the external ear canal and tympanic membrane would form in the same way in the different groups. Unfortunately, that is not what the fossil record nor comparative anatomy demonstrates.

One such characteristic that separates mammalian ears from non-mammalian amniota is the structure of the external ear cannal. In one study which involved mice and chicks, researchers were interested in studying its position and how it developed. What they found was that the ear canal of chicks actually developed above the jaw joint while in mammals like mice, it developed below the jaw joint. Here, there are two different developmental pathways that are in no way similar.

Another interesting part that makes the distinction more profound is the positioning of the tympanic membrane between mammals and non-mammals. In birds and reptiles, the tympanic membrane is found to be supported by the quadrate, that is the upper jaw region while in mammals it is supported on the tympanic ring, that is lower jaw region.

What we have here; therefore, is convergence independently appearing across different groups. While evolutionists like to point out to similarities like the 3 ossicle bones, they ignore differences such as the different positionings of tympanic membrane and external ear canal. To argue that the evolution of the mammalian ear was transitioned from a single ossicle is therefore, unjustified.""

DebateEvolution,83l2qh,Benjamin5431,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Kent hovind vs aron ra debate,"https://youtu.be/gEKltaQ5HlA

This is a must see. Aron wipes the floor with kent. Kent really shows just how uneducated and misleading he is in this debate. 

Key moments of the debate

1. Aron called kent out for saying evolution teaches that we came from a rock. He explained how kent continuously says this even though he has been proven wrong. He asks kent to fix his error and admit he is wrong. He doesnt, and gives no explanation as to where he got the idea that evolution says we came from rocks. He tries to say its because oxygen escaped from cooling rocks which eventually helped form amino acids necessary fir life, aron explains that this doesnt mean the oxygen was actually part of the rock itself but was simply trapped inside of it. He explains that amino acids arent minerals, kent still wont admit he is wrong, keeps saying evolution teaches that we came from rocks. 

2. Kent wont define what a kind is after being asked repeatedly. First he says that the bible describes that a kind can only give forth after its own kind, but he admits a kind can speciate to the point that the grouos within the kind can no longer reproduce with eachother, in otherwords he admitted to macroevolution. Aron tries to explain this to him and that this is how evolution works, that kinds evolve into other kinds of that kind. 

3. Kent wont define what a kind is, wont give examples to meet arons phylogeny challenge, wont admit why he believels evolution teaches that we came from a rock but he also wont admit he is wrong about it. He keeps avoiding questions and derailing the conservation. For example when asked if mlmmoths and elephants are the same kind or are two different created kinds he avoids the question and says if a planet is made out of the same element as another planet then does that prove the planets share a common ancestor and when asked again he says idk but i know pine trees and ekephants arent the same kind. Aron responds that actually both elephants and pine trees are eukaryotic and therefore are related because they are both still eukaryotes. 

4. Kent makes the claim, multiple times, that phylogenetics is just scientists drawing lines on a paper linking random animals together for with no rhyme or reason to why they are drawing the line. He literally says scientists just decide it. Aron tries to explain that they dont just decide to draw lines to connect lineages because they feel like it, but because of evidence in genetic research and anatomical analysis and that the shared characteristics show inherited traits, not just similar traits. 

5. Aron clearly shows kent that evolution isnt a religion yet kent still keeps calling it a religion. 


During the entire debate kent didnt give a single piece of evidence for creationism. He just kept repeating that evolutionists rely on faith to assume that common traits between organisms means its related and that evolution is a religion. He kept repeating that just because a pine tree and an elephant are both eukaryotes that we shouldnt assume they are related. That was pretty much it. 

Aron confronted kent on a number of lies and claims he makes and clearly showed him why he was wrong but he woukdnt admit he was wrong. He asked multiple times to define kinds but he couldnt do it. He wouldnt answer any of the hard hitting questions but came out thinking he won the debate.",21,1520748800,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/83l2qh/kent_hovind_vs_aron_ra_debate/

I made a post a few days ago about my conversations with a creationist and i got some very helpful and detailed responses. This post will be extending from that and i had a few questions about what he is saying and i am interested to hear your thoughts on his. Thankyou. Below is my response to him after his message that can be found in part one. After that is his most recent reply. 

**My Response**

&gt; She rejected the first because of her years of studying Palaeontology.

Again, she did not reject it. She found it the least likely of her three hypothesis due to her knowledge of the overwhelming evidence against it. Of which her study of palaeontology was an influence. 

&gt; this field has foundational worldview assumptions.

No. Fields do not have worldviews. People have worldviews. 

&gt; They are philosophical naturalism and materialism, and uniformitarianism.

Scientists assume methodological naturalism. Which is different from philosophical naturalism. They do not assume philosophical materialism. We do assume Uniformitarianism. Because it is a clever assumption to make, that works. Creationists often assert that real scientists have no justification for assuming that physical laws are constant over time, and therefore, any work which is based upon this assumption (such as radiometric dating) is invalid. In reality, this Creationist assertion is not just wrong twice over, but if it were valid, it would necessarily render all science (including the Creationist version) and learning a perfect and utter waste of time.

First, real scientists don't actually presume that physical laws are constant; rather, they presume that if physical laws really did change, that change would leave traces of itself which could be detected by an appropriate experiment or observation. As such, real scientists can and do look for evidence that physical laws have changed. Empirical observations have, in fact, established that the greatest possible change which could have occured in physical laws is on the order of 1 part in several billion over the gigayears-long lifetime of the Universe.

Second, if physical laws do change in an undetectable manner, how can you trust that anything is reliable? Perhaps gravity might become a repulsive force tomorrow morning. Perhaps the molecules of your Bible might have rearranged themselves, transforming it into a copy of The God Delusion when you weren't looking. Simply put, uniformitarianism is the simpler assumption — because assuming that everything can change as it pleases, without any evidence of these variations, is unnecessary and need not be believed to explain everything we know

These same assumptions that make sure we date fossils correctly also power nuclear reactors. And we sure got those assumptions correctly considering we understand nuclear power enough to control and harness it. 

&gt; Please list what you believe to be the best Observable and repeatable evidence from the mountains to which you refer, which is exclusive to your propositions..

Read a science book. The evidence comes from a variety of fields geology, palaeontology, astronomy, biology, physics etc. There are many easily accessible and understandable sources for laypeople such as ourselves to learn about such evidence. Here is a good place to start https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-do-we-know-earth-46-billion-years-old-180951483/ 

&gt; Dr Schweitzer did not confirm her third hypothesis by observing and repeating a natural process by which the tissue could be preserved. She crafted an artificial and controlled experiment, wherein the conditions were not what any reasonable person would expect to find naturally occurring.

Yes, im sure you know what is and is not reasonable in this context better than some of the worlds best palaeontologists. 

&gt; It was nothing remotely like the conditions under which the remains were found. 

You are wrong. iron is found in living blood and is known to bind to the biochemicals found in dead tissue, stabilizing the decay process. So as the iron compounds Schweitzer found to be highly preservative are directly found in dead tissue of organisms itself, her experiments were very precisely reflecting the conditions under which in fossils tissues may be preserved.

Moreover, Schweitzer let dead tissue decay in two different ways: with respectively without those iron compounds present. The specimens with iron compounds showed no decay even after 2 years while the other specimen was completely rotten away and decayed. Yet the specimens were kept at room temperature without any further treatment. So the decay rates were purposely observed under optimal conditions for decay and degradation. In fossils in situ, the ancient organic material was found preserved within and protected by mineralized bone tissue, thus protected from air, bacterial and other forces.

&gt; with that designed and controlled experiment, she was able to extend the potential preservation to a few years, not millions.

For reasons that i hope are obvious, she cannot exactly run the experiment for millions of years. She was able to extent the preservation to two years, and after this period, blood vessels soaked in iron rich hemoglobin were found to have zero signs of decay or degradation whatsoever. Where as the blood vessels soaked in a watery iron-free solution turned to mush in just three days. So its not that the vessels soaked in iron rich hemoglobin decayed after a period of two years. They did not degrade at all. 

&gt; How are the rock layers dated?

The unambiguous convergent consensus of an array of methodologies. Including thermoluminescence, electron spin resonance and dozens of radiometric dating methods. 

&gt; By radiometric dating processes, which depend upon assumptions which cannot be known by observation or repetition

The only assumption is modern uniformitarianism. Which is not only a clever assumption to make as i have expanded upon above. But a necessary one to learn anything about the past and make predictions about the future. You might as well call me crazy for being confident that the sun will rise tomorrow because it rose in the past. 

&gt; and have produced conflicting results?

What conflicting results ? The variety of radiometric dating methods are in overwhelming agreement. 

&gt; The presence of the soft tissue alone call the dates into questions.

No it does not, and you have been presented with enough evidence to know this by now. 

&gt; The assumptions are that we know the original conditions of the samples. We cannot. It assumes thew uniformity of decay rates.

Yes, and thats completely fine. 

&gt; It assumes that conditions did not change, affecting the samples. No one has directly observed anything that is assumed in dating.

Radiometric decay isn't influenced by anything except universal constants, which also don't change. By the same logic, is it silly for me to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow ? Because i cant prove that it didn't disappear during the night ? Furthermore we do not need to know the initial conditions of the samples. 

&gt; And there is enough data to question them, making them far from conclusive, and not observable or repeatable fact.

That is false. 

&gt; If there is a natural explanation, it must operate on natural laws and principles. it must be demonstratable, now.

Like, radiometric dating?

&gt; Dr Schweitzer did not find the conditions necessary for such a process present or evidence in the original setting for the samples. She did not establish such a process by carefully crafted experimentation.

Don't you think its quite the coincidence that near enough the entire field disagrees with you ?

&gt; I do operate on a set of assumptions, arising from a world view. So do you.

What assumptions do you think i operate on ? Im genuinely intrigued 

&gt; We all have the same data. We just interpret it differently, based on worldview.

Speak for yourself. I form my worldviews around the data. Not the other way around. The data speaks for itself. 

&gt; The questions becomes one of philosophy, and which worldview can best explain all that needs explained.

No, thats wrong. There is a world of difference between an explanation and a demonstrably true explanation. The ability to offer an explanation for an event is not impressive. Demonstrating that your explanations are true are what matters. 

&gt; Philosophical naturalism and materialism are wholly insufficient for the task.

Even if that was true. It would mean nothing. There is a tremendous amount of things that i am unable to offer a sufficient explanation for. That does not entitle me to make things up however. There is no shame in ignorance. Only when it is wilful or when it is spread, is it shameful. I dont know the answers to lots of questions, and thats fine. We're working on it. 

&gt; I pointed to Dr Lewontin's quote, because he is open about what drives the faith in the model first made popular by Darwin.

Lewontin (If he said that) can speak for himself. I consider myself an apistevist. This means that i consider faith to be the most dishonest position that someone can have, and i reject it. 

&gt; As one who believes in naturalistic and materialistic explanations, he admits there really is no observable and repeatable data to support it.

If he said that, he is wrong. 

&gt; No processes that can be observed in the here and now. 

If he said that, he is wrong. 

&gt; Just an a priori commitment to a philosophy that rejects out of hand the possibility of God

That does not describe me or the vast majority of naturalists. I will accept the possibility of a god once it has been demonstrated. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**His Reply**

She assumed it least likely because she is committed to a worldview. Though the evidence pointed away from thise assumptions, she could follow. 

You are correct. The people in the field have worldview assumptions.

No. They are committed to philosophical naturalism and materialism. Itnis nit.just thay they apply a method. They will not allow for the suoernatural. This is in spite of the insufficiency of the worldview to adequately explain what needs explaining.
Uniformitarianism does not work. Itnis imposed on the data. The presence of the tissue alone calls it into question. Rapid fossilization, and canyon forming on a smaller scale, and other things add to that.

There is no observable and repeatable data that would confirm uniformitarianism. Dating methods are based on assumptions about things which cannot be known.

There is no basis for the assertion that science and learning are a waste if dating methods are wrong. This is evidenced by the fact that people learn and do science all day without them.

All scientists depend on predictable laws.of nature, based on direct observations.
The fact that samples of known age are given widely varying dates calls the assumptions into question. Dating, with various methods, of samples from within meters of each other, yield wide dates. Observable events that offer rapid results, thought to have taken long periods, call think tk question. 

It is by their assumptions that they established thentests, and the results

I would agree that physical laws do not change, unless some force acts upon them. That is why the assumptions about dating must be rejected.

It is not assumption that powers reactors. Itnis the directly observable laws.

I have srudied. Agaun, please cite what yiu believe to be the best observable and repeatable evidence, exclusive to darwinian evolution

I do know that Dr Schweizer did not observe the natural process that allegedly cause the preservation. I know she crafted artificial and controlled experiments, and no where near what was necessary. I know she did not show that even hee contrived conditions existed where the samples were found. No degree is needed for that. 

Rock layers are dated based on assumption, not observable data
Assumptions cannot be the basis for determining fact about the ancient past. Original conditoons, decay rates, and consistent conditions are all assumptions. 

I believe the sum will rise tomorrow because of today. I cannot use assumptions to determine its origins.
I can make predictions about how long a candle will burn by observing it now. I cannot determine, as a matter of fact, how long it had been burning, prior to me entering the room.

I would encourage you to do sow research into the conflicting dating results, amd ancient dates for samples of known age, for a start. 

The soft tissues are not explained by the experiment, which was essentially an insufficient attempt to rescue a worldview. 

An appeal to authority, in the case of Dr Schweizer s colleagues, is not the basis for truth. 

If you accept naturalism and materialism as a sufficient cause for the universe, life, and the laws thay govern it, then you operate on thay worldview.

And my worldview is wholly supported by the data. The data does not speak at all.

Demonstrate life from non life by natural process Demonstrate the ordering of the universe hy natural laws, from nothing. 
Demonstrate nature authoring the laws that govern it. Demonstrate the natural process that adds new, not previously oresent5, info to Dna. Demonstrate matter alone giving rise to DNA. Demonstrate matter giving rise to immaterial realities like logic and reason. Demonstrate matter giving rise to consciousness.

I would agree that making stuff up is.not the way to go. The rest of your paragraph on this is simple condescension.

DebateEvolution,81x1lq,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,A critical look at Intelligent Design: A (mostly) honest look at ID,"The A critical look at Intelligent Design, was posted on r/creation other day.

[Link to article.](https://philosophicalapologist.com/2017/07/09/a-critical-look-at-intelligent-design/)

[Link to thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/81gc6o/a_critical_look_at_intelligent_design/)

The author tries to argue for intelligent design through a critical lens. Or at least critical by the standards of your average ID proponent. To the writer's credit it does make more of an effort to address ID's critics than usual. I'd like to, in turn, critique the points made in the article.

&gt; It’s common for opponents to dismiss ID as religion, often because it has Young Earth Creationist (YEC) roots, and YEC is certainly religious in nature. This is a lazy option, as ID explicitly avoids identifying its designer, and this approach does not address ID’s arguments.

I suppose ID would not be defined as a religion, or religious. That is provided you take it only by its core definitions and statements. However, it would be very much accurate to say that ID is a large part of a religious movement, which is why it is refused to be a part of public education. It is also disingenuous to take YEC, strip it of all its positive religious claims, and then call it something else, which is exactly what ID is.

&gt; We seem quite capable at reliably inferring design produced by intelligent agents, almost without thinking. By experience we’ve learnt how to discriminate between artifacts produced by natural processes, and artifacts produced by human intelligence. It seems an almost intuitive process.

Perhaps it is intuitive. But here's the problem, it's not objective. That is the foremost scientific objection to the watchmaker argument. Seeing something and assuming design does not mean a thing, if you can't actually demonstrate that you came to that conclusion for good reasons. 

Furthermore, I do not believe that we intuitively ""detect"" design through complexity, and other traits IDists say is evidence of design. Rather I believe our intuition is the result of our understanding of developmental processes. We know what nature can do, and we know what humans can do. For example, you could take something very simple, like a coat of paint on a wall.  A coat of paint is little more than a coating of liquid. No more complex than a coat of water on a rock. Yet we understand that the former is designed, because we know nature couldn't cause that particular liquid to form that particular shape.

The latter example, of a coat of water on a rock, raises an interesting point about intuitively detecting design. It could be caused by a natural means, like rain, or an intelligent means, like someone spraying it with a hose. I would guess that if you were to ask people which it was, our intuition would fail to be as accurate as it would be for a watch. How then can we trust our intuition for life forms as well?

&gt; What about biological artifacts? We have a theory of how they might be produced by natural means. But they seem incredibly complex, and evolutionary theory hasn’t yet produced a convincing step-by-step explanation of how many (even most) biological features could have arisen.

Well, I would ask two questions to that. First, do you really need such an explanation to be convinced? And second, what do you mean by ""convincing""? I ask that, because even the detailed explanations we do have, such as those for an eye, are rejected by creationists on seemingly arbitrary grounds. I believe the opinion that they are not convincing is based on personal bias, rather than the quality of the explanations themselves.

Even though we don't have detailed pathways for most specific biological features, that doesn't mean we don't have a convincing explanation. As far as science is concerned, evolution by way of natural selection on natural genetic processes is a plausible means of evolving the life we see today. I maintain that if a creationist believes a feature needs a particular detailed explanation, they need to justify why the current ""catch all"" explanation does not suffice.

&gt; ID’s general approach is to try determine what properties of artifacts are associated *only* with design, and then identify these properties in biological features. The argument is as follows:

Right. ID will have to find objective features in biology that could only exist if they were designed. It's not enough to rely on intuition, or claim that a designer could have designed them. It has to be piece of evidence specific to design. Unfortunately for IDists, they haven't found such a thing. So far their attempts, with things like irreducibly complexity, specified complexity, ect. have failed to find either conclusive examples, or even workable definitions. At the moment, this desire for a feature that could only be designed is a hopeful hypothesis.

&gt; Complexity seems a good candidate as a design marker. Many of our human artifacts (e.g. a computer) are extremely complex.  But there are three major problems.

The problem there is the theory of evolution was developed in order to explain biological complexity. So far all evidence, through both real world observation and computer simulation, show that is capable of creating complexity. Complexity alone is not a sufficient example of a feature that could only be designed.

Thankfully the author does admit as such:

&gt; Finally, it is unclear how we could demonstrate only intelligent agents can produce such complexity.

-
&gt; Enter irreducible complexity (IC), which tries to address the third issue above. ID’s claim is that there are certain biological structures unable to be produced by natural processes, only by intelligence. A system is IC if it is “a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning” (Behe, 1996).

I will accept that, depending on the definition, IC would be a valid example of a feature that could only be designed. As Darwin himself said, if a feature couldn't be built my successive small steps it couldn't evolve. So far, I agree. But that is the minimum standard for a feature that I would call IC. Behe's definition, quoted above, is too simplistic. If a system requires a particular part to function now, it doesn't mean it always needed that part. For example, not every animal needs a heart or a brain to function, yet we would certainly die without either.

&gt; It has become common for ID proponents (initiated by Stephen Meyers) to frame their method of enquiry as an Inference to Best Explanation (IBE), largely (I think) to build a case for ID being a scientific explanation. IBE involves taking competing explanations (e.g. evolution vs ID) and deciding which one best fits the empirical data. It is particularly suitable for comparing hypotheses for non-repeatable events from the past.

The problem there is how IDists define ""best explanation"". Certainly the fact that ID posits the existence of a supremely intelligent and powerful being, causes it a significant disadvantage in being the ""best explanation"". Evolution doesn't allow itself that luxury, as we choose to develop our ideas only from mechanisms that are known to be plausible. IDists make this assumption, and dare I say this is a religious assumption. Because it's such a widely accepted idea they don't consider it warrants questioning. If you were to take an equally evidenced idea, like say advanced undetectable stealth nanobots created and controlled life, they would not tolerate that claim without question.

&gt; ID is often accused of being a “God-of-the-gaps” argument, which means invoking God for natural phenomena that science hasn’t explained.

&gt; Although this is a pejorative, it’s worth noting that there might well be genuine gaps in nature that could be empirically detectable. If so, these would suggest a supernatural designer.  The existence of such gaps is a legitimate question – the problem being demonstrating that such gaps exist as illustrated by the concept of irreducible complexity. Historically, many gaps have been closed, which has discredited this approach, and of course the supernatural element helps discredit gaps as science.

&gt; ID’s use of IBE neatly avoids the charge of being God-of-the-gaps. Rather, it is a comparison of competing hypotheses based on available empirical evidence.

The problem with god of the gaps is it is little more than a claim that if we don't know something about our natural history, then it must have been a god. It fails as an argument, mostly because it's not an inference to a best explanation. It doesn't try to take something without evidence, and replace it with an explanation with more evidence. It just says ""a god could have done this"", and leaves it at that. Considering a god is, by concept alone, something that could do anything, it is a meaningless claim.

DebateEvolution,815gj7,Duion,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,The vedic concept of evolution.,"I thought I would introduce you to another concept of evolution, that from the vedic scriptures, which is the concept of evolution of the soul.

According to the vedas the bodies do not evolve, but it is the soul that is evolving, the changing bodies on the outside are only what is visible, but the so called modern scientists or religious people cannot understand what is going on, since they do not know about the evolution of the soul that is within.

This means a soul inherits a material body according to its own level of evolution and according to its karma it evolves into higher forms of being or into lower forms of being.

Material bodies have the limited ability to adapt to other living conditions, but the bodies never change or morph into another form of material body, instead the soul will jump into another body if its evolution is high enough that it qualifies for a higher body. What we see then is death of the old body and a new body being born.

According to the veads the whole universe including ALL possible living species are created simultaneously at once and while the universe exists no species are created and no species go exstinct. The vedic scriptures are also not so vague on their own teachings, but in general give pretty exact numbers and lists on everything, for example the number of all existing species is 8,4 million in the entire universe, which even matches relatively with the estimated number by our scientists of all existing species (8,7 million): https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110823180459.htm
But this may be just a coincidence.

The vedic concept of evolution matches quite the scientific concept we have today with the big difference that the material bodies never change and it is just the soul that changes the bodies, which may lead to an observer who does not know of the soul to falsely conclude that the bodies somehow evolve, but that is not the case. The evolution of the soul goes also from aquatic -&gt; plants -&gt; insects -&gt; birds -&gt; mamals and finally humans. This also disproves creationists who also do not know of the soul and about reincarnation and about the evolution of the soul.

DebateEvolution,814ekk,Duion,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,This whole creationist vs evolutionists debate is a logical fallacy.,"I just was pointed to this subreddid if I wanted to debate evolution, but what I found was that it is only about a false duality with creationists vs evolutionists.

The logical fallacy here is that two parties are postulated to exist only in this debate and that one is postulated to be correct and the other one incorrect, where the only task in this debate is to find out which party is right. All this is absurd since how do you know that are are only two parties involved and how you know one must be correct and the other one incorrect?

The reality is more likely that there are lots of different parties with lots of different hypotheses, where as multiple parties and multiple hypothesis can be right. 

For example the following possibilities here are:

1. creationists are correct and evolutionists are incorrect
2. creationists are incorrect and evolutionists are correct
3. creationists are incorrect and evolutionists are incorrect
4. creationists are correct and evolutionists are correct

Additionally you can have partly correct cases and as well new parties could be lead into the debate which multiplies the possible outcomes every time.

So as you can see this whole debate is not really leading anywhere, since of course you can play party A against party B and one may win or be more correct than the other, but this will lead you nowhere, since the debate is about whether the theory of evolution is correct or not and even if the theory of evolution gets disproven this does not automatically prove creationists are right, that is not how it works.

To help you out I tell you how a debate works, first a hypothesis is formulated, then two parties are created and party A tries to verify the hypothesis using arguments and party B then tries to disprove the hypothesis also using arguments. When that is done the parties switch sides and party A tries to disprove the hypothesis and party B tries to prove it, that way you elimiate any bias and make sure that equal force is used to verify each side.

The end goal of such a debate is not for a party to win, but to find a solution for the problem and come closer to the objective truth about the matter.",123,1519901147,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/814ekk/this_whole_creationist_vs_evolutionists_debate_is/

So i first began this conversation when he presented what he thought was evidence of a young earth in the form of soft tissue found inside a dinosaur bone. I, having heard this before was happy to tell him that this had been solved by Dr. Mary Schweitzer. The consensus was that a new previously unknown preservation method involving crosslinking was the cause of the discovered soft tissue. He however is rejecting this completely.

He is of the opinion that the entirety of the evidence is based upon unfounded assumptions. Including naturalism, materialism and uniformitarianism.  

We have been going back and forth for a little while but i will copy and paste his last reply to me below. Although i understand that without the context of the previous message it may be a little messy. 

**His latest reply**

""*She rejected the first because of her years of studying Paleontology. This field has foundational worldview assumptions. They are philosophical naturalism and materialism, and uniformitarianism.*

*Please list what you believe to be the best Observable and repeatable evidence from the mountains to which you refer, which is exclusive to your propositions..*

*Dr Schweitzer did not confirm her third hypothesis by observing and repeating a natural process by which the tissue could be preserved. She crafted an artificial and controlled experiment, wherein the conditions were not what any reasonable person would expect to find naturally occurring. It was nothing remotely like the conditions under which the remains were found. with that designed and controlled experiment, she was able to extend the potential preservation to a few years, not millions.*

*How are the rock layers dated? By what is found in them? By radiometric dating processes, which depend upon assumptions which cannot be known by observation or repetition, and have produced conflicting results? The presence of the soft tissue alone call the dates into questions.*

*The assumptions are that we know the original conditions of the samples. We cannot. It assumes thew uniformity of decay rates. It assumes that conditions did not change, affecting the samples. No one has directly observed anything that is assumed in dating. And there is enough data to question them, making them far from conclusive, and not observable or repeatable fact.*

*If there is a natural explanation, it must operate on natural laws and principles. it must be demonstratable, now. Dr Schweitzer did not find the conditions necessary for such a process present or evidence in the original setting for the samples. She did not establish such a process by carefully crafted experimentation.*

*I do operate on a set of assumptions, arising from a world view. So do you. We all have the same data. We just interpret it differently, based on worldview. The questions becomes one of philosophy, and which worldview can best explain all that needs explained. Philosophical naturalism and materialism are wholly insufficient for the task.*

*I pointed to Dr Lewontin's quote, because he is open about what drives the faith in the model first made popular by Darwin. As one who believes in naturalistic and materialistic explanations, he admits there really is no observable and repeatable data to support it. No processes that can be observed in the here and now. Just an a priori commitment to a philosophy that rejects out of hand the possibility of God.*""",12,1519755821,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/80oqdg/hey_i_am_chatting_with_a_creationist_just_now_and/

DebateEvolution,7zcxaf,maskedman3d,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,No-Karma-II's insane card bet.,"So u/No-Karma-II is posting on crypto currency subreddits trying to create a challenge to to show evolution is too unlikely to have happened, and the prize is $10,000.

&amp;nbsp;

[The post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7zc4y8/please_help_me_design_a_challenge_that_pays_10000/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I want to demonstrate the immensity of the number of permutations of a common deck of cards, in order to prove a point in the creation/evolution controversy. To this end, I'm prepared to place in escrow $10,000, payable to the first person to guess the permutation that I hold in secret.

&gt; The general method that I think would work as the basis of this challenge, would be to create the secret one-time randomly-generated card permutation, and then create and publish a cryptographic hash of it, as represented in a fixed format. In this way, the challenger could generate ""guesses"", calculate the hash, and compare that hash to my published hash. Only when the two match would it be necessary to submit a proposed solution (and the solution would already be known to be correct).

&gt;  * I want it to be guaranteed that the payout will happen if someone produces the correct answer (viz., the funds are there and I cannot withhold payment).

&gt;  * I don't want it to be necessary that I or others trust anyone as a neutral judge.

&gt;  * If no one can produce the correct answer within a set time, say 5 years, I want the funds to revert back to me (actually, I guess this stipulation is superfluous, since I can simply produce the correct answer at any time).

&gt;  * This one is hard: I need to publicly prove that an actual correct permutation exists, before the secret permutation is revealed, without giving any clues to the solution. This is to prevent someone from charging that the published hash does not map to a valid card sequence.

&gt; I think that this may be possible to do, using things like zero-knowledge proofs and cryptocurrency.

&gt; Ideas?

That's right people, a shuffled decks of cards, the Evilutionist's^TM undoing. I feel this challenge shows just how little No-Karma-II understands biology.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't even know where to begin here. Does No-Karma-II not understand that DNA used 4 nucleobases and not 52? That nucleobase sequences repeat? What about guessing? In evolution you keep best outcomes and pass them on. If someone guess the first card correct do they get to guess again since they already know what the first card is? It wouldn't take long to spam guess cycling through the position of all 52 cards in the first spot until you got it right, then moving on to the second card.

&amp;nbsp;

But none of that would even matter because evolution doesn't have a goal, there is no ideal sequence that is trying to be reached.

DebateEvolution,7ywyy4,QuestioningDarwin,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,Can genetic entropy be historically proven/disproven for the evolution of animals with larger genomes?,"The debates on Mendel’s Accountant and genetic entropy which I can find with the search functions on this sub mostly focus on the technical side of it, and I have read these discussions with great interest. I wonder, however, specifically whether or not the issue can be resolved through this empirical evidence.

The reason I specify larger genomes is that most of the experiments I have seen, and which are discussed here, are in micro-organisms and flies, where creationists typically respond that the genomes are too small for the data to be extrapolated, and that genetic entropy will doubtless remain a problem for more complex organisms such as ourselves.

Whether or not this rationalisation is correct (and I assume many of you will be of the view that it isn’t) I wondered whether similar observational evidence from experiments or recorded historical data (so excluding palaeontology) could be used to prove/disprove the idea of genetic entropy/Haldane’s Dilemma/Mendel’s Accountant for larger animals. Do these models make falsifiable predictions here?

To give an example of the kind of evidence I would find particularly persuasive, u/Dzugavili’s Grand List of Rule #7 arguments states that

&gt; Furthermore, we have genetic samples dating back several thousands of years, and the predictions made by Mendel's Accountant do not pan out: Mendel's Accountant suggests we should each have thousands of negative mutations not see in the genome even 1000 years ago, but historical evidence suggests genetic disease has relatively constant throughout history.

DebateEvolution,7y32kb,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,Quick Lesson: Error Catastrophe vs. Extinction Vortex,"[Here's an interesting OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7y0281/a_thought_experiment_about_genetic_entropy/) The question is this:

&gt;What would it look like if a species were to go extinct as a result of genetic entropy?

JohnBerea answers thusly:

&gt;I think it would be pretty difficult to distinguish it from other causes of extinction. As the diversity of beneficial alleles decreases and is lost from the population, it becomes more difficult for it to adapt to changing environmental pressures. Then the population whenever it faces disease, predation, or an unusually harsh winter. Then with smaller numbers, inbreeding increases, accelerating the process.

&gt;So did the species go extinct from a harsh environment, from inbreeding, or from genetic entropy? That's like asking whether a man was killed by a gun or a bullet.

This is actually a really good question, and John's answer conflates two different potential causes for extinction. So let's talk about how we can tell the cause of extinction if we are in a position to observe it.

&amp;nbsp;

First, some vocabulary:

**Error catastrophe** is the accumulation of harmful alleles, primarily due to mutation rates, which results in a decrease in the average reproductive output of a population to below the level of replacement, eventually leading to extinction.

An **extinction vortex** is when a population drops below a threshold (the **minimum viable population**, or MVP), resulting the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift, and an increase in harmful recessive traits due to inbreeding. Consequently, subsequent generations have even lower fitness, so each successive generation is smaller, leading to stronger drift, more inbreeding, and therefore lower fitness, eventually culminating with extinction. 

**Genetic entropy** is a term invented by creationists that biologists don't actually use. The real term is error catastrophe, as described above. 

&amp;nbsp;

So if we have a population that we're watching, and it is shrinking, clearly on its way to extinction, can we tell if it's going extinct due to error catastrophe vs. an extinction vortex?

Yes we can. 

The key is the survey the genetic diversity. 

Error catastrophe is driven by mutation rate and mutation accumulation. It's a decrease in fitness due to the accumulation of many new, deleterious alleles. So if this is the case, we'd expect to *high* diversity and very *low* levels of homozygosity. 

An extinction vortex, genetically, is the opposite. It's fitness decreases due to the *loss* of alleles and subsequent increase in the frequency of deleterious recessive traits. So in a population in an extinction vortex, we expect to see *low* diversity and very *high* levels of homozygosity. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what do we see? Well, in small populations that are or were threatened with extinction, whenever we've been able to check (we don't always have the resources survey), we see an extinction vortex, *not* error catastrophe. In other words, we see low diversity and high homozygosity. We also know this is the case because of how we can rescue threatened populations: We've actually been able to *save* species with injections of genetic diversity from related populations or species. If those threatened populations were experiencing error catastrophe, the added diversity would have made the problem worse, not better. The textbook case of an extinction vortex rescue like this was the greater Illinois prairie chicken in the 90s. 

&amp;nbsp;

So. Error catastrophe or extinction vortex? They are opposites, we *can* tell the difference, and it's never been error catastrophe. ",2,1518825661,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7y32kb/quick_lesson_error_catastrophe_vs_extinction/

But this week, boy, this week was special.

A go-to argument for the common descent of man and chimpansee is the fused human chromosome 2 which I duly point out.

- Ah, but how do you know it is fused?

Well, there are two fused telomeres in the middle and two centromeres about halfway each.

- So how do you know the human chromosome wasn't the original and it has split into two parts in the chimp?

... Because telomeres are end code and two pieces of end code stuck together points at a fusion, not a split.

- But maybe in that human chromosome, the centromere just looks like two fused telomeres.

No.

- Can you prove that chimp chromosomes can fuse?

I can prove chromosomes can and do fuse all the time, about 1 in 1000 humans have extra fused chromosomes in their DNA.

- But specifically chimp chromosomes, in a lab, repeatedly tested with the same result.

There is no reason to even think chimp chromosomes are somehow special in that they wouldn't fuse.

- So you can't prove that?

At this point I'm getting a little ticked off, and say the following:
It wouldn't matter even if I could show you the research paper, since it wasn't the chimp chromosome that fused but the chromosome of out common ancestor and you'll undoubtedly use that as an 'out'

Him: correct.

DebateEvolution,7xnjgh,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,mtEve Was Not 6000 Years Ago,"This may be the single most common *specific* creationist talking point that I hear and read. mtEve, the most recent common ancestor of all human mitochondrial DNA, existed 6000 years ago. This number was arrived upon by calculating a mutation rate for the mitochondrial genome, surveying human mtDNA diversity, and doing the arithmetic to determine how long it would take for that diversity to accumulate if we started from a single genome. You’ll sometimes hear creationists discussing this work call the mutation rate used the “calculated” mtDNA mutation rate, as opposed to the supposedly less-reliable “inferred” rate.

&amp;nbsp;

This type of analysis – survey diversity, determine rate of change, calculate back to the common ancestor – is called coalescence analysis. The way this works is pretty simple. Say you have two cells, and there are ten differences in their DNA. At some point, they shared a common ancestor, and since that time, each lineage leading to your two cells has experienced five mutations. If we can calculate how long it takes for a mutation to happen in these cells e.g. one mutation per generation, we can calculate how long since the most recent common ancestor. Using a rate of one mutation/generation, that would be five generations. We then just multiply five generations by the time for a single generation to calculate the time to most recent common ancestor, or TMRCA. 

Pretty simple, right?

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s look at a second example, this time in two multicellular animals. This is harder, because they’re each going to experience many more mutations per generation than will get passed on. So let’s say we again have ten differences, but this time, we see that while each individual experiences five mutations per generation. Woah! They’re siblings, right? Five plus five if you go back a single generation gets you to their MRCA (their parent, in this case). But here’s the thing: No every animal cell is involved in reproduction. Only *germ line cells* are involved in making gametes – sperm and egg – so only mutations in the germ line can be passed on. All the rest of the cells, *somatic cells*, are not involved in reproduction, so any mutation there don’t get passed on.

So for coalescence analysis in multicellular things, we need to distinguish between the *mutation rate*, that rate at which changes occur, and the *substitution rate*, the rate at which changes *accumulate* from generation to generation. 

Going back to our hypothetical animals, we have a mutation rate of five mutations/generation, but (let’s say) a substitution rate of just one substitution (fixed mutation) per generation. Which means our two animals share a common ancestor not one generation in the past, but five, just like the cells in our first case. 

Still pretty simple, right? You just have to use the substitution rate rather than the mutation rate. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s get back to the mtMRCA. 

The creation-friendly age of about 6kya (thousand years ago) for the mtMRCA was calculated by Dr. Nathanial Jeanson. He used data from a pedigree study (i.e. comparing parents and children) to calculate a mutation rate the human mtDNA, and then used that mutation rate to determine how long it would take to accumulate the differences we see in the two most different peoples’ mtDNA. 

The problem is this: Jeanson counted *all* of the differences found between parents and offspring in this study. If the parents and children were different, that counted as a mutation that contributed to the per-generation mutation rate Jeanson calculated. 

&amp;nbsp;

Let me use [this illustration]( https://i.imgur.com/gkbXf9j.png) to show the problem here, and let’s say each arrow represents a single mutation. 

Looking at the whole figure, you can see a substitution rate of one substitution per generation. We can also see an overall mutation rate of four mutations per generation (three somatic, one germline). 

Now just looking at the grandparent-to-parent generation, we can see a single arrow representing that one substitution per generation, and three somatic mutations in each. So if we surveyed those two individuals, we’d find seven differences (three somatic mutations in each, plus the germline mutation in the parent generation. 

By Jeanson’s math, that’s seven mutations per generation, so if we find 140 differences between two individuals, or 70 per lineage since they diverged, that’s ten generations. 

&amp;nbsp;

That’s how Jeanson arrived at the rate he did, and the error should be clear. It’s not *seven mutations* per generation in our example here, but *one substitution*, since only a single new mutation is inherited from generation to generation. In other words, only one new mutation accumulates per generation. Using the same numbers as above, our two individuals with 140 differences are separated not by ten generations, but by *70*, an enormous difference. In human terms, this is the difference between a MRCA 200 years ago, and *1,400* (using a 20-year generation time).

&amp;nbsp;

So how do we deal with this problem? How can we tell what differences count as substitutions, and which are merely somatic mutations? 

The way to do it is to *not use data from a pedigree study*. Instead, we have to track differences across much longer timeframes, since over thousands of generations, the substitutions will vastly outnumber somatic mutations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Take for example my simple figure from above. Three somatic mutations and one new substitution per generation. Across, say, three generations, it’s 50/50 substitutions vs. mutations that explain the differences you see. But across three *hundred* generations, that’d be three hundred substitutions to just three somatic mutations, meaning the somatic mutations would have only a negligible (and, usefully, predictable) impact on the calculated substitution rate.  

So instead of looking at parents and children, survey from divergent groups with known TMRCAs. For example, the initial settlement of Pacific islands, or the resettlement of Europe after the last ice age. Known dates. Determine what the maximum number of differences are, and use *that* number to determine the per generation substitution rate. This is how we arrive at the “inferred” rate I referenced above, the one that is supposedly less accurate than the “observed” or “measured” rate Jeanson calculated.

So you get the substitution rate, and then you survey the most divergent populations possible (e.g. African, Pacific Islander, and Native American), determine the maximum number of differences, and used your empirically determined substitution rate to calculate the TMRCA for all of these groups, which is the TMRCA for human mtDNA, or mtEve. 

Using these *correct* techniques, we get a substitution rate 30-something times slower than the mutation rate Jeanson calculated, corresponding to a TMRCA in the neighborhood of [200kya](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694979/), not 6kya. 

&amp;nbsp;

Did that seem…not all that complicated? Good. It isn’t. It really pretty straightforward.

**""**Mutations are rare and good ones are even more rare. One reason mutations are rare is because there are sophisticated error correction mechanisms in our cells. So according to evolution random mutations created correction mechanisms to suppress random mutations. And that paradox is only the beginning. Because error correction mechanisms, as with pretty much everything else in biology, require many, many mutations to be created. If one mutation is rare, a lot of mutations are astronomically rare. For instance, if a particular mutation has a one-in-a-million (one in 10^6) chance of occurring in a new individual, then a hundred such particular mutations have a one in **10^600 chance of occurring**.

Evolutionists seem to think it is unreasonable to demand that a detailed mutation-by-mutation path through protein space be provided, *even once*. I claim that a pathway like this has never been described, for protein space or any similarly-populated address space, and indeed such paths do not in general exist. Show me I'm wrong.

As I have pointed out before, evolutionists have turned to English text to illustrate their genetic concepts on several occasions. John Maynard Smith used his well-known WORD =&gt; WORE =&gt; GORE =&gt; GONE =&gt; GENE mutation pathway to demonstrate that a wholly different word can be derived by point mutations (but this doesn't work for sentences, or even long words). Richard Dawkins used his controversial ""METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL"" to demonstrate something, I don't know what. So I suggest that we use text to demonstrate that it is (im)possible to mutate through a text space analogous to protein space. So, here's my challenge:

Start out with a sentence of your own choosing. This analogizes the first living cell. Then, mutate that sentence into a 300-page book, utilizing statistically probable single-letter mutations (additions, deletions or alterations), or word/sentence/page/chapter duplications/reversals/deletions/translocations etc. Every mutation step must result in a new composition that utilizes proper spelling, punctuation and grammar, and must convey a cogent and interesting theme (to analogize competition for survival).

If you don't like my analogy, explain why it is not applicable, and suggest an analogy you find more appropriate.

DebateEvolution,7wq4po,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,Question,"Creationists, can you define ""information""?","This is a specific response to users /u/no-karma-ii, and /u/semitope, and any other creationists who have used the argument ""mutations can't increase genetic information"", or some variant.

What I am looking for, and what you should also be looking for if you wish to have scientific integrity, is a concise definition of information. This definition should address all of the following points:

* Is information objectively quantifiable, and if so how? By objective I mean at no point should a subjective decision be required. Creationists have often said information is quantity dependent on the ""purpose"" or ""intent"" of the genetic information. I believe this is a subjective claim. If you involve metrics in your definition that I believe are subjective, I will ask you to objectively define them.

* If information is not objectively quantifiable, can you still justify placing such an importance on it in creationist arguments?

* Is new information and increased information the same thing? Creationists often use the two interchangeably, despite ""new"" and ""Increase"" having very different definitions.

* Is information, or our detection of information, scalable? Richard Dawkins was asked for a mutation that increased information. This implies that information increases are detectable on the most minute level possible in genetics.

* Are there any additional considerations that need to be made when assessing information, and its relation to the argument that it cannot increase? For example, some creationists say that information can increase in small quantities, but not at the quantities evolution requires. In which case, do any of these additional considerations also have objective criteria?

Note, that I am NOT looking for examples of what is or is not information. You may use them to illustrate your points, if you wish. But it will not count as a proper definition of information unless the above five dot points are addressed. Creationists usually have an idea of things that do and don't count as information, but I don't believe these have objective criteria. Rather, they are arbitrarily defined that way according to the creationist presupposition: Anything we've observed form naturally is not information, any extant life is information.

I don't actually believe anyone will be able to provide a definition. I don't believe there is any objective, mathematical metric that would directly correlate with both the complexity, and the quality of life on Earth. If you agree, and your answer to the first dot point is a direct ""no"", then you can feel free to only address the first two dot points, and disregard the rest.",115,1518316208,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7wq4po/creationists_can_you_define_information/

DebateEvolution,7wbzu1,preferpaleo,Former Creationist,,self.DebateEvolution,Link,"Can I get a rebuttal to a rebbuttal of a rebuttal (Creationwiki, again)","So I have been writing up some responses to creationwiki's critiques of talk.origins. I have come across this response I was wondering if I could your guy's responses to this. Recently my understanding of the defintion of transtional fossil has been clouded by misinformation spread by creationists. This creationwiki [response] (http://creationwiki.org/Transitional_fossils_are_lacking_(Talk.Origins) has to do with the defintion of transtional and due to my clouded understanding I wish to hear what you all have to say regarding this response.


The specific part I would like a repsonse to is this:


This is what talk.origins was responding to: There are no transitional fossils. Evolution predicts a continuum between each fossil organism and its ancestors. Instead, we see systematic gaps in the fossil record.


Talk.origns says this: ""There are many transitional fossils. The only way that the claim of their absence may be remotely justified, aside from ignoring the evidence completely, is to redefine ""transitional"" as referring to a fossil that is a direct ancestor of one organism and a direct descendant of another. However, direct lineages are not required; they could not be verified even if found. What a transitional fossil is, in keeping with what the theory of evolution predicts, is a fossil that shows a mosaic of features from an older and more recent organism.""


Creationwiki responds to talk.origins by saying: ""The problem here is the use of the word ""transitional"", the adjectival form of ""transition"" transition: Passage from one form, state, style, or place to another. Transitional fossil definition on the free online dictionary The use of the word ""transitional"" implies an ancestor / descendant relationship. If evolutionists do not mean it that way, then it is they that are redefining ""transitional"". Certainly when the average person hears the term ""transitional form"" they think ancestor / descendant, not simply a mosaic of different types. It also implies individual body parts in transition from one to the other. It seems that evolutionists are playing word games that make evolution theory seem stronger than it really is. When the non-scientific layman hears that fossil B is ""transitional between"" A and C, he thinks it means A-B-C, but evolutionists may mean: this: Evotree1.gif this: Evotree2.gif this: Evotree3.gif this: Evotree4.gif (You have to click on the [response] (http://creationwiki.org/Transitional_fossils_are_lacking_(Talk.Origins) to see these diagrams
or any number of other possible combinations. Usually when a Creationist says there are no transitional fossils they are talking to layman in layman terms, not evolutionist technical terms. While a field of study is free to define its internal terms as its practitioners see fit, when they use a common term in different way, they are obligated to distinguish between the technical and common uses of the term, but in this case it is seldom done. The use of the word ""transitional"" is also loaded with evolutionary presupposition. A more appropriate term would be a ""mosaic fossil"". If one assumes the common ancestor postulated evolution, then these mosaic fossils would show how different types are related even if they are out of sequence and/or not mosaic in other ways. However, when looked at from a more skeptical viewpoint, they often do not show any clear evidence of an actual transition. Sometimes the data is complete enough to make a good case that the animals are indeed related, but at other times it is not. However, evolution requires that one type of living thing evolved into another type, via intermediates that would be transitional (in the normal meaning of the word) between the two types, and we should expect to find evidence of these amongst the fossil record. By claiming that there are ""transitional"" forms, but that these are not ""transitional"" in the normal understanding of the word, Talk.Origins has tacitly admitted that there are no such fossils, just as creationists claim!""

Yet that's not really what we claim. When evidence for another mechanism, such as viral insertion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus), becomes sufficient its accepted into the evolutionary synthesis. As of right now mutation, selection, gene flow (movement between populations/plasmid exchange by bacteria), genetic drift (random loss of alleles) and viral insertion are all accepted mechanisms. I may have missed some obscure ones, and new ones occasionally are discovered.

Intelligent design proponents are making a specific, testable claim for the insertion of another (sixth) mechanism into that list. We know what intelligent design looks like, because we've done it ourselves. If you show me an instance of an organism gaining a sequence of DNA over one generation that isn't a copy of its existing genes, and doesn't look like a virus that infects said organism, I'll take that as strong evidence of a designer. That's not what we see in nature. Genes look like modified copies of each other, or of non-coding sequences or of viral sequences. That is what we see when humans genetically modify something by inserting DNA from a different organism.

You can't prove a negative. Maybe every species out there evolved except one species of sparrow, to whose genome the creator decided to add ""Xenu was here"" about three years ago. the burden of proof here is on the proponent of intelligent design, to find that hypothetical sparrow.

&gt; [An argument I find particularly embarrassing is when someone says ""Of course you get the wrong age, C14 dating is the wrong method for old things."" It's as if my tour guide says ""there's no elephants within miles,"" as I reach out and poke one with my yardstick. ""You fool,"" the guide retorts, ""every cartographer knows you can't measure miles with a yardstick.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7uship/questions_about_radiometric_dating/dtmy9u3/)

The analogy fails completely on the simple fact that JohnBerea is saying that if we can't measure the length of something, then it must not exist. And that's not what radiometric dating does.

The better analogy is trying to figure out how many miles away an elephant is from you, if the shortest measuring stick that you have is a mile-stick, and its minimum measurement is 1/16th of a mile. If that elephant is only a yard away from 0, then, according to that measuring stick, that elephant is 0 miles away.

The measurement doesn't say something doesn't exist, or has no age. If it's too young or too old for the measurement, then the measurement will always be off.

The only one who should be embarrassed at such a weak analogy is JohnBerea.",184,1517636284,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7uxjkr/ujohnberea_an_argument_i_find_particularly/
DebateEvolution,7uva5s,Jattok,,,self.DebateEvolution,Discussion,"/r/Creation: ""Liars for Darwin"", or How to lie about why you lost your moderation powers","Our former, ridiculously abusive and dense YEC moderator, [has posted a complaint](https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7urhis/liars_for_darwin/) of ""some of these common fallacies that a lot of evolutionist (on r/debateevolution or otherwise) use which are all incredibly dishonest and deserve to be called out."" Unfortunately, it turns out to be a complete whine fest, where /u/Br56u7 shows how little self-awareness he has, and lacks all understanding of what he's talking about. These, along with his abusiveness, are why this subreddit turned on him within one week of him getting his powers.

&gt; Imposing your truth as the objective truth and seeing it as so true, that anyone who disagrees must be a liar or dishonest. Not seeing how someone can disagree with you is just a bad habit and this is all rooted in an incredible argument from incredulity.""I can't possibly see how someone disagrees!""

He lists no examples for any of his complaints, so there's no way to check whether his point has any merit. But he was called a liar because he would make a statement, then change either what he said, someone else said, or double down on the original statement knowing that it was already wrong. We know why he disagreed with us, and that's because he honestly thinks his creationist beliefs are true. He acts like anything which opposes those beliefs are from people who refuse to acknowledge the truth. It's almost a sickness how far he goes to deny that he's ever wrong.

&gt; Accusations of quote mining by suggesting that we're implying something we never suggested. In the confines of creationism/evolution, this goes along the lines of creationist going ""see, here look at this quote from this evolutionist/uniformitarian. He agrees and sees the same facts that we do yet concludes something different."" Then evolutionist,""QUOTE MINE! That person isn't a creationist at all and doesn't agree with you on this at all!"" Then creationist,""We never said he agreed with creationism, just that he saw the same facts as we do. We never implied what you think we implied."" This is almost always how this goes and evolutionist often ignore this (clear) fallacy and accuse YEC's of quote mining non stop which is dishonest. You end up rupturing and trying to block any trust that could exist between creationist and the general public, and this is a dishonest way of doing that.

The accusations I saw against /u/Br56u7 were because he kept quoting only part of a definition or part of a post elsewhere, and insisted that his partial quote was all that there was. He refused to accept that the parts he left out change his argument and invalidate it.

He's gone so far as to change what the complaints about quote mining are against him, which itself is a straw man fallacy.

&gt; Equivocating being wrong with lying. The definition of lying is telling a falsehood you know or believe to be wrong to someone. Evolutionist do this all the time at debateevolution and this is dishonest. This is because your now putting it in peoples minds that we're somehow evil and attaching morality to something can obscure objective reasoning. When your taught ""this position is wrong"", That's one thing but then going around and saying ""this position is wrong and evil and so are the people advocating for it"" then no matter how good the logic that position may have, people will avoid it because they think its evil.

Here, the problem with /u/Br56u7's claim is that when people did explain how he was wrong, he continued being wrong. That's how you get accused of lying. When you know something is wrong, people show you how that something is wrong, but continue saying it anyways.

&gt; The adhoms and ridicule. This really doesn't need much explanation, but this is dishonest because it enforces a ""peer pressure"" mindset when it comes to such things. I've seen many Christians in Scandinavia or europe be worried about telling people their beliefs or even believing in christianity because everyone else doesn't and is mocked if they do. This same logic is applied to creationism and this really obscures objective reasoning.

The ad hominems weren't ad hominems. Simply calling someone a mean name isn't an ad hominem at all. This is something too many creationists assume, and they will use this deflection to ignore the rest of a point someone's made. Here, /u/Br56u7 is using it again to ignore what happened to him.

The ridicule was justified. He made it clear that his intention was to ban people he wanted to ban. One of the first things he did was expand the definition of Rule 1 so almost anything could be considered violating this rule, and then inserted a 3-strikes policy to it. No other rule had this change to it. And it was only Rule 1 that he kept hammering on thread after thread.

When he began inserting himself into posts and warned people of Rule 1, he got backlash immediately. He was misinterpreting tone and direction of posts, and he never apologized for his overbearing moderation. He then went fully obnoxious, and started to remove posts because he inferred tone and arguments that weren't there. It was so bad that he would even lie about what someone said, and his lie would be exposed because another moderator would overrule his removal of the post and the original would be visible again.

He wasn't mocked for his beliefs; he was ridiculed because he was a slimy, dishonest creationist trying to punish non-creationists by abusing his powers.

&gt; Not wanting to debate equals HAHA YOU LOST! No, if you constantly were getting pulled in to debates were the opponent threw adhoms and commited all the above fallacies, you would probably never would want to debate them again and you'd probably ignore them. Yet, I see users doing this all the time which Is why I have to mention this here. This is equivalent to someone throwing pigeon shit at you while playing checkers and then crying victory when you don't want to play checkers with them.

The analogy is playing checkers with a pigeon, who shits on the board, knocks over pieces, and flies away claiming victory. That's exactly what /u/Br56u7 is doing here. He got caught lying about what happened to him here, and instead of apologizing for lying, he continued ramping up his victimhood. He claimed that he was banned from here, but all that happened was that he lost his moderation powers. He then claimed that it was a coup d'etat, but he was never in power more than one of several moderators who were added. No one else took his place, so there was no transfer of power.

His post-demotion whinefest just illustrated how little respect he has for the truth. And in any debate, when you resort to lying, then you did lose.

&gt; gish galloping by derailing the argument from its original topic to discuss an entirely unrelated topic that they know takes a ton of time and effort and will result in long and complex debates that a creationist isn't necessarily trying to get into. The creationist is simply trying to stay on topic and the evolutionist is trying to distract. This results in the evolutionist accusing the creationist/ID of avoiding it because he ""knows"" that he doesn't have an argument. Ex.""UCM is not a fact because x.""""UCM is a fact because Y, but creationism is fiction and not fact and has no evidence for it"""" Y is wrong because of Z""""You know creationism has no evidence so you don't answer."" Don't get me wrong, if the topic warrants it, Ill gladly give evidence and talk about 6k mtEve, water gaps, escarpments, cratonic sequences, submarine canyons, bioturbation etc. But if we're talking about a relatively simple topic like IC, I'm not going off a tangent and discussing an unrelated topic. In specifically sticking to IC.

I have no idea what he's bringing up here. The thread that included his claims about UCM not being a fact didn't have anything to do with creationism was wrong.

Here's the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/dtfmzi7/

No one brought up creationism there. What did happen was that /u/Br56u7 kept trying to tell scientists that he knew what a scientific fact was, and that they did not. He was arguing that known scientific facts simply weren't because of his interpretation of what a fact was. This was further evidence that he would be a terrible moderator, if he would argue that he understood science better than the scientists here.

He finishes with two quotes from the Bible, which further illustrate how little self-awareness that he has.

&gt; ""If a wise person has an argument with a fool, there will be ranting and ridicule but no satisfaction."" Proverbs 29:9

&gt; ""Do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words."" Proverbs 23:9

For /r/creation, this is another example of how much of a safe space that subreddit is. Here, someone who wanted to turn this place into a safe space for creationists got a heavy dose of reality that he was abusing his powers and didn't know what the fuck he was talking about, so he ran back to where he could lie with impunity and have little, if any, criticism for his lies.

/u/Br56u7 refused to learn from his mistakes. And this is the most damning thing about why it was a terrible idea to give him any power over others.",78,1517611872,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7uva5s/rcreation_liars_for_darwin_or_how_to_lie_about/

Here is /u/stcordova's comment on the ""747 Junkyard"" argument being now in [the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/):

&gt; Actually most observed natural selection in the lab and field is destructive not constructive. To extend that awful dice analogy the right way, selection would prevent getting 10 sixes in a row EVEN LESS than random chance. We call that the problem of fitness peaks and reductive evolution, but such correct arguments are outlawed and now at r/debateevolution. In the world of r/debateevolution you must believe and recite what is false to be accepted just like saying the emperor has clothes when he has none.


When asked to source this, this was /u/stcordova's response:

&gt; Jerry Coyne (an evolutionary biologist) **acknowledge Behe's article on lab observations was by and large correct**. Coyne goes on to say Behe was wrong about evolution however because natural selection happens differently in Coyne's imagination (not actual experiments or field observations, lol).

&gt; See:
https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/behes-new-paper/

&gt; Also google ""reductive evolution"".

&gt; And this describes how selection may cause such specialization that a little environmental perturbation results in extinction, **hence selection is an agent of destruction, not construction**:

&gt; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bij.12843/abstract

&amp;nbsp;

Also, we got our ex-YEC /u/Br56u7 posting this:

&amp;nbsp;

An old friend /u/nomenmeum also says this about the ""747 Junkyard"" argument:

&gt; Of course, under those conditions.  This analogy exactly copies all of the fatal errors of Dawkins's ""Methinks it is like a weasel"" analogy: **It makes the outcome not only probable but inevitable, makes selection targeted for a specific outcome, and requires generation after generation of dysfunctional organisms to survive and replicate.**  [I made a post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7nfwif/new_years_cage_match_sanford_vs_dawkins/) not long ago if anyone is interested.

DebateEvolution,7ue53v,Dzugavili,,,self.DebateEvolution,,A Week Of Creationist Modding: Post-Mortem,"/u/Br56u7 has been removed as moderator.

Well, that was interesting, wasn't it?

His behaviour was strongly anatagonistic: the ""observed fact"" discussion comes to mind as one that is particularly grating. At this point, I feel the community won't accept him as a creationist moderator, mostly due to his rejection of some key aspects to science. Every attempt I made to soften his stances was met with rejection: we have some very, very long discussions on modmail in which logic seems to go out the window, but I may make a post about it, as I found a few points on genetic entropy that I figure might be worth discussing.

But I digress: what the goal of the creationist moderator experiment, and why do I think it is now unattainable?

# What was the experiment?

The experiment was intended to test whether a creationist moderator, particularly a hard creationist moderator, was capable of influencing discussion in a positive fashion.

The experiment was initially prompted by /u/Br56u7 in a challenge in /r/creation. Despite being rather sure myself that he would make a terrible candidate, I opted to place the architect into a central position, as I figured he would have the best motivation to perform well in the experiment. I took on one of the other applicants, and an evolutionist moderator to act as his foils. Essentially, I would moderator the moderators.

At that point, I was rather hands-off and generally supportive. I allowed all forces in the experiment to operate more or less free of influence, though I had to take the reins at a few moments in order to prevent the experiment from spinning out.

The goal of the experiment was to determine the effects of a creationist moderator and whether they can act objectively when they treat science irrationally -- and more importantly, can they operate within the standard ruleset of a real society, rather than a location where they have to be coddled.

# Termination Condition

Unfortunately, community pressure reached a peak. I expected that within a few days, he would soften a bit and understand that he can't be at war with the community. However, it seems he is repeating the same discussions on a daily basis and this obsession is troubling.

Given particular statements from the community, I think it's best that we end the experiment now.

# Observations

##Hostage taking

At more than one occasion, /u/Br56u7 and /u/RibosomalTransferRNA threatened to resign. In each case, I would apply a moderating influence and then more or less do nothing.

In particularly, I note the following message from /u/Br56u7, regarding the inclusion of genetic entropy and the Junkyard 747 on my Rule #7:

&gt;As I've feared, this expansion of rule 7 has been taken advantage of to censor actual debates and arguments. This is why, if I don't see that argument removed from that thread in 24 hours I'm leaving the subreddit. I've been fine dealing with all the other crap, but this is the limit. If you don't delete, I'm simply going and Ill satisfy the fantasies of every user on this subreddit. I'm not going to stand here and see these 2 perfectly legitimate arguments get banned because people don't like them, and if I'm gone don't bother to tag me on this subreddit again.

That was two days ago, during which time I only further expanded my entries on genetic entropy. So, it was rather clear his threat was empty. I don't know whether my arguments were getting through to him.

We have been discussing the failings of Sanford's Genetic Entropy model for the past two days through modmail, as I explain why I'm including it, but I suppose that discussion is likely over. He's welcome to make a thread on the subject, with the understanding that all I'm going to do is shit on Sanford's model, his failed prediction and the lack of any physical evidence.

Once again, I digress: 

## Unusually high aggression

Boy, did you guys go after him quick. And boy, does he not know when to back off.

Pretty much from the get-go, he attempted to implement strong safe-space policies. He never took my suggestion to try soft methods, pretty much always just flashed the posts and kept arguing. This made him a strong target, as he overmoderated.

Part of moderating a debate forum is to not shut down discussion -- this means I usually only moderate the posts strongly and leave the comments to sort themselves out. This usually operates fine. Unfortunately, he took to the position of arguing every position, when power is best leveled in vague and otherwise indifferent threats.

Rather than trying to police aggression only made to our guests, which is the more proper method, he took every slight against any creationist, even shadowpuppets, trolls and vague 'theys', as being a hostile. He had a really low bar. This only led to a further piling on.

# Conclusion and Predictions

/r/creation will shortly lose their shit and ignore that antagonism had reached a critical level where I'd remove any moderator, atheist, creationist or otherwise if the community reacted this strongly.

/u/Br56u7 will probably play the martyr. He'll probably double-down on the subject we were discussing.

This is, of course, from CMI, so we can be sure right off the bat that it will be either dishonest, false, or both, given the track record of papers from that organization.  I figured I'd try my hand at showing how poorly both the author of the article, and the individual who posted it to those who share his belief in fiction ([defined by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) as ""the classification for any story or setting that is derived from imagination—**in other words, not based strictly on history or *fact*.**""), understand the topics at hand.  

* Mountains

The article claims that the origins of mountains is unknown, while at the same time linking to a book that shows how mountains came to be.  Well, suppose that this doesn't meet his skewed definition of ""fact"" for the moment, because the book didn't witness it or somesuch.  Howsabout we look at the Cascade mountains.  These mountains are at the edge of an oceanic and continental plate, with the oceanic plate subducting under the continental one, causing the mountain range to rise.  How do we know that this is actually happening?  Well, because we've observed it happening, and we've measured it - the oceanic plates are subducting there about 3-4 cm per year.  We have confirmed that there is material from the oceanic crust beneath the mountain range, as well as tholeiitic basalt ophiolites from the mid-oceanic ridge present in the tops of the mountains in that range.  However, for the most compelling evidence, I think, we need to go to the Carbet Mountains on the island of Martinique in the Carribean.  A [study done in 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/26/7082) showed that the lava from the volcanoes that formed these mountain masses, which was originally formed in the mantle, also contain a magnesium signature unique to oceanic crustal materials in the area, confirming that it came from oceanic crustal material joining with mantle material beneath the volcanoes, just above the subduction zone.

* Planation surfaces

The article claims they're difficult to explain...  What, the author couldn't go to the [wiki page on Mesas?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa#Formation)

* Inselbergs

The article claims they're difficult to explain...  What, the author couldn't go to the [wiki page on Inselbergs?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inselberg#Geology)

* Pediments

The article makes the claim that because we don't see them being formed today, then we have to throw uniformitarianism out the window.  That's like saying that because the bakery isn't making croissants today, we have to discard all of baking.  Sure, it's not known precisely what conditions cause the formation of pediments, but if we don't know what causes them, how can he say that they aren't being caused?

* Hard rounded rocks transported long distances 

Now we're discussing the shape and origins of some of the rocks found on the pediments from earlier, and we see the author assuming his Young Earth conclusions: 

&gt; ""Some of the rounded rocks were transported long distances, more than 1,000 km from their sources, which is impossible to explain by the relatively weak size and power of today’s streams and rivers—even by local floods.""

Just today's streams and rivers...  but we're just going to ignore billions of years of other streams and rivers because they don't fit your preferred narrative.

* Gorges and water gaps

Ah, the classic ""water would have had to flow uphill to cut the Grand Canyon"" nonsense.  This is where the author's willful dishonesty comes to the fore, because it isn't like this hasn't been debunked a zillion times before by people who actually make it their business to study this.  I'll let [potholer54 cover the explanation for this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wa_ey3jGPs&amp;t=3m32s).

* Submarine geomorphology

Again, the answer to how continental shelves were formed [is but a google search away](http://marinebio.org/oceans/continental-shelves/).  The same could be said of the formation of oceanic trenches, but there's several formational mechanisms depending on what trench and where, so I'll just spell it out in two words: *plate tectonics*.

Finale: Flood Baloney!

&gt; The majority of the erosion and deposition of the Earth’s surface took place during the runoff of the Flood water, when the mountains and continents rose and the ocean basins sank.

From the bibliography, it seems that he's using a model that involves the ""waters from the deep"" and assumes that everything afterwards will conveniently stratify into nice tidy layers, precisely as has never been seen from any flood ever.  Let's ignore the problems of post-flood and examine the problems of the flood itself, using water from such a source.

The main issue is that the ambient temperature of rock from even a mile underground is above the boiling point of water... well above.  Any ""water from the deep"" would be released in the form of steam.  When 1 gram of steam condenses to 1 gram of liquid water at 20 degrees Celsius, it releases 2454 joules of energy. 1 m^3 of water is 1,000,000 grams. The surface of the Earth is 510,072,000 km^2 or 510,072,000,000,000 m^2 (or, more scientifically written: 5.10*10^14 m^2 )

Thus, if we drop a measly meter of water a day at an average temperature of 20 C (68 F), the amount of energy released is:

2454 joules/g * 1,000,000 g/m^3 * 5.10*10^14 m^3 per day = 1.25 * 10^24 joules per day. That is 2.991 * 10^8 megatonnes/day; more than 14 billion nuclear bombs as powerful as those dropped on Nagasaki. Now consider we're doing this every day, for forty days. The Pentagon would envy such an arsenal.

Put another way, for every m of water level increase, we have to release 2.454 billion joules/m^2 . At a rate of 1 m/day, this comes to 2.454 billion joules/day/m^2 or a radiance of 28.4 kilowatts/m^2 - roughly 21 times the brightness of the sun! Result: The atmosphere rapidly turns into incandescent plasma incinerating Noah, Ark, animals, and all. Nothing survives, the oceans boil and the land is baked into pottery... and this wouldn't even be enough water to cover the highest mountains, as described in the Bible.

The rest of the proposed explanation as to how a global flood would explain all these things for which we already have an explanation is a bunch of handwaving and unsupported assertions, and ultimately meaningless given that any water from the source used in their model wouldn't be liquid water, but rather, a blast wave of steam, quickly circling and sterilizing the planet.

Anyway, to get to the point as to **why this thread is important**:

Our new YEC mod apparently wants way more than to just make everything more civil (which I'm also agreeing to) but he also wants to have a say in other things. Most notable, **what does and doesn't belong into the ""Bad Arguments"" category in the sidebar**.

If we want him to do that, we need to clarify things. Actually, I would say it's more like we have to *teach* him these definitions. I hope he is willing to endure a whole thread dedicated to him, that is why I will enforce civility and objectivity way more than I would in any other thread. Keep it calm, focus on the argument. 

Let's go.

&amp;nbsp;

**SCIENTIFIC FACT**

&gt; A fact is a statement that is true or can be proven with evidence. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means).

&gt; In science, a fact is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called empirical evidence.

&gt; In the most basic sense, a scientific fact is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a hypothesis or theory, which is intended to explain or interpret facts.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact#In_science)

/u/Br56u7 seems to disagree that certain established scientific facts are indeed, facts:

&gt;&gt; ""In science, a fact is a repeatable careful observation or measurement""

&gt; Universal common ancestry is neither of these, because we did not observe all life evolving from a common ancestor. Don't equivocate being supported by the observable with being observable and I'm not making this definition up. Just look on the Wikepiedia link I've provided, and youll find the exact words.

&gt; If it isn't a verified observation, it isn't a fact. Is there a 99.9% chance that Pluto will orbit the sun and make a roundtrip? Yes. Is it a verified observation? No. So its not a fact.


**OBSERVABILITY**

Observable, people ask? After saying that, the discussion changes to the topic of what observable is. /u//u/Br56u7 says:

&gt; As I've said, a scientific fact has to be an observed phenomena. Most people try to equivocate having support from the observable with being observable, which merely isn't the case. If having proof from the observable makes a theory/hypothesis a scientific fact, then opposing theories could be labelled as facts simultaneously from the definition of a scientific fact, which I'll repeat
scientific fact is an objective and verifiable observation

&gt; I did mean observed in the broad sense of all 5 senses to. Most people when arguing about what is a scientific fact, pick the definitions to have qualms about rather than my use of it. We have observed Pluto with all 5 senses orbiting the sun, if we hadn't till now then it wouldn't be a scientific fact. **If your disagreement is over what a scientific fact is, then too bad.**

&amp;nbsp;

They have a new piece up on the complexity of early life, but start with a series of Darwin quotes, to show how *committed* he was to gradualism:

&gt;I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of ‘Natura non facit saltum.’ We meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so? (p. 194)

&gt;On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, ‘Natura non facit saltum.’ This canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my theory be strictly true. (p. 206)

&gt;The canon of ‘Natura non facit saltum’ applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs. (p. 210)

&gt;The canon in natural history, of ‘natura non facit saltum’ is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise inexplicable, — all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection. (p. 243)

&gt;As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of ‘Natura non facit saltum’ which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man can explain. (p. 471)

Where are all these from?

&gt;Here are representative quotes from Origin, **1st edition**, making clear how important this doctrine was to Darwin

Emphasis mine. Because Darwin *changed his mind* due to later findings. Here are his revised thoughts, from the 5th edition, 1869:

&gt;“The periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.”

&amp;nbsp;

The rest of the piece is devoid of content. Things are complex! Evolution is complicated! Yup. Wait to you actually know what you're talking about. It's *bonkers*. 

Is there a conclusion? Therefore...something? No. Just a series of Darwin quote-mines (and yes, this is quote-mining, since it's misrepresenting Darwin's position) and some life-is-complex-therefore-something-evolution word salad.

# BAD CREATIONIST ARGUMENTS

## THERMODYNAMICS

Example: Thermodynamics says everything trends towards chaos, so complex life could never evolve. Thermodynamics says that entropy is always increasing.

Counter: Thermodynamics refers to [closed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_system#Closed_system), and the Earth isn't a closed system. We receive energy from our star, which drives thermodynamics on Earth against the thermodynamic gradient, though there are other sources of energy closer to home, such as geothermal sources

Entropy isn't constantly increasing: local drops in entropy are fairly common, such as cooling water in your fridge. However, you had to get the power from somewhere else.

There is also the concept of the [vacuum state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state) and [quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation), in which quantum events drive the system against entropy: to put simply, sometimes there is no way but up. These events require specific conditions and produce very unusual conditions, such as [superfluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity), that don't really make sense to us in a normal everyday world.

Why It's Bad: It's made by people who don't really understand thermodynamics.

## INFORMATION THEORY

Example: Information theory says intelligent information has to come from somewhere, so something intelligent must have generated the genome.

Counter: [Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) says nothing of the sort -- mostly because it's abstract mathematics, mostly dealing with things like encryption or file compression. The physics definitions of information, in which information is conserved, operates on [a far lower level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science) than genetic information, which is primarily chemical interactions. It can be used to describe conservation of energy and the results of that in quantum operations, but the applications of information theory isn't particularly meaningful to genetics outside of the statistical modelling.

Why It's Bad: Information has specific meanings in different fields of study. In the microchemical level that DNA is on, information is the physical properties of particles and chemicals, and that information is rearranged to become life -- there's no violation of information theory, since we didn't need any physical information that wasn't already here. Furthermore, information theory doesn't really mention intelligences, just how much information can be encoded and decoded from various sources -- it'll readily allow for random sources.

## 'EVOLUTION IS JUST A THEORY' or 'A THEORY ISN'T A LAW'

Example: Evolution is just a theory, it isn't proven. It's not a law.

Counter: [Scientific theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) is not a guess, it's a repeatable, evidence-based model for prediction, one that models reality with reasonable-to-strong accuracy and usually our best model; and [scientific law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law) defines relationships strictly, usually in mathematical terms. Gravity is, after all, just a theory -- but you don't see anyone shouting to teach the controversy.

Why It's Bad: If you don't even know what a theory is, you're not ready for this.

## Y-ADAM and MITOCHONDRIAL-EVE

Example: The existence of Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam show that all humans descend from a single pair of individuals.

Counter: These 'individuals' are determined from the statistical analysis of genetic drift in heritable, non-recombining genetic sections: the Y-chromosome, inherited down the paternal line; and the mitochondrial genome, inherited down the maternal line. [Mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_eve) and [Y-chromosomal Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam) didn't even exist at the same time -- they are currently separated by hundreds of thousands of years.

The individual who is thought to be the current Mitochondrial Eve or Y-chromosomal Adam, and the dates at which they lived, have to be moved backwards in time as new lineages are discovered and they also can move forwards as lineages die out. The more fundamental issue is that neither Y-chromosomal Adam, nor Mitochondrial Eve, were the only males, or females, alive at the time: other sections of the genome have different most recent ancestors, separated by huge amounts of time, but recombination makes analysis far less precise. Using the same sorts of genetic analyses that allowed us to discover Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam, since humans arose, there have never been fewer than 1,000 individuals, based on the number of distinct genes found in the genome today.

Why It's Bad: It completely misrepresents data to make it appear to agree with the Biblical narrative when it in fact outright refutes it in multiple ways. 

## Junkyard 747 Argument

Example: The odds of evolution having happened are the same as the odds that a tornado in a junkyard will assemble a Boeing 747.

Counter: Evolution is not an entirely random process, thanks to [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection). The best variants are retained, so evolution doesn't start from scratch every time.

An analogy that explains natural selection's role in evolution would be: Take 10 dice and roll them until you get all of them to show a specific number -- let's say 6. The odds of this happening are infinitesimally small: 1 in 60,466,176.

Now, roll all the dice, but every time one of them reaches 6, keep it aside. Repeat until all show 6. Any given roll is now 1 in 6 to fix a die. To fix the 10 dice will take on average 60 total thrown dice total -- you'll be done in minutes.

Why It's Bad: It ignores one of the central pillars of Darwinian evolution: selection and genetic inheritance.

# BAD EVOLUTION ARGUMENTS

Someone think of one, I'm tired enough from thinking of two for Creationism.

# JUST BAD ARGUMENTS

## YOU WEREN'T THERE

Example: How do you know everything evolved from a universal common ancestor? How do you know the flood didn't happen? How do you X, when you weren't there?

Counter: This is frequently an argument for an given event that occurs very rarely, or perhaps even once. Ultimately, we rely on the scientific principle of [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability). It isn't about seeing the event itself -- after all, every day before I was born I'll never observe, yet I generally accept that at least most of history really happened -- it is about understanding the effects that follow and surround it.

Certain events in evolutionary history were not described by humans in any meaningful way, just as certain events described in theological history were not described by humans in any meaningful way. An event is observable if despite not knowing all the specifics about it, you're still able to make meaningful inferences.

Why It's Bad: Ultimately, either of our sides relies on a certain amount of under-observed events, whether it's Noah and his flood, or early human evolution -- and then unobserved events, such as abiogenesis or the ordinary Genesis. At the end of the day, we can debate about which has more observability, but reducing the argument down to hard proofs, ones that if either side had compete would utterly end this debate entirely, is just not helpful.",141,1517205978,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tqc77/dzugavilis_grand_list_of_rule_7_arguments/

DebateEvolution,7tlqt7,mrcatboy,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Let's discuss Methodological Naturalism: Why does science depend on it?,"Hey all, I realize that philosophy isn't something this subreddit engages in often, but I've always felt that it is so crucial in discussions of creationism and evolution.  This is because while the bulk of the debate focuses on more high-level concepts (genetics, paleontology, cellular biology), core disagreements between scientists and creationists tend to occur on a much more fundamental level.  All the empirical evidence in the world simply won't matter when, in the end, the person you're engaging with doesn't believe in objective reality, for example.

I realize that this is a bit of a megapost, but I **implore** you to read this essay due to its central importance.

Scientists tend to poo-pooh philosophy, which frankly is a rather unfortunate trend.  The fact is, both fields are quite similar.  Much like science, philosophy is a system of critical thinking, and was in fact the field that gave birth to science in the first place by establishing the methods by which science operates.  The method that will be outlined here is something that comes up fairly often in this subreddit:  why science relies on natural explanations, and whether there is room for supernatural entities in science.

**What do we mean when we say “Natural?”**

One of the very first things we do in philosophy is to define, as precisely as possible, our terms.

When we refer to “nature” and “natural” entities in the context of science we aren't talking about something in contrast to artificial constructs.  Even what we call “artificial” things such as computers and nylon are simply natural organisms (humans) taking advantage of natural resources and natural laws to execute specific goals.

No, when scientists and philosophers discuss “nature,” we are referring to the observable world.  Natural entities can be touched, seen, measured, weighed, or otherwise compartmentalized to a specific set of properties.  Natural entities have discrete quantitative and qualitative features.  

Let's consider one natural entity as an example: the human brain.  The brain is a mass of nervous tissue encased in connective tissue components.  On average it weighs approximately 1300-1400 grams, about as much as a small bag of potatoes.  There are ~85 billion neurons in the human brain, and about as many support cells called glia.  We can also divide the brain up functionally: there are specific regions for tactile sensation, vision, linguistic processing, spatial reasoning, etc.  When one region is damaged or otherwise inhibited, you see a corresponding change in mental capacity or behavior.

I can wax on for ages about neuroanatomy, but this segues to another natural entity being investigated by science:  the human mind.  Human cognition can be similarly broken down akin to the software that reflects the biochemical and neural events occurring in the brain.  The human mind is a gestalt of specific processes that operate in parallel:  attention, self-awareness, semantic reasoning, memory storage, memory retrieval, etc.  Many of these functions are localized in specific regions of the brain (linguistic comprehension is localized in a region in the left brain hemisphere, between the temporal and parietal lobes), while others appear to be more spread out (such as memory).  Damage to specific regions will lead to specific deficits in the human mind.

So overall, these two very natural entities *are* natural by virtue of the fact that they have specific properties, both qualitative and quantitative, and can be subject to deep investigation.

**What do we mean when we say “Supernatural?”**

Now lexically, the term “supernatural” means “above” or “beyond” nature.  So “supernatural” refers to the flip side of the coin: entities that have *no* specific properties, or are otherwise impossible to describe.

Whereas the human brain and the human mind can be compartmentalized to increasingly specific descriptions, the human *soul* as is generally conceived eludes such definition and investigation.  The soul can't be measured, observed, or defined.  Any ideas about the soul tend to be generic, vague, or speculative at best: it exists in a wholly alien and incomprehensible realm.

And whereas the brain and the mind are subject to increasingly deeper analysis, such analysis of the soul (and supernatural entities in general) become more problematic the deeper you go.  Look at the following list of questions for example:

* If souls interact through the human body, could the human soul interact through something else?  Could a human soul enter an animal, or a sufficiently complex computer?  Or is it only other human bodies?

* Assuming the human soul is connected to the body somehow, what is the nature of that connection?

* If we can determine the nature of that connection, could that connection be simulated using scientific tools?

* If that soul-body connection can't be simulated, why not?  What are the barriers that keep us from doing this?

* If the soul-body connection *can* be simulated, shouldn't it be possible to do a “soul transplant” and essentially mimic reincarnation under controlled conditions?  Surely there's a market for sinners who believe in Hell who want to try to escape eternal damnation using technological means, for example.

Now, as we go down this list I'm sure many of you are instinctively recoiling on some level.  As these questions probe further and further, they appear to be increasingly absurd... maybe even offensive.  The very act of asking such questions about a supernatural entity, something that is supposed to be so mystical, simply feels *wrong.*

This is because the more we define a thing the more we limit it into a single, compartmentalized form.  While the whole *point* of scientific investigation, the core essence of what it means to be “supernatural” is to have a mystical, elusive quality where the rules of behavior are soft at best, and the potential for anything to happen can exist.  Essentially, *magic.*

You thus notice that Intelligent Design proponents don't really *about* the Intelligent Designer so much as they speak *around* him.  Despite the core importance of the Designer in their hypothesis, it is very much an uncomfortable subject as to what the Designer **is**, precisely.

Some of this is no doubt political: an attempt to deny any relation to the idea's Christian roots and to evade long-standing judicial precedents that bar teaching religion in schools.  Yet it has long been the trend in Western theology to place a supernatural God in a realm that cannot be accessed by rational inquiry.

We see this from Tertullian, who was probably the most vocal early theologian that held the ineffability of God (described well in a quote commonly attributed to him: “credo quia absurdum,” or “I believe that which is absurd (regarding God)”).  The inability to describe God also posed a problem to early Christian theologians, who wanted to attribute some meaning to God while not limiting Him in any way, and necessitated the development of apophatic and cataphatic theologies to resolve this issue.

At this point, three things should be quite clear:

1.  “Natural” entities are those that can be described in specific terms.  When investigating natural entities, the more specific, the better.

2.  “Supernatural” entities are those that cannot be described in specific terms.  When investigating supernatural entities, we avoid specificity.

3.  “Supernatural” entities cannot be scientifically investigated because they cannot be defined or compartmentalized.

Yet even if supernatural entities evade such analysis, can they be used as premises in explaining natural phenomena?  That is, can a “supernatural explanation” work?

**What is an “Explanation?”**

An explanation is a series of premises that form a conceptual bridge between ignorance and understanding.  Each premise is a link interlocked with others, in a chain of reasoning to a specific conclusion.  It is by this means that we can answer questions of fact.

Let's consider a very basic ELI5-type question, and the following explanation:  “How do rainbows occur?”

1.  When a ray of light hits a new medium at an angle (such as from a vacuum to water), the ray can “bend” at an angle.

2.  Visible light is composed of multiple wavelengths.  The wavelengths we see as “Red” are longer, while the wavelengths we see as “Blue” are shorter.

3.  When visible light enters from a vacuum into water, “Blue” wavelengths of light are bent more, and “red” wavelengths of light are bent less.  

4.  This difference in how much each wavelength is bent when entering a new medium causes the different colors of  light to “fan out” in a process we call dispersion.

5.  On rainy or misty days, water particles in the air turn the atmosphere into a medium in which dispersion can occur, much like light entering a glass of water or a prism.  [Hence, rainbows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRuLhY0NAMI)

I would say that this is a minimal explanation sufficient for a fourth grader.  But note the *structure* of this explanation:  each premise is either a basic empirical observation that we can make, or a deduction based on known behaviors of these entities.  These premises are also necessarily linked to the others.  Premises 1 and 2 link through 3, 3 leads to 4, and 4 leads to 5 in an unbroken chain of reasoning.

Moreover, we can improve on this explanation.  We can lead a student through making observations herself by giving her a prism, a protractor, and laser pointers of different colors.  We can bring up the concept of the index of refraction and discuss Snell's law.  We can prove the existence of wavelengths of light.  We can describe the biology of the eye and how we observe colors.  And as we get more specific and detailed with our explanation, our understanding of the phenomenon becomes ever more complete.

Yet it must start here, with a minimal chain of interlocking premises that lead towards a conclusion to get a bare-bones understanding of the phenomenon.

Now, what happens when we remove one of these premises?  Well, the chain of reasoning is broken, the bridge to understanding is incomplete.  With that gap we can no longer say this explanation works the way it should.  This is because *a premise within an explanation works by virtue of its details,* and as we've established, the more thorough the details, the better our understanding.

If the premise instead were “an indescribable entity, through unknowable mechanisms, does something that cannot be specified,” then we see the same problem.  Without specific properties, observations, or demonstrated mechanisms, this potential premise cannot be linked with the others.

And because “an indescribable entity, through unknowable mechanisms, does something that cannot be specified” is the textbook definition of “supernatural,” supernatural entities cannot operate within explanations.

The fact is, the term “natural explanation” is redundant.  **All** explanations in the end function by virtue of being reducible to elementary observations, details, and specified mechanisms.  That is, *natural phenomena*.  And in contrast, “supernatural explanation” is an oxymoron, like a married bachelor.  “Supernatural” and “explanation” are inherently contrary when you consider what these terms mean exactly.",96,1517161883,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7tlqt7/lets_discuss_methodological_naturalism_why_does/

My question comes as this. How can we know if something is truly transitonal. We cannot be sure that a fossil species went on to evolve into new species. It could be an evolutionary dead end. The definition from Berkley says that a transitonal fossil must have descendants. So if a transitonal fossil is an evolutionary dead end, can we still classify it as a transitional fossil?

DebateEvolution,7t655r,GoonDaFirst,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Relationship between one’s opinion of evolution and one’s theological beliefs.,"I think many people who recognize the truth of evolutionary theory deal with creationists the wrong way. 

The usual method is to critique the creationist’s misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, basically showing how their understanding of the science is wrong. While this can be effective, I don’t think it is the most effective way to deal with creationists. 

Instead, I think it is much more effective to have a theological discussion. I don’t believe that a creationist’s critique of evolutionary theory can be separated from their theological view. The theological view is understood to be fundamental, which requires them to deny claims made through evolutionary theory, regardless of the evidence. This means that if the theological view is adequately critiqued, then there will be no reason to hold the anti-evolution views. 

I think some creationists would disagree with how I am framing this, and think they have legitimate scientific reasons to reject evolutionary theory, but I don’t think this disagreement ever amounts to much. 

So I think instead of a purely scientific discussion, we should recognize that a theological understanding is extremely influential on the viewpoints of creationists. Focusing purely on the science is a secondary approach.

Top comment answers the question by... using a completely flawed argument together with a wrong definition of vestigiality,"[Link to the full thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7t1ryq/how_do_creationists_explain_vestigial_organs_amd/)

Definition of [vestigiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality):

&gt; Vestigiality is the retention during the process of evolution of genetically determined structures or attributes **that have lost some or all of their ancestral function in a given species**.

Emphasis on *ancestral* function. So what does the top comment say? In short, the top answer presents several vestigial traits that have been found to (possibly) have function. See how this is already irrelevant given the definition of vestigiality? The argument is irrelevant and therefore already invalidated, but for the sake of discussion we can still look at it.

&gt; For example, evolutionists point to a human tailbone as proof that humans must have had tails at some point. Truth is, the tailbone is important not only for balance, but also for providing an anchor point for the lower extremities.

Well the truth also is, that that tailbone was once much *much* longer and was actually, well, a tail. So it's an example for a reduced ancestral function unless there are still lizard people around (Obama?).

Also, to dive into detail:

&gt; Truth is, the tailbone is important not only for balance, but also for providing an anchor point for the lower extremities.

The claim about gut bacteria is insofar correct, at least when looking at the article. That doesn't change the very real fact that [the human appendix has a very reduced form compared to many other primates and mammals](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vestiges/guts.gif).

This is just a friendly survey question, not any right or wrong answer for the sake of argument, just soliciting your opinion for a book I'm writing....

There is the noticeable nested hierarchy that appears both in molecular and morphological comparisons.  For example, I constructed this phylogentic diagram on the COX1 mitochondrial protein using MEGA 6.0 software.  It recaptures the morphological hierarchy of Linnaeus:

http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nj_differnces_circled2-111-1.png

Fwiw this is the protein in question:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase_subunit_I

Now are the similarities the result of common descent or common design.   It seems to me, if some creature (like a fish) can't evolve into another creature (like a bird), then the patterns of similarity and diversity that for the twin nested hierarchies is the result of common design through likely an act of miraculous special creation.  

Alternatively, one could invoke the Faint Young Sun Paradox and other problems with the fossil record to show there wasn't enough time for evolution.

But all that aside, the bottom line question: ""is there any argument against the probability of evolution (Universal Common Ancestry) that would make you think creation is a possibility?""

If ""yes"" describe it. If you say ""no"", I respect that, but I'm soliciting whether in fact that is your position -- that perhaps nothing short of God showing up in front of you, working miracles and telling you point blank ""evolution is wrong"". If that is your position, I respect that in as much as everyone has their threshold of what would make a believer out them.  So, no right or wrong answer as far as I'm concerned (for the sake of argument), except that if creationism is true then there is a God who decides right and wrong.

&gt; /u/tom-n-texas: The creationist is looking for the small, gradual transitions that link larger groups and prove ancestry by a smooth flow of fossils. These smooth transitions seem not to exist, even admittedly by many evolutionary paleontologists, even by Darwin himself. So it depends on the definition of transitional one uses. Thus the debate.


&gt;&gt;/u/Jattok: See, we're not supposed to downvote the creationists who come here, but this post is exactly why those creationists get downvoted.

&gt;&gt;Your response accuses non-creationists of coining a subjective term, and then you argue that we don't have what creationists expect if evolution is true. **The debate isn't what creationists expect of evolution, but whether evolution explains what we see.** And it does.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a main approach to science. We see a phenomenon, we try to describe it. We hypothesize a process that should explain the phenomenon, we test it. If the process is correctly understood, it should match up with the evidence. If the process is *robustly* understood, we can even start using it as a predictive and retrodictive tool. The scientific method works and we corroborated a process that sufficiently explains a phenomenon.

This perfectly applies to the Theory of Evolution. It stands on its own. It's not based on the invalidity of another hypothesis.


&amp;nbsp;

This is were the flaws of many creationist arguments lie. Their hypothesis is fundamentally based on the *failing* of the ToE. Therefore their best shots are in trying to argue that an aspect of the ToE is not explained enough, which is a *weak*  criticism and can frankly be dismissed if they don't present a *competing* explanation.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm now going to list some of those arguments to show that this is actually the case:


* **Arguments that a certain trait ""could not have evolved""**

1. Relies on the fact that scientists don't have an explanation for every single trait in existence, which should be obvious.

2. Basically a ""God of the gaps"" fallacy just waiting to be debunked. Examples are traits which scientists later were able to explain, which is an expected trend that will continue.

3. Argument does usually not follow with a competing explanation in the form of a demonstrable process. It's entirely reliant on the *failing* of the most prominent explanation and doesn't offer more.

* **Arguments that the process of evolution does not sufficiently explain X**

1. Again, relies on the fact that scientists don't have an explanation for every single evolutionary pathway in existence, which should be obvious.

2. Basically a ""God of the gaps"" fallacy just waiting to be debunked. Examples are evolutionary pathways which scientists later were able to explain, which is an expected trend that will continue.

3. Argument does usually not follow with a competing explanation in the form of a demonstrable process. It's entirely reliant on the *failing* of the most prominent explanation and doesn't offer more.

DebateEvolution,7slyjd,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Crackpot webpages by Stephen T Blume,"This is a recent thread on r/creation:

[Evo-illusionist webpages by Stephen T. Blume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7sj9tx/evoillusionist_webpages_by_stephen_t_blume/)

In it /u/MRH2 praised this Stephen Blume for his sarcastic style, and how he ""cuts into the fooling assumptions of evolution"". So let's have a look at how good this Blume character is.

We start by following the [link to his site.](https://evoillusion.org/) Immediately, two things will become obvious. First, the site looks like it used the best web design principles 1998 had to offer. This is a guy who saw the Space Jam website, and thought ""I must have it"". The text is different fonts and sizes, the background awkwardly repeats with visible edges, a lot of the text colours are hard to read against the background, ads awkwardly cut up parts of the text. The second thing you will notice, is that this guy writes a lot. Every single page seems to be covered in walls of text, and there are a lot of pages. This is the most dangerous breed of creationist; the one with lots and lots of time on his hands, who spends almost all of it writing about creationism. Unfortunately he didn't spend much of that free time learning web design.

After reading through as much of his writing as I could while maintaining my faith in humanity (I didn't get very far), you notice a familiar theme: He doesn't know very much. Indeed, almost every argument he makes is an argument from ignorance. He doesn't know why some organisms haven't evolved much in hundreds of millions of years. He doesn't know about transitional fossils. But the bulk of his site is about how he doesn't know how things evolved. Particularly this quote, also used in the original r/creation post:

&gt; Dawkins thinks that there were 100,000 to 250,000 mutations that evolved eyes. Since eyes have about 30 parts, just how did the 100,000 to 250,000 mutations divvy up amongst the 30 parts? Did 10,000 make the retina? Did 3,450 make the iris?

What's that evolutionists? Sorry...""evo-illusionists"". You don't know the exact number of mutations that it took to evolve each section of the eye? Well obviously if evolution can't identify each and every mutation in our history then it must be wrong. /Sarcasm.

Blume even addresses the models for the evolution of the eye, but instead of explaining where they are wrong, he just asks more questions. He asks where the optic nerves came from, or how the mutations knew to build an eye. Obviously he missed the beginners courses on evolution. Every time you get from step 1 to 2, he asks how you get to step 1.5.

I suspect that almost all of Blume's writing time is spent blindly asking questions about his laymens understanding of biology. Every biological feature he's every heard of will result in him asking ""how did that evolve"". And then he repeats that throughout the whole site. Sometimes it's asked differently. Sometimes he goes into more detail about the feature in question. But the pattern is the same. Describe a feature, ask how it evolved, describe another feature, ask how it evolved.

In other parts of the sites we have a lengthy posts about various debate's he's had across the internet. Not only are these debates long, but he's filled them with commentary and (poor) analysis. He's especially sure to point out each and every time someone was mean to him. I'd be worried this guy has a list of names he intends to ""cross off"" one day. Unfortunately the site doesn't appear to be active any more. If it were, I would recommend this guy come here, so we can tear him a new one.",24,1516786143,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7slyjd/crackpot_webpages_by_stephen_t_blume/
DebateEvolution,7sbiop,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"More Experimental Refutation of this ""Genetic Entropy"" Hogwash, From a Different Angle: ""Adaptation Obscures the Load""","[Here's the paper.](http://www.genetics.org/content/184/1/221)

A bit of introduction. Creation ""scientists"" like John Sanford claim that mutation accumulation will lead to ""genetic entropy,"" a decrease in fitness ultimately causing extinction, due to the accumulation of deleterious (i.e. harmful) mutations.

No study has ever shown this to be the case, though there have been many attempts (including by me! Half my thesis was about my attempts to induce error catastrophe in single-stranded DNA bacteriophages).

A pair of studies by Crotty et al. are often used to argue that this does actually happen, but neither of these experiments supports that claim. One shows that a mutagen causes mutations (duh), and that can inactivate viral genomes in a single generation via a burst of mutations. This is not ""genetic entropy"" because that process requires a loss of fitness *over generations*. Sure, enough mutagen will just kill a thing all at once, but that's not the same. The other study show a fitness loss over generations, but was unable to demonstrate that that the accumulation of deleterious mutations were the cause, and due to the other affects in cells of nucleoside analogues like the chosen mutagen, [it's unlikely that mutation alone was to blame.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16287208) 

&amp;nbsp;

[The study I want to talk about](http://www.genetics.org/content/184/1/221) experimentally examines why error catastrophe, which is very readily predicted based on some basic population genetics, is extremely challenging. The answer something I don't think we've discussed here in all of our topics on ""genetic entropy"": As you cause mutations, you end up causing a TON of beneficial mutations. So while you may be able to decrease fitness by some degree, you at some point reach an equilibrium between the rate of deleterious and adaptive mutations. 

Remember, every time a deleterious mutation happens, you've now removed one deleterious mutation from the pool of all possible mutations, and added *at least* one beneficial mutation (the reversal) to that pool. The beautiful thing about this dynamic is that *higher mutation rates can't overcome it*. The equilibrium point is independent of the mutation rate, because the *relative* rate of good and bad mutations will not change if they are happening faster. The dynamic equilibrium is simply more dynamic. 

&amp;nbsp;

[So in addition to all of the other reasons why genetic entropy is bunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/), we have another: Adaptive mutations put a floor beneath which fitness will not fall, and accumulating mutations faster cannot overcome this barrier.

DebateEvolution,7r9qf9,tacforall,,,self.DebateEvolution,,A few questions about ERV’s,"ERV’s are claimed to make it probable that certain species are related, since the seemingly related species (established by other evidence such as similar bone structure) have ERV’s at the same spots. 

Are there scientific answers to the following questions? 

1. Because *apoptosis* would kill most ERV-containing cells, why is it that we still have so many ERVs hundreds of thousands of years after supposedly being inserted by retroviruses? (Also: is this assumption true?)

2. Are there more cases of similar ERV’s between species that are thought to be related, besides of apes and humans?

3. Another problem for the evolutionary explanation is that very similar ERVs exist in unrelated animals:

&gt;We have sequenced and characterized an endogenous type D retrovirus, which we have named TvERV(D), from the genome of an Australian marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Intact TvERV(D) gag, pro, pol, and env open reading frames were detected in the possum genome. TvERV(D) was classified as a type D retrovirus, most closely related to those of Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and mice, based on phylogenetic analyses and genetic organization.”[13]

&gt;“For instance gamma-retrovirus was isolated from trophoblastic cells of the baboon placenta. This virus was found to be very closely related antigenically and by sequence homology to the endogenous RD114 virus in cats (which is itself unrelated to endogenous FeLV). Benveniste and Todaro observed, like we did for jungle fowl, that only certain species of the cat genus, Felis, possessed this endogenous genome related to the baboon ERV. In contrast, all species of baboons carry this virus so it would appear to have been present in the germ line of primates much longer than in cats. Thus it seems evident that a horizontal, infectious event occurred to transfer the virus from baboons to cats, whereupon it became endogenous in the new species.”[14]

&gt;How do the authors “explain” this?
“Since cats would be quite likely to scavenge and feed on baboon placentae, a possible exposure to the virus can be envisioned.”[14]

Is this the case and how often are similar ERV’s found in (according to evolution theory) non related animals? And is there a difference in similarity between the ERV’s found in the unrelated animals and related animals?

4) What proves that the ERV’s found in the related species are in fact injected by retroviruses?

Basically I’m interested in your responses to this article: http://evolutiondismantled.com/ervs

Perhaps:

A) The article has errors and/or straw man fallacies 

B) The article shows that the explanations for the falsifications of the ERV Theory are ad hoc/non falsifiable theirselves and/or based upon other evidence for evolution (which would remove ERV theory from the list of evidence). 

C) Scientific answers are available to the questions

DebateEvolution,7r9g9c,Deadlyd1001,Scientifically Literate Hobbyist,,self.DebateEvolution,,To a claim in r/creation on missing fossils and phylogeny,"This is just a quick reply to a comment  in /r/Creation, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7r74ht/could_we_put_a_list_of_arguments_against/dsuqvyr/) in which u/tom-n-texas  claims 
&gt;The common ancestors between higher classes of animals are missing. Dogs and cats, for example had to share a common ancestor. But where is this fossil creature? Same with horses and cows. Elephants and giraffes. Humans and chimps. Etc etc. but they're all missing. 

The crown ancestor to cats and dogs were [Miacids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacoidea) of which there are a decent number of fossils discovered and they are unequivocally containing basal ""transitional"" features of both cats and dogs. This took only 2 minutes to find, I went to Wikipedia's page on [Carnivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora#Phylogeny) and clicked around the phylogeny section, boom really easy.  

As for the other examples I just had to dig a little deeper. Humans and chimps, there are quite a few fossils of more basal creature to those, see [wikipedia again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homininae#Taxonomic_classification) or more specifically this [one species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierolapithecus) which is exactly what you ask for. 


As for Elephants and Giraffes, that is really a sign of how little you know on this subject, those trees connect as far back as two extant mammal lineages can be while still both being Placental, [see this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal#Molecular_classification_of_placentals), so their common ancestor would be all the way back to one of the [Eutheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutheria) (a classification so old that its was named by Gill/ Huxley back in the 1880s) 

Horses and Cows? Those are an odd toed and an even toed ungulates respectively so you are looking for a very basal ungulate in the [condylarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condylarth) family, which is currently a bit cluttered and foggy exact were everything goes, so somehow here you got one right, I cannot find the definitive fossil that links cows and horses together, but all the other ones you asked for were pretty simple to find. 

For fun I look at Phylogentic trees of life like [this](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer), [that](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html/@Euryarchaeota=635958?vis=spiral#x398,y455,w0.4086),  [this other one here](http://tolweb.org/Animals/2374), or just the phylogeny section of clades in Wikipedia.  All based on some combination of vast amount overlapping morphological structures, genetics, embryological/infant development, and fossil records of basically every step, do we have perfect records covering every species?, no, but scientist have discovered far more [transition fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils) (and this list is very incomplete) than you know about or is needed to demonstrate their existence.  

He continues with
&gt;Despite the fact that these common ancestors evolved after the dinosaurs died out. We find all kinds of Dino fossils right up near the surface of the ground. And thus we should be finding these mammal common ancestors at or above the layers where the Dino's are. But again the evidence for evolution is never to be found. 
     

A proper explanation for this would require a more deep dive into the geology of uplift, erosion and other mechanics of surface features but the short version is that only a very small amount of the layers holding dinosaurs fossils are near the surface (usually in desolate rocky places like the Mongolian Desert or the Dakota Badlands), so anywhere that we can find the mammal fossils in question the dinosaur fossils will be buried inaccessibly deep underneath them, large excavations of rock is not really an efficient manner for archaeology departments to find fossils. Though as u/denisova constantly points out with his copy-paste Grand Canyon layering speel, there is plenty of diversity within a single column of rock. YEC flood geology has far more layering issues than actual scientific models, it YEC is correct then we should find fossil whales in the same layers as trilobites, tigers near dromaeosaurs, and bats and modern birds next to Pterosaurs, but those haven't been found. If you really think that there is no [evidence for evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent) or for the [earth being old](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation) then yall got a hell of a lot of well supported science to overthrow. 

Now, does anyone still want to claim that transitional fossils haven't been found?",93,1516279473,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7r9g9c/to_a_claim_in_rcreation_on_missing_fossils_and/
DebateEvolution,7r6zts,No-Karma-II,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Evolutionists, I have a question for you...","Evolutionists, I have a question for you...

If you meet the following criteria:

1.) You claim that since no one can prove God's existence or non-existence, you are an agnostic;

2.) You claim that proper science is based on the Methodological Naturalism Presupposition (and this also means that you do *not* claim to be a Philosophical Naturalist, else the BDMNP would be superfluous);

then:

Since the BDMNP superintends over your science, it cannot itself be scientific, and furthermore, your science only considers natural causes as candidates for the causes of natural phenomena, even though you cannot rule out supernatural causation.

Again, you cannot rule out supernatural agency; therefore you must be able to deal with the possibility of existential supernatural causation in our natural world.

So, let's assume for a moment that a supernatural agent **did in fact** kick-start (i.e., was the cause of) the first life. What would your science look like in this case? Having ruled out *a priori* the real cause of the first life, you must wander about aimlessly, trying to concoct a plausible naturalistic cause, even though none exists. In the end, you would have to settle for the least improbable natural cause, no matter how improbable it is in absolute terms.

No amount of ""scientific"" evidence could ever convince you that life had a supernatural cause (even though it did), and you would descend into endless quibbles over which natural cause was most likely (read: least unlikely) to be the actual cause, when in fact none of them were.

I've been asking about this for some time, and haven't every gotten a straight answer. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does irreducible complexity include apply to instances including *just* selection for beneficial states, or are other processes, like drift, recombination, and duplication involved? Does it only apply to instances of constant fitness landscapes, or are variable fitness landscapes also included?

If the answers to these questions are ""just selection, and just constant landscapes,"" then IC is wrong because it omits a giant chunk of evolutionary processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

If it applies even including the full range of evolutionary processes, is the claim that *no* IC system can evolve? If that is the case, then it is wrong because we have observed the evolution of systems that meet the criteria for IC.

&amp;nbsp;

Or is the claim only that *some* systems that meet these criteria cannot evolve? If that is the case, then it is an unfalsifiable argument from ignorance; anything with a documented or observed evolutionary pathway could of course have evolved, but there will always be something that we haven't figured out yet which could be claimed as IC.

DebateEvolution,7qh64d,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"This is what counts as ""brilliant"" to creationists? Okay...","So this story starts with the publication of a piece by DI hack Stephen Meyer in which he present no original data, but claims that the Cambrian Explosion is best explained by design. Identity of designer? Mechanism of design? No no, jus ""design,"" and leave it at that, thank you very much. 

Now, there are clearly some problems here, and the paper was ultimately pulled, because maybe we shouldn't be publishing half-developed ideas with no data beyond ""gee things sure are complicated,"" but that's not going to stop esteemed talk-downer and Very Smart Person David Berlinski from [bemoaning the state of Big Science](http://www.discovery.org/a/2450), and it is this bemoaning that has r/creation in a tizzy over Berlinski being ""brilliant, as always"". 

So let's see what Berlisnki says.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The suggestion that Darwin's theory of evolution is like theories in the serious sciences — quantum electrodynamics, say — is grotesque. Quantum electrodynamics is accurate to thirteen unyielding decimal places. Darwin's theory makes no tight quantitative predictions at all.

I feel like *Tiktaalik* alone is enough to refute this one, but just to dot the i's there's also the remnants of telomeres and centromeres in human chromosome 2. Neat, specific predictions that were subsequently confirmed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Field studies attempting to measure natural selection inevitably report weak to non-existent selection effects. 

I feel like someone should remind him about antibiotic and pesticide resistance. I particularly like the part where we [experimentally determined likely pathways to resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1462546/) based on the selective advantage conferred by combinations of mutations, and then one of those novel resistance genotypes later appeared naturally. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Darwin's theory is open at one end since there are no plausible account for the origins of life.

[Ahem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ssv4s/abiogenesis_hypothesis_and_evidence_of/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The astonishing and irreducible complexity of various cellular structures has not yet successfully been described, let alone explained.

[Ahem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/61nda6/the_irreducible_complexity_is_not_a_valid/)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;A great many species enter the fossil record trailing no obvious ancestors and depart for Valhalla leaving no obvious descendents. 

God of the [literal] gaps. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Where attempts to replicate Darwinian evolution on the computer have been successful, they have not used classical Darwinian principles, and where they have used such principles, they have not been successful.

Oh he's taking John Sanford seriously, that's adorable. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that what David Berlinski considers valid principles are not what evolutionary biologists consider the same. I'm confident in this suggestion because no evolutionary biologists consider ""classical"" Darwinian evolution (which I can only guess means evolution involving *only* mutation and selection) a reasonable representation of how evolution works. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Tens of thousands of fruit flies have come and gone in laboratory experiments, and every last one of them has remained a fruit fly to the end, all efforts to see the miracle of speciation unavailing. 

I don't know why he thinks a fruit fly would evolve into something else in an environment designed specifically to raise fruit flies, but okay, the claim is speciation can't happen. Sigh. Central African cichlids, apple maggot flies, European blackcaps, HIV...and these are just examples that humans have directly observed. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The remarkable similarity in the genome of a great many organisms suggests that there is at bottom only one living system; but how then to account for the astonishing differences between human beings and their near relatives — differences that remain obvious to anyone who has visited a zoo?

Differences in gene sequence, gene regulation and expression patterns, and development? It's like he's never actually studied evolutionary biology. 

&amp;nbsp;

That's it. Those are his arguments. I know. Tell me about it. I could be making three times my salary turning out this drivel for DI. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, let's put aside for a moment that literally every point Berlinski makes is invalid. Maybe he's just upset, and the denizens of r/creation with him, that design theory is being shut out of the scientific discussion unfairly, and the contributions and potential advances made by design theory to our understand of the world are being suppressed.

I also had the chance to see why the arguments were unneceserely complex. I tried to rephrase it to a new argument. I hope y’all can take a look and tell me if the argumentation are right or wrong:

Cause argument:

1. Cause and effect for empirical observable things is a strong law 
2. The universe is a empirically observable thing 
3. The universe is probably caused
4. Universe started at time X, according to science

This means that:
A) The universe is self caused 
B) An non empirically observable entity like God caused the universe. 
C) Uncaused X caused the universe

A
1 We have examples of empirically observable things
2 We only have examples of caused empirically observable things (law of cause and effect)
3 We have no examples of any self caused empirically observable things or evidence for uncaused empirically observable things. 
4 Science suggests the universe has a beginnig

Thus A = special pleading because it is limited by what we currently know (about causal relationships and the universe)

B
1 We have no direct examples of Gods (this is impossible by definition)
2 we have no examples of caused gods 
3 we have no examples of uncaused gods 

Thus B is special pleading because we have no direct evidence for B (but not limited by what we know)

C) We have no examples of uncaused X

Thus C = special pleading because we have no evidence 

Considering A is not
probable because our knowledge about the universe shows the unlikelihood, B and C are better options. 

Now personally I wonder, what else could it be a good explanation than an conscious intelligent creator? (A)

Why does it makes sense to imagine B?

The following:

1. We design things (humans, animals)
2. Something has to be infinite/uncaused, according to the first argument
3. There is no reason to assume that what exists is limited to the empirical

&gt;Most of them just think this is the new fact of science so it would help alot if Christians subscribe to their steam forum and game or discord and chat with them with out arguments. 

First of all, the idea of birds being a subset of and descendant from dinosaurs is not a new idea, in fact it was one of the first confirmed predictions of Darwin after his treatise on evolution was published. After looking at the traits of modern birds and fossil dinosaurs and noticing certain similarities in bone structure he predicted that there should be fossils found with intermediate traits in between, including hip shape, toothed mouth to beak transition, and feathered arm with fingers to fused wing. Just a couple of years after publishing ""On the Origins of Species ""archaeopteryx was discovered satisfying all of his predictions. 

But archaeopteryx was not the only dinosaur that we know had feathers, only the first one, since then [dozens of fossils with feathers have been discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dinosaur_species_preserved_with_evidence_of_feathers) mostly small dinosaurs but also some fairly large ones like [Yutyrannus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutyrannus), which was estimated to be about 3 tons when alive,. There are also finds of fluffy down and quill like structures in other non therapod dinosaurs lineages, sources [here](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/140724-feathered-siberia-dinosaur-scales-science/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosaurus). 

&gt; Anyone interested? If no one speaks then most of the gaming community in Saurian is just going to believe that trex had feathered and well they came from birds and they also sounded like a soft duck.

Another species of dinosaur with feathers is [this fella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilong_paradoxus) who seems to be basal to all [Tyrannosauroidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosauroidea), so yes T-rex was probably feathered. I should put emphasis here that scientists think (and can show with a surprising large number of fossils) that birds came from dinosaurs and are a subset of therapod dinosaurs, not the other way around.

That by using the same genetic methods that give us relationship diagrams like [this](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer), [that](http://www.onezoom.org/life.html/@Euryarchaeota=635958?vis=spiral#x398,y455,w0.4086) or [another one](http://tolweb.org/Animals/2374)
and by ignoring the vast amount overlapping morphological structures, genetics, embryological/infant development, and fossil records of basically every step, one can just trim the tree at roughly the sub-family level, and everything works out just fine?

Turns out that Answers In Genesis went an subdivided a decent chunk of the EVILutionist's phylogentic tree into the Orchard of [Baramin 'kinds'](https://answersingenesis.org/noahs-ark/determining-the-ark-kinds/), they got [Snakes, tuataras, and worm lizards](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-extant-tuatara-amphisbaena-and-snake-kinds/), proper [lizards](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/initial-estimation-numbers-and-identification-of-order-squamata/), [birds](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-of-avian-ark-kinds/), [mammals](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/mammalian-ark-kinds/), [frogs](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-the-frog-kinds-on-the-ark-order-anura/), other [amphibians](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/identifying-and-numbering-amphibian-kinds-results/""), and [turtles and crocodiles](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/an-initial-estimate-toward-identifying-and-numbering-the-ark-turtle-and-crocodile-kinds/). Along with some other interesting choices by looking at fossil [amphibians](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/fossil-baramins-noahs-ark-amphibians/) (they just describe each family and move on) and a weird article where they constuct a tree for [blood flukes](https://answersingenesis.org/creation-science/baraminology/baraminic-study-blood-flukes-family-schistosomatidae/) which is just bizarre in how it looks like a well documented science overview, it really struck home why so many creationists are fooled by AIG and similar sites, they state the science around and about the topic of interest but before they actually make a revolutionary, scientifically interesting claim/experiment/actual rebuttal, the article ends.  

Apparently they have been there for a quite a few years, the articles were published October 2012 to Febuary 2014. I am kind of surprised that no one has pulled them while I've been on this sub, looks like it got mentioned 2 years ago in this comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3w568m/a_challenge_to_creationists_how_many_kinds_are/cxu0hml/) on a discussion of 'kinds' , but did not get any further comments. 

The issues with their orchards should be fairly obvious, sniping 'kinds' off of the phylogentics tree with no real justification as to why there and not elsewhere, all of the similarities between, by every metric we have, closely related creatures becoming completely unrelated 'kinds',  the necessary super fast evolution to get to the current number of species (especially given the incredible limited gene-pool of just 1 or 7 pairs of creatures), fossils of more basal creatures in two separated ""kinds""  are almost impossible to place into just one category (""the dog-bears were bear 'kind'."", ""No they were dog 'kind'!""), the absurd number of new kinds needed to include all of the known extinct genera, and countless more.  

They also still fall into the issue of having all cats being of the same 'kind' leading to   evolution (ops, I must have meant ""adaption"") having to have happened in a even more supercharged speed than for the rest of the animals to get the feline kind separated enough for both house cats and lions to have their likeness carved into Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian art (some were even [mummified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_mummy)). A timescale that by using AIG's time of the flood 2348 BC and Egyptian civilization springing up after (yes I know that Archaeologists say that by that time the great pyramids would have probably already been fully constructed, but since when have experts in a field been trustworthy 
 /s) was at most generous 1000 years, this can probably be push even tighter by someone who actually knows anything about Egyptian and Sumerian art, or by the bible itself in which [Judah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+49.9&amp;version=NIV) (great grandson of Abraham) is described by his father as a lion. 

There so much more fundamentally wrong with their breakdown of the Phylogentic tree, I would very much like to see the criticism from someone who really knows one of the clades that AIG broke into kinds.

I legit had a laughing fit for a good 10 minutes.  Usually I like to simply disagree with the points that I have problems with, but this actually caught me fully off-guard.  I really thought it was satire until cordova started agreeing with it and defending it.  

Now, it's not exactly as crazy as it might look, but it's going to REALLY show off just how pseudo-scientific creationism can get, this time reaching into UFO and abduction stories.  The main issue with this is that this was already an entirely different area of crazy that already had its own issues.  

The second trailer linked in particular features an abduction story later into it where the man is unable to move and terrified, and then wakes up in a panic.  This could be demons manipulating him, or it could be **sleep paralysis, as has already been used to debunk loads of abduction bullshit**.  

Anyway, I think this constitutes ""going over the edge,"" and I expect this will be the only time I cross a creation post onto here.  Then again, creationists are more prone to fall into conspiracy-style beliefs than most demographics, particularly on the extreme end, so...

EDIT:  Bonus points for his reply, in which he implicitly admits that the entire thing is targeting vulnerable populations (talk to conspiracy theorists, and you will know why I do not respect them; then again, duping them into bullshit for gain isn't exactly something I'm opposed to, as I've somewhat lost hope in the ability to help them).

In this article the author says, ""It turns out that no series of fossils can provide evidence for Darwinian descent with modification. Even in the case of living species, buried remains cannot generally be used to establish ancestor-descendant relationships. Imagine finding two human skeletons in the same grave, one about thirty years older than the other. Was the older individual the parent of the younger? Without written genealogical records and identifying marks (or in some cases DNA), it is impossible to answer the question. And in this case we would be dealing with two skeletons from the same species that are only a generation apart and from the same location. With fossils from different species that are now extinct, and widely separated in time and space, there is no way to establish that one is the ancestor of another–no matter how many transitional fossils we find.In 1978, Gareth Nelson of the American Museum of Natural History wrote: 'The idea that one can go to the fossil record and expect to empirically recover an ancestor-descendant sequence, be it of species, genera, families, or whatever, has been, and continues to be, a pernicious illusion.'13 Nature science writer Henry Gee wrote in 1999 that 'no fossil is buried with its birth certificate.' When we call new fossil discoveries 'missing links,' it is 'as if the chain of ancestry and descent were a real object for our contemplation, and not what it really is: a completely human invention created after the fact, shaped to accord with human prejudices.' Gee concluded: 'To take a line of fossils and claim that they represent a lineage is not a scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime story–amusing, perhaps even instructive, but not scientific.'""

I have also heard the example used that if the different dog breeds we have today were fossils scientists would say how a chuwawa evolved into a great dane.

Even though Sanford [repeatedly lies about his sources](https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/stan-4/), /u/nomenmeum insists ""I could find no way that Dawkins’s analogy is better than Sanford’s"" when comparing Sanford's analogy of wagons and starships, and Dawkin's sentence of ""METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL."" Dawkins openly admits that his analogy is not that great because it assumes the conclusion, something that evolution does not do, but he uses it to illustrate how selection makes evolution anything but random.

Sanford's analogy, though, also fails, because it assumes that selection will only work on the best of the simpler features, not guide them into something more complex. For example, if one of these wagons was able to grow wings, then it could get air if it got up to the proper speed. If nothing selected against wings, the wings would continue to survive like any other neutral wagon trait. But once utilized and improved the wagon's ability to travel, that trait would propagate far better.

Creationists on /r/creation love to have these imaginary battles based on their ignorance of science, promoting charlatans like Sanford who keep pushing their discredited ideas, banking on the fact that creationists love being lied to as long as it fits their beliefs, yet not one of those people on /r/creation can ever properly defend their points of view against those who understand what they're talking about.

Thus they have their hugbox, their safe space, where discredited and dishonest ideas go virtually unchallenged...

More replies: 

&gt;No James, the problem begins with your inability to explain whether or not you believe that killing a man is the same as killing a dog. Lots of scientific blindness stems from moral blindness.

&gt;You say that the dice argument proves nothing without giving even the slightest reason. Note clearly too that I am not demanding that you agree with me. Not at all.  But I do require you to answer my argument with a counter argument rather than mere baseless denial devoid of data or argument. 

&gt;Your response is a classic Evolutionist’s response. It is nothing better than a strategy called, “Deny the evidence, move the discussion to another topic and hope the evidence is forgotten.”

&gt;Also I do not believe your responses to other questions are not based on anything more than internet searches of critics of Creationists. I have a hard time actually believing you think about the information you quote. You give little indication of any critical assessment in any case.

&gt;When I point out the dishonesty and falsification of evidence by Evolutionists including Dawkins, you do not see it as important. But when you find in your internet searches that,  for example Wells has one wrong view, that in your mind destroys his credibility on all other issues. Remind me James, your Ph. D. is in what field? What a pity you do not do react to Dawkins and others in the same way you react to Wells, since if you applied the same standards to Dawkins and co. you would have rejected their arguments long ago.

&gt;I am not interested in continuing the discussions with you any longer on these terms. You only appear willing to cut and paste from the internet, mostly in my view very uncritically. 

&gt;And when  I cannot present counter arguments to the numerous cut and pastes, which would require me to have in depth knowledge from several areas of science to Ph.D level and still be to explain it in terms that a higher schooler, even a bright one like you, can understand, you accuse me of not being willing to engage. I must point out again that I have a 48 hour per work engineering job.

&gt;Although you cannot even explain the mechanism of how C14 is generated in the atmosphere you pretend to understand how C14 could have contaminated coal, since in your view coal must be as old as Evolutionists need it to be.  You appear to believe that being able to memorise scientific terminology and to repeat it, is the same understanding it and being able to analyse the claims surrounding it. But without even the basis knowledge of how C14 is generated how do you believe you understand the proposed contamination mechanisms? And when I point out that at least some of these proposed contamination mechanisms are patently foolish, for example, contamination by mining equipment, you ignore the science and move on to your next “gotcha quote.”

&gt;You may call my unwillingness to continue our discussion on these subjects as a refusal to engage but it is not. I am willing but when you deny evidence and claim to know more than Francis Crick when he points out how little power to predict Evolution has, there is no rational point to our discussions. 

&gt;You read a book entitled “Irrefutable” yet by definition, indeed clear definition the fact that even Dawkins himself says the he doesn’t have all the answers he (not me but Dawkins himself) sees a need for, then his theory is not proven. A theory not proven is by definition not irrefutable. 

&gt;When you are willing to answer whether why you think killing a man is different to killing a dog, we can pick our discussions again. Until that time I have nothing more to say to you on this topic.
 
See how he just ignores most of my arguments?

On fossil skulls.

&gt;No James, you did not present me with fossil skulls, You showed me a photo of reconstructed skulls lined up on line for a book.
No dates.
No proof of the ancestry of one to the other. 
No mention that they were found thousands of kilometres apart. 
No mention of how much of the “skull” is original bone or original fossil, and how much is plaster.

&gt;You don’t wish to remember the frauds we have already discovered do you? Piltdown Man, Peking Man, Nebraska Man...?

&gt;Are all these skulls frauds? NO! But a photo of a row of reconstructed skulls, devoid of even the most basic details or location, % of plaster, confirmed dates as per above, is not a row of actual skulls.

&gt;The quote I gave you below shows that what you see in books as the artist’s impressions, is sometimes deliberately constructed as propaganda. The artist admitted that he deliberately drew this ape-man face to show what the ape-man would become. 

&gt;If you search the net for artists impressions of Neanderthals you will find such a wide variation in appearance that you will prove my point for me.

Regarding Vestigiality:

&gt;It was your quote and you boasted that Creationism had been put to death in 1912 or words to that effect.

&gt;Never the less you claimed via the quote that there were instances of human vestigial organs being put into, or pressed into some other role.

&gt;Apart from the appendix, name one human vestigial organ. 
Name its original function. 
Name its new function. 
Provide evidence that it adapted from its original function to its new function. 
Provide evidence that the organ did not have multiple roles built into it from the start.

&gt;And of course, what is the proof that the appendix is vestigial, i.e. not doing anything important as a leftover organ?

&gt;This is yet another instance of where you quote a quote, build a straw man argument and then when questions are asked of you and your quote, you ignore the obvious and return with a different quote from some other source. And you claim Creationists do not engage in the debate!

Here's the response:

&gt;I didn't ask God what His view was. I asked you.

&gt;Do you think killing a dog is that same as killing a man?

After suggesting theistic evolution:

&gt;When you face up to the inevitable moral consequences of Evolution, then we can discuss why, in my view God neither did not could due to His character use Evolution to create the world.

Whatever happened to, ""God works in mysterious ways?""

&gt;But do not use this last sentence as a way of avoiding giving your answer to, ""Do you think killing a dog is that same as killing a man?""

*sigh*

In response to mutation and natural selection being the mechanism to generate information:

&gt;But you still have not addressed the facts James. The mathematical facts illustrated in the dice example.  Instead you continue to deal in slogans..Creationism is Intelligent Design which is Creationism rebranded.....

Now, I know that this sounds like heresy to you people, but talking to him in person is like talking to Saruman.

Bruce: Do you agree with Crick that the Evolution is very poor at predicting anything?

Me: No. (By the way, I'm not sure if Crick is getting quote mined or not in *What Mad Pursuit,* as I haven't read it, and talkorigins is null on it.)

Bruce: Do you agree with Crick that the evidence of design has to be continually ignored in order to believe in Evolution?

Me: No.

Now, I probably should have done my research and specifically pointed out organized complexity and hunted down the quote mining, but I didn't. 

His response:

&gt;Now, on what basis (evidence) do you as a high schooler (without even a B.Sc, let alone a Ph.D. and as far as you have told me no Noble Prize, or are you simply being modest?) , disagree with Crisk one of the discoverers of the structure of DNA?

He's even got the cheek to question MY qualifications, despite him being an electrical engineer who happened to take a course on biology and geology!!! 

He also promised to deliver on his claim that Dawkins couldn't provide an information generating mechanism. Somewhat odd, seeing as he's wrote entire books on the topic.

I'm fairly sure Bruce is recollecting a certain interview where Dawkins was duped by creationists and then edited to look like he changed the subject.

When I checked my inbox, there was a whole bunch of creationist material. 

First of all, a demand to see the numerous vestigial organs alluded to in one of my quotes from talkorigins. Sadly, I've been procastinating. 

&gt;By the way, I am still waiting for the “many instances” where some organ(s) of the human body has “pressed into some other service” though they were parts that are “clearly vestigial”. You remember the quote from your doctor friend from about 1912 or something like it? 

&gt;May I ask again, which “clearly vestigial” organs or parts did the doctor mention? (So far you have not mentioned none.) How did the doctor know they were vestigial? (So far you have offered no proof of the organs being vestigial.)


I looked at the original quote:

&gt;""The vermiform appendage—in which some recent medical writers have vainly endeavoured to find a utility—is the shrunken remainder of a large and normal intestine of a remote ancestor. This interpretation of it would stand even if it were found to have a certain use in the human body. Vestigial organs are sometimes pressed into a secondary use when their original function has been lost.""

Joseph McCabe 
The Story of Evolution (1912), p. 264

I'm not sure if he read the whole book, but where this ""many instances"" came from is a bit mystifying.

Quoting Dawkins:

&gt;At one point in that debate Lennox observed that, due to the complexities of life, the word miracle comes up frequently in origin of life studies, and there’s no way that natural forces can explain those complexities. 



&gt;Dawkins responded by saying, “Well, you’re asserting that there is no way. We don’t yet know what it is because there’s a lot of work yet to be done. Science doesn’t yet know everything. There are still gaps.” How does Dawkins know science will close those gaps? He doesn’t. He has faith. He is committing the “natural law of the gaps” fallacy. Dawkins has faith that one day we will find a natural cause for digital information. Skeptic Michael Shermer shares Dawkins’ faith. In his debate with John Lennox, Shermer asserted that we ought to give science fifty more years before drawing any conclusion....”



&gt;From “Stealing from God”, Frank Turek. 



&gt;I am sure there are more quotes like this where Dawkins admits that he knows of no mechanism for creating design from randomness, but I could be wrong....I will keep searching.

Just to clarify: I'm certain that there is no such quote, or that it's a quote mine. Should I tell him?

This paper has a few glaring issues that I saw (much like other purported ""science"" papers that creationists have attempted to sneak in trying to undercut evolution).

One part is this:

&gt; This distribution used by Kimura only accounts for deleterious mutations. He points out: “Note that in this formulation, we disregard beneficial mutants, and restrict our consideration only to deleterious and neutral mutations. Admittedly, this is an oversimplification, but as I shall show later, a model assuming that beneficial mutations also arise at a constant rate independent of environmental changes leads to unrealistic results” (Kimura 1979).

Kimura 1979 is this paper: http://www.pnas.org/content/76/7/3440.short

It appears that Sanford and Basener only pull out the one part of the paper that they wanted, and ignored the rest.

If anyone else can access these papers they cite, it would be interesting how much cherry picking and deception this paper includes. I would also be interested in knowing why the creationist paper intentionally ignored beneficial mutations in its calculations, or why it ignores the numerous populations which continue growing, contrary to their models?",4,1514329729,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7mb2va/trolling_stcordova_posts_a_link_at_rcreation/
DebateEvolution,7m792o,Graphitii,Hello There,,self.DebateEvolution,,A little help with this email?,"Bruce is up to his usual antics once more, asking me the difference between killing dogs and people. I told him that they were different species. 

I got this monster reply:

&gt;Hi *****,

&gt;So it is wrong to kill a different species but not wrong to kill a member of your own species?

 &gt;By your logic it is wrong to kill a dog, which is a different species to humans but not wrong to kill a human if you are a human.

&gt;This is one of the biggest problems with Evolutionary thought. 

&gt;Evolutionists refuse, or are unable, to follow their conclusions to where they logically lead. An Evolutionist will say there is no God but will pretend there is an absolute morality. This is your current problem. You know that to kill a man is different to killing a dog. But because you believe in Evolution you cannot have moral absolutes, since moral absolutes cannot arise from random processes. You know that absolutes can only arise from the Absolute. You have to refuse to follow your logical thought to where it inevitably leads, to the foot of the Absolute One.

&gt;And you end up therefore in all kinds of wafly arguments. On what basis is it wrong for a member of one species to kill a member of another? That is how, after all we got here. We got here, if you believe in Evolution because our ancestors were better thieves, murderers, rapists and killers of our own species because they out performed and out competed those unlucky ape-men who didn't have our better killing skills. And we dominated because we were are to hunt and kill other species for food. Either way, we got here because we are good at killing anything competing with us.

&gt;Kill a dog or a child and what is the difference, if by doing so I further my own survival and that of my offspring.

&gt;It is no use pointing out that this is what is happening today.  The question is, ""Is it morally right to  literally kill the competition and, if they are tasty to eat them, even if this means cannibalism?""





&gt;Now for predictions, Evolution cannot make predictions with any more reliability than a horoscope, and horoscopes are typically vague and sometimes appear to be correct.

**NOTE:** The predictions Bruce is talking about were copypasted from a comment here. 

&gt;If you make a single prediction and get that single prediction right then you have proved nothing, particularly if the prediction is a simple one, like you semi-toothed whale prediction. When the designers of the surface of the racing yacht wanted to improve the keel surface they first tried to make it absolutely smooth. The they took another approach; they looked in Nature and copied the surface of the skin of a shark.

&gt;Now if this idea had been suggested by a Creationist he could have said, “God has made sharks to swim very well. Let’s look at their skins and see if we can learn anything.” He would then claim justification for his prediction and may claim this as a proof for creationism. If however the first person who thought of the idea was an Evolutionist, he might have said , “Over billions of years Evolution has given the shark a low friction surface. Let’s see if we can copy the shark’s skin.”

&gt;Clearly, neither argument is a proof. Both are untestable claims but the one who got in first may confuse being first with being correct. That’s what your claim based on the discovery of a semi-toothed whale “argument” is. Untestable. Unrepeatable. And Evolutionists got in first.

&gt;To prove the predictive power of a system, you have to run a double blind trial wit ha number of events.

&gt;Besides, like Dawkins, you may well say that despite the lack of evidence, juts give Evolution another 50 years and the needed evidence will surface. That’s what he claims about the lack of any known mechanism to generate information out of chance.

&gt;Dawkins does not propose a mechanism for example by which a blind monkey randomly strikes keys on a key board and produces an essay about the evils of people smuggling, in Mongolian. Nor could Dawkins do this, but he wants you to believe that the information contained in the DNA which is hundreds of times more complex than an essay in Mongolian, cam about by blind chance, without the aid of a blind monkey an a word-processor.

&gt;Moreover, as I have said above, Dawkins admits he knows of no way to generate information by random processes. And for this reason, his only suggestion is to just have faith and in the future, we will discover this mechanism.

&gt;If you know of a mechanism to generate information from random events, you might like to inform Professor Dawkins, because he openly states he knows of no such process.

&gt;You made another claim the other day, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism?” Again this is not an argument. I could equally say that Evolutionism is simple Mother Earth God religion relabeled. Neither statement is an argument. 

&gt;You may prefer your statement, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism” to my mathematical argument. 

&gt;But I will ask you again, ”Suppose I have 10 dice. I randomly shake them and throw them onto a table. All come up sixes. I do this again. They all come up sixes again. I do it a third time and they all come up sixes again.” 

&gt;Now you could believe that all this happened by blind chance and indeed it could have. There is 1 chance in 6 to the power 30 of this happening. i.e. 1 chance in 221,073,919,720,733,000,000,000.

&gt;Now, in the second part of the experiment I throw another three lots of 10 dice. And I just get a mixture of numbers, but never the long string of sixes. (Which by the way is what you secretly expected. Not just now but every time I throw 10 dice.You know random produces random. You know that random processes does not produce order.)

&gt;Anyway, so you could either believe that the 30 sixes was a mere chance event but I am sure you would not believe this. I am sure you would be wondering how I fixed the dice or whether I had 10 loaded dice which I secretly swapped for 10 normal dice between the first three throws and the second three throws.

&gt;Yet for any of the so-called simplest life form (there is no simple life form!) to have evolved by dead, blind, chance, you need much greater luck that 30 sixes in a row. Vastly greater luck. You do not believe in 30 dice coming up 6 in a row but you do believe in vastly less likely events. And not just one such event, but countless events where chance produced an eye, a liver, a heart with four chambers, kidneys, skin, bones, a digestive tract…… and by random processes also equipped these organs with the ability to repair themselves.

&gt;So, *****, instead of replying with, “Isn’t Intelligent Design just relabeled Creationism” you might like to propose a mechanism by which information is randomly generated, randomly encoded and then somehow read and understood by another randomly generated system.

&gt;You see, for the monkey to randomly bash away at the keys and write in Mongolian, the language of Mongolian must have been pre-existent and there must have been someone who could read it and decipher it. How else would we know what the monkey was writing was Mongolian, in the regional dialect of NW Mongolia with a few loan words of Siberian thrown in? There must be information existing, then encoded into some method and then the decoding must be done by someone who knows that the writing is information and makes sense if read.

&gt;To believe in Evolution as the source of design information, as Dawkins does is like saying, “The monkey randomly striking keys on a computer, is in fact typing information. He does not know what the information is, since he himself cannot read it and I cannot read it either but I assume it is information somehow. I assume that what the monkey writes is, in reality information, which I will be able to read someday in the future. This must be so since I refuse to accept that there is an Intelligent Designer behind the design.”

 &gt;But Francis Crick let the cat of out the bag on intelligent design.

&gt;""Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved. It might be thought, therefore, that evolutionary arguments would play a large part in guiding biological research, but this is far from the case. It is difficult enough to study what is happening now. To figure out exactly what happened in evolution is even more difficult. Thus evolutionary achievements can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research, but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood."" 1988

&gt;Note that Francis Crick, with all his decades of Noble-prize wining experience,  cannot trust his scientific mind when it tells him what is in front of him is evidence of intelligent design. He must CONTINUALLY remind himself….. So the evidence is so compelling, so convincing that Crick has to CONTINUALLY remind himself tht despite the evidence for Intelligent Design there is no design, only chance. Not once, not now and then, but CONTINUALLY.

&gt;Further, Crick points out:

  &gt;    evolutionary achievements can be used as hints to suggest possible lines of research (Hints are not evidence and certainly not proofs)
      &gt;  but it is highly dangerous to trust them too much. (highly dangerous!)
        &gt; It is all too easy to make mistaken inferences unless the process involved is already very well understood. (He fails to state how often the processes well understood.)
Do you agree with Dawkins, i.e. there are no known methods of producing information from random processes.

&gt;Do you agree with Crick that the Evolution is very poor at predicting anything?

&gt;Do you agree with Crick that the evidence of design has to be continually ignored in order to believe in Evolution?

DebateEvolution,7m6asd,Dzugavili,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationists on Review: ""Out of the Mouth of Babes"" or ""Why Are Fish Still Fish?""","[""Out of the Mouth of Babes: Common Sense About Fish, Fossils, and Evolution""](https://crev.info/2017/12/common-sense-evolution/)

Brief overview: Sal is back, and he dusts off some old favourites pandering to an audience who needs a lot of reassurance but has no intellectual ability to factcheck. In this episode, he asks the favourite ""if man evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" Except in this case, it's man from fish. Let's hit the highpoints of this tiny, tiny little article written by a small, small man.

&gt;Given that a shark can take 18 years to mature, using 20 years as an approximate time for a generational cycle, the “fossil” shark underwent about 400,000 generations and was still a shark! This raises the question why should we expect any fish even after a few million generations to become an eagle as the Darwinists insist is the case?

Because there's such a thing as a niche, and that's what powers evolutionary change: if you're the best basketball player playing the game, you don't retire to play golf. Creatures like sharks are apex predators in the ocean, an environment which pretty much hasn't generated a new niche in a billion years: they don't need to change. The counter example is that many birds fall into [the mammal niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo) when no mammals are around to do so. Similar effects power island gigantism, which is a fun effect where normally small creatures become much larger on islands, where the isolated environment allows them a niche normally that normally excludes them.

Similarly, before there were land-based animals, there were just all these plants, hanging out there, all tasty, on land. No one there to eat it. Seems like something would want to fill that niche. Seems like a good one.

&gt;I spent the last 3 months arguing on the internet with evolutionary biologists including a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Joe Felsenstein. They could never explain why, in light of the evidence of “living fossils,” they would expect after N-generations a fish would be anything other than a fish.

Notice how he hasn't posted the correspondence? I wonder what that looks like.

It seems this isn't the first time he and Felsenstein have sparred. There are traces across the Internet of their previous encounters, and it seems like Sal hasn't picked up any new tricks. I can't find the conversation in question, but I suspect Felsenstein did what I normally do, and simply give up dealing with people who don't understand the simplest of terms when it doesn't agree with Genesis.

Otherwise, I could trivially explain it: there is a genetic difference between fish and non-fish that represent stuff that you need for land. Limbs and lungs come to mind. We can calculate that difference and suggest the minimum number of generations. See, unlike Sal, I understand that mutations happen and genomes change, and thus a fish might not always be a fish, even if most fish are going to remain fish. If a fish develops the full human genome, it's not going to stay a fish.

&gt;Once upon a time, there were these fish called Sarcopterygiians. One of the Sarcopterygiians was a lungfish, one was a coelacanth, and the other had no name—no exact fossil—but remains a missing link to this day.  This missing link called some sort of Tetrapodomorpha (‘four-footed shape’).

[Okay, well, that's a misrepresentation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopterygii#Evolution)

We'll ignore that his pathway of descent isn't great, but *Tetrapodomorpha* isn't missing. We do have examples, there are numerous species found in the fossil record. If you're asking which one is at the root: does it even matter? I've never met your great-grandfather, but I don't imagine your entire family was just magicked into existence.

&gt;So I kept pressing my evolutionary opponents, “why does the lungfish stay a lungfish for hundreds of millions of years, the coelacanth a coelacanth for hundreds of millions of years, yet their sister Sarcopterygiian fish for which we have no fossil, and no exact description, and which you insist erased itself from the planet and left no fossil with a name, that supposedly looked like a fish – why did this mythical fish do something different than its sister fishes and evolve to become tens of thousands of creatures like turtles, parrots and giraffes?” I essentially said, “doesn’t something look amiss to you evolutionists?”

Do you notice he never mentions their replies? He never actually mentions their arguments, he just kind of glosses over the part where they reply.

Nothing is amiss. If the niche is taken, you can't just move into it. That there are animals on already means there are no real benefits to evolving into land dwellers again. So, those 1% that try it, they fail and die. The rest, they stay fish.

&gt;All of this reminded me of an incident a couple of years back. I was invited by some parents in my church to teach their kids about creation. I was explaining to the parents how Darwinists want to poison the kids’ minds by telling them, in essence, “your mommy and daddy came from a fish.” One of the children, a six year-old boy, overheard the conversation and said emphatically, “that’s stupid.”

And now he uses a kid for emotional payload. Good call.

You should get him to write more of your material. I bet he'd come up with fresher material.

At this past November’s Royal Society meeting, “New Trends in Evolutionary Biology,” the distinguished Austrian evolutionary theorist Gerd B. Müller gave the first presentation. As we’ve noted before, it was a devastating one for anyone who wants to think that, on the great questions of biological origins, orthodox evolutionary theory has got it all figured out. Instead, Müller pointed to gaping “explanatory deficits” in the theory. Now the Royal Society’s journal Interface Focus offers a special issue collecting articles based on talks from the conference.

Let’s see what Dr. Müller has to say in an article titled, [“Why an extended evolutionary synthesis is necessary.”](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royfocus/7/5/20170015.full.pdf) A friend highlights the following paragraph, with his own emphasis added.

&gt; As can be noted from the listed principles, **current evolutionary theory** is predominantly oriented towards a genetic explanation of variation, and, except for some minor semantic modifications, this has not changed over the past seven or eight decades. Whatever lip service is paid to taking into account other factors than those traditionally accepted, we find that the theory, as presented in extant writings, concentrates on a limited set of evolutionary explananda, excluding the majority of those mentioned among the explanatory goals above. The theory **performs well with regard to the issues it concentrates on,** providing testable and abundantly confirmed predictions on the dynamics of genetic variation in evolving populations, on the gradual variation and adaptation of phenotypic traits, and on certain genetic features of speciation. If the explanation would stop here, no controversy would exist. **But it has become habitual in evolutionary biology to take population genetics as the privileged type of explanation of all evolutionary phenomena, thereby negating the fact that, on the one hand, not all of its predictions can be confirmed under all circumstances, and, on the other hand, a wealth of evolutionary phenomena remains excluded. For instance, the theory largely avoids the question of how the complex organizations of organismal structure, physiology, development or behavior — whose variation it describes — actually arise in evolution,** and it also provides no adequate means for including factors that are not part of the population genetic framework, such as developmental, systems theoretical, ecological or cultural influences.

DebateEvolution,7m0jcl,Graphitii,Hello There,,self.DebateEvolution,,What You Aren't Being Told About Astronomy: Volume II,"Creation Engineer Spike Psarris continues his video series on creation with this volume. Honestly, it was disappointing. There's no attempt to provide a creationist model. Just poking holes in current theories while playing choir music as he quotes Bible verses. 

Because Astronomers sometimes use the word evolution, Spike claims he can describe cosmological models as evolutionary models. 

While he might get away with this, his constant use of ""secular model"" and ""secular astronomers"" destroy his last shreds of credibility.

He explains the Big Bang with some nice cgi and a neat timeline. While he seems to be accurate as far as I can tell, the graphic reinforces the myth that the Big Bang was an explosion. 

**Star Formation:**

- Clouds of gas don't collapse into stars.

- Gravity cannot overcome gas pressure.

- Unless there is a container, gas will not compress.

- Besides that, there is also: rotation of the gas cloud, turbulent motion, and stray magnetic fields to deal with. 

- Secularists have come up with some explanations to account for this:

- Nearby supernovae compress the gas.

- Interstellar dust cools the gas clouds, reducing pressure.

- Galactic collisions might help. 

- Black hole's jets (the ones on the top and the bottom) hit gas clouds

- Radiation from nearby stars.

- All of these explanations assume the prior existence of stars. 

- New explanations rely on unobservable dark matter and dark energy

- Since we don't know much about this invisible stuff, atheists are free to assign any abilities to it.
**Galactic Formation:**

- Spike goes on to explain why ~~friendship is magic~~ galaxies can't form. 

- There's are a bunch of quotes from astronomers on why their model doesn't work.

- Mature galaxies are found far out. A 500 Million year old mature galaxy allegedly presents a problem for the Big Bang. 

**The Bible and the Universe:**

- Take Genesis literally. 

- Celestial bodies are predicted to have 3 purposes:

- signs and seasons

- sustain life

- declare God's glory.

- The sun is tilted to the plane of the ecliptic, so it can't have formed from a cloud of dust and gas.

- Fine tuning. 

- Stellar variety is not Stellar evolution.

- Blah blah blah dating assumptions something something interpretations. 

- Jeremiah said the stars were uncountable, contrary to the science of his day. We now know that there are 10^22 stars

- But Psalms says that they are finite. 

- The universe is finite. 

- Psalms claims that stars are all different from one another, so it was divinely inspired.

- The universe is huge. 

- Funnily enough, Spike explains what you would see if you were riding on a photon travelling from the sun, going so far as to point out that it would take you 100,000 years to travel across the galaxy. Ironic.

- Distant starlight is reserved for Volume III. 

**Message of the Heavens:**

- Atheists are confused. 

- Christians be like, ""God did it.""

- Evolutionary model fails. 

- Atheism is bleak. 

- Atheists are blind to design.

- Christianity is cheerful.

- Atheism says we are lonely.

- Christianity says we're special. 

- Look! The universe is big!

- Huge!

&gt;Although the ultimate origins of RNA viruses are uncertain, it seems reasonable to assume that these infectious agents have a long evolutionary history, appearing with, or perhaps before, the first cellular life-forms (38). While the RNA viruses we see today may not date back quite this far, the evidence that some DNA viruses have evolved with their vertebrate hosts over many millions of years (24) makes an equally ancient history for RNA viruses a natural expectation. Yet a very different picture of RNA virus origins is painted if their gene sequences are compared; by using the best estimates for rates of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitution) and assuming an approximate molecular clock (21, 33), **it can be inferred that the families of RNA viruses circulating today could only have appeared very recently, probably not more than about 50,000 years ago. Hence, if evolutionary rates are accurate and relatively constant, present-day RNA viruses may have originated more recently than our own species.**

It was somewhat surprising when he lent me a bunch of creationist DVDs, including two on astronomy. 

I asked him about it, and his response was basically, ""I can't answer all your questions on biology and geology, but here's some stuff on astronomy.""

The mind boggles.

Anyway, I watched the first volume today and took notes.

Former Engineer Spike Psarris (All creationists seem to be enigneers these days) was once in the military space program, so he's qualified to speak about such matters. Supposedly. 

The video constantly lambasts ""evolutionists"" for denying the Bible. This, of course ignores that astronomy has nothing to do with evolution. Also, what happened to the theistic evolutionists? Are they okay?

He starts off by defining evolution as everything that disagrees with creation. That was pretty much when my high hopes were dashed.

Under his logic, an old earth model is a secularist model. 

On the Nebular Hypothesis:

- Clumps of dust can't form into planets. Gravity is too weak.

Mercury:

- It's too dense than what evolutionary models predict

- Some scientists have proposed asteroid impacts to account for this. There is no evidence for this. (Note: Spike keeps playing a trumpet every time asteroids are invoked, ridiculing them. In contrast, peaceful, half assed gregorian chants play as he talks about creation. Propaganda.)

- Mercury has a magnetic field, contrary to the dynamo theory. 

- To maintain it, it requires a liquid core.

- But it should have frozen long ago.   

- New models! New problems!

- Mercury has volatile materials, such as lots of sulfur. This contradicts the large impact hypothesis, because they should have been vaporized. 

- The magnetic field is decaying, with a half life of about 320 years. 

- This was predicted by Humphreys.

- Mercury has ""blue hollows"" and escaping volatile materials, contradicting evolutionist's expectations.

- As this is still going on, Mercury must be young.

Venus:

- Despite allegedly forming under similar circumstances as earth, Venus is very, VERY different. 

- Its surface looks young. (Something to do with geologic activity)

- The cratering dating methods used to give an old age rely on flawed assumptions.

Earth:

- Magnetic field is decaying, halving every 1400 yrs. 

- This gives a maximum age of 20,000 years.

- Spike proceeds to ramble on and on about how earth is just perfect for life. 

- He also claims there is enough water in the oceans to cover the earth to a depth of 1.5 miles in the Flood. . . if the surface was smooth.

- Something something marine fossils on mountains.

- The amount of water on earth poses a problem because water can't condense close to the sun. 

- Comet bombardments don't work, because comet ice is abundant in deuterium, while it is rare here on earth.

- Asteroids don't work, because they contain the wrong chemicals and besides, they're mostly rock.

The Moon:

- The moon is placed just right for us to observe eclipses.

- There's something about ""ghost craters."" Not sure what he's talking about.

- If the moon was spun off of earth, the oceans would have boiled off.

- Moon rock is different from earth rock, so the earth and moon couldn't have condensed from the same nebula.

- Earth can't capture an asteroid because it would either hit the earth or just fly away. In other words, moon capture would require narrow paramaters.

- Computer simulations modelling this don't prove anything. 

- The moon has water, which should have been boiled off. 

- The moon is geologically active, which contradicts secularist models.

- Evolutionists adjusted the end of geologic activity on the moon from 3 billion years to 10 million years. Yep, they just can't let go of their millions of years.

- The moon is receding from earth at 3.8 cm per year.

- The figure would have been higher in the past.

- 1.5 billion years ago, the moon would be touching earth.

Mars:

- Evolutionists are hypocrites for claiming Mars was once flooded while mocking creationists. 

- Evolutionists are desperate to find alien life, even though abiogenesis is disproved.

- Wild speculations are taken as fact, to the point that when Spirit runs over a patch of sand, it ""hints at life.""

Jupiter:

- Not enough raw materials to form Jupiter. 

- The planet should have spiralled into the sun because of headwind.

- Argon, Krypton, and Xenon, are three times more abundant than what evolutionists predicted.

- Various rescuing devices, none of them work.

- IO is geologically active, so it must be young. 

- Ganymede has a magnetic field. 

- Evolution predicts stuff will be old, cold, and dead, they aren't

- Europa shows that crater dating is flawed because one impact can cause multiple craters.

Saturn:

- It's rings look weird and are inexplicable.

- An asteroid made them! See the pattern? 

- Saturn's symmetric field contradicts the dynamo theory. 

- Since it can't come from a dynamo, it must be young. 

- [Saturn suffers from the migration problem.](https://www.space.com/2206-death-spiral-theorists-cant-solar-systems.html)

- Enceladus has geysers that should have cooled down by now.

- Titan's methane should have broken down after a short time. 

- Evolutionists predicted vast methane oceans, there aren't any.

- Thousands of craters were predicted. Four were found.

- Janus and Epimetheus, or ""the dancing moons"" are to improbable to have arisen naturally, therefore God.

Uranus:

- Uranus rotates sideways. 

- No evidence of an asteroid impact, blah blah blah. . . 

- It's orbit is stable. 24 moons and a ring, all around the equator. 

- Uranus doesn't radiate energy, although it formed similarly to Jupiter.

- Humphreys predicted its magnetic field.

- Miranda (one of its moons) looks like a patchwork quilt. How do evolutionists explain this? Five asteroid impacts! Trumpet music!

Neptune:

- Neptune isn't old, cold, and dead, as predicted by evolutionists. 

- Accretion is to slow to form Neptune. It would take 10^10 years to form Neptune from a Nebula.

- Evolutionists are motivated to reject the Bible

- It's not Religion vs Science, 300(0?) scientists believe in creation!

Comets and Trans Neptunal Objects:

- TNO's have fresh ice from volcanic eruptions. 

- TNO's are geologically active.

- Oort cloud hasn't been observed, requires faith. 

- How did comet nuclei get so far out into the oort cloud? 

- Not enough nuclei 

- For some reason, the Oort cloud can't supply short period comets (I forgot why, my brain cells were dying.)

- And the Kuiper Belt couldn't have supplied comets.

- The Wild2 comet had the exact opposite composition than what was predicted by evolutionists.

- The Hubble Telescope looked for a predicted 85 comet nuclei. Three were found.

- Evolutionists keep changing their model.

- The Bible was right all along.

DebateEvolution,7linpr,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"RE new study on nervous system evolution: Oh my goodness, has *nobody* on r/creation studied evolution even a little? It's called ""deep homology,"" people.","What's that you say? A group of biologists think we need to revise how we think [central nervous systems evolved](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-08325-y)? Oh wow that's really interest...what? [You think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7lhw4g/yet_another_major_revision_tiny_sea_creatures/) this is a strike against evolutionary theory? Oh, bless your hearts. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the deal. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's this thing called *[deep homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_homology)*. It's when widely divergent organisms share the same trait, but not due to that trait being present in their common ancestor (this is called an *analogous trait*). But, for these traits, the same *genetic pathway* leads to the development of the trait in both lineages, which was inherited from their common ancestor (i.e. is homologous). So while the trait itself isn't homologous, the underlying developmental pathways *are*. Again, this is called *deep homology*.

&amp;nbsp;

This is *extremely* common. Here are two examples:

[Limb development in mammals and insects.](https://i.imgur.com/kJJDMUp.png)

[Eye development in everything that has eyes.](https://i.imgur.com/CWg3PdD.jpg) 

&amp;nbsp;

Oh look we [already knew the pathways involved for central nervous systems, too.](https://i.imgur.com/DnioEfK.png) Now we just know *more* about how CNSs evolved in different lineages. 

&amp;nbsp;

Only to creationists can more evidence about how something evolved be evidence *against* evolutionary theory.

(Also, isn't this, like, what creationists want? A detailed account of how something evolves from A to Z? Now we figure out a big piece of the puzzle and all of the sudden it's ""evolutionary theory called into question the sky is falling!"" Almost like they don't care about the facts, and just twist everything to oppose a theory they don't like.)

&amp;nbsp;

And one last addendum: The anti-evolution respondents so far on r/creation are arguing that this just shows how evolutionary theory isn't falsifiable. That isn't true.

DebateEvolution,7l87ai,preferpaleo,Former Creationist (with a goal to learn all I never got to),,self.DebateEvolution,,(Important) Question about the spiral galaxy argument. One of the TOP TEN creationist arguments.,"I have been researching and dissecting the ""spiral galaxy argument"" often made by creationists. I have a few questions about spiral galaxies if you guys wouldn't mind answering them.

The spiral galaxy argument is explained in a [post] (http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CE/CE380.html) by talk.origns.""Stars closer to the center of a spiral galaxy orbit the galaxy faster than stars farther away. Over many millions of years, the difference in orbital rates should wind the spiral tighter and tighter. We do not see any evidence for this in galaxies of different ages."" This is called the winding up problem. The solution to this is density waves and this [article] (https://biologos.org/blogs/guest/are-spiral-galaxies-evidence-against-an-old-universe) from Biologos explains why the spiral galaxy argument is wrong.

So while researching this argument I have come across an answers in genesis [article] (https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/cosmology/galaxies-unexplained-spirals/) which states: ""Most astronomers currently think that this dark matter may allow galaxies’ spirals to survive. However, the best evidence for dark matter—the higher-than-expected rotation of the outer portions of galaxies—may actually make the winding problem worse, not better.""

I cannot understand why they say this. Why does dark matter make it worse? I am simply confused by their argument.

Besides, this [article](http://www.astronomy.com/news/2013/04/new-insights-on-how-spiral-galaxies-get-their-arms) states that ""The spiral arms are self-perpetuating, persistent, and surprisingly long-lived."" The article also says, the spiral arms of galaxies, ""can exist on their own through (the influence of) gravity, even in the extreme when the perturbations are no longer there."" So based off this research, spiral galaxies could survive on their own without dark matter. Correct?

Let's take a look at each top-level response, shall we?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm omitting a few that are either just links, don't present an argument, or are copied from the earlier thread on this topic. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Radioactive ""dating"" is actually in the creationist camp now. ...hydroplate theory. 

No. And also, everything would be dead.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Creation science has lots of confirmed predictions. One of which, the prediction of planetary magnetic fields, I posted yesterday on the crosspost and got almost entirely responses along the lines of ""but, creationism can't be science by definition, confirmed quantified predictions don't matter!""

This was pretty well hashed out in the other thread. No evidence for an alternative explanation. Just throwing stones. False dichotomy, if you want to be technical.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You want evidence for something? Do eye-witness accounts count as evidence? Then you have the Bible as evidence of creation.

Hahahaha good one. 

No, I don't have a more sophisticated counterargument. ""The Bible is the literal truth"" is the topic for debate. Assuming it is true isn't going to fly. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;[long copy-paste of another user] - no junk DNA, different phylogenies for different genes, redundancy in genomes.

None of these are evidence *for* creation. Additionally, none of them are valid. 

There is junk DNA.

We know why different genes have different phylogenies. I literally devote a full class period to this topic every summer. 

Redundancy is expected via evolutionary processes, particularly gene and genome duplications. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Fine tuning argument.

Will there be anything new in these posts? Not yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;For me, it’s the fact that there are lots of fossilized dead things laid down by flood all over the globe: plesiosaurs in Nebraska, seashells in the Grand Canyon, etc., which to me is evidence of the Genesis Flood.

Never heard of plate tectonics, I guess. 

&amp;nbsp;

And the best, most honest answer in the thread:

&gt;The Bible and the word of Jesus. What else do you need?

If you say that those organisms were *n*ot irreducibly complex - then we should be able to have even more simpler organisms and have darwinian evolution act upon it and produce novel functions.

And even more simpler organisms to the point they don't fit into the description of an organism.

So now we have non living material and evolutionary mechanism should be able to make it into living organisms.

To sum it up, **you admit irreducible complexity of simple primordial organisms when you leave abiogenesis out of Darwinian evolution.**

For example we have bilatarians which branched off into Nephrozoans, which branched off into deutersomes which branched off into chordata which eventually became vertebrates, then fish-like animals, then fish-like animals with lungs, then fish-like animals with lungs and appendages, and so on until they lived on land and so on until we get to mammal-like reptiles then mammals then primates and well you get the drift. 

Im looking for something with a specific roadmap through the clades with examples of basal forms within that clade and details about what major new trait was modified or formed to create the new clade, so that I can show a gradual step by step process from worm-like animals to fully formed humans. 

My purpose is to show creationists how evolution is just gradual modifications of pre-existing structures, and if we follow these gradual modifications step by step, it eventually leads to humans. For example, we have mostly spineless fish without jaws (like hagfish) who eventually evolve so that one of their ribs gets folded allowing them to open and close their mouth, or how bat wings are literally just modified hands with webbed fingers which creates a wing. Or how horse hooves are just modified and enlarged single digits. Its easier to explain to creationists that evolution makes small changes and adaptations to already existing structures because most creationists already believe that, so if I can show them the gradual modifications of structures from the first forms of life to humans then I think we can maybe change some people's minds and educate people that evolution doesnt take faith at all and can be explained.

- Keep removing parts to test if the flagella could have evolved. (I’m aware that this assumes constant selective pressure, but I wasn’t really in the mood)

I presented him with images of hominid skulls and requested his response.

- To show that they were missing links, you have to find them in the same area, say 100 or 1000 km apart. However, it’s not convincing if they’re 10,000 km apart. 

- Were they subjectively reconstructed? How much is original bone?

- The skulls were all apes or all men, in other words, variation in a man kind or ape kind. (He pointed out all the variation in churchmember’s skulls as evidence.)

- Lining up skulls does not prove common ancestry. 

As a follow up to my claims regarding human vestigial organs  being vestiges of previous organs (duh) he asked for examples. Unfortunately, I had failed in this regard. 

I told him about bacteria eating nylon.

- Discovering new enzymes doesn’t mean they evolved. Just because you can eat pizza doesn’t mean you evolved to eat it. 

- Prove that they can’t eat non nylon stuff. (Why he asks this is beyond me)

DebateEvolution,7ke1nl,justpickanameman,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Question about intermediate forms,"Hi Reddit, 

I’m not here to debate you. I’m just here because I have a question I want to know more about!

I’ve learnt that geologist have found fossils in the ground, in the order of simple to more complex and/or in the order of different to more like the animals we see today (fish without bones, fish with bones, land animals, mammals). I agree this seems like the animals evolved from their primitive form. 

If this is indeed the case, we can assume that the animals changed gradually (maybe not with the same speed, but in relative terms). Now imagine we have a specie (I can’t be specific because I have not much knowledge on the matter, but I’m sure there’s one that fits my description), which we call B. Specie B is still alive today. We assume that B has an ancestral specie, which we call specie A. This animal is extinct today. 

Because A differs much from B (although they share traites, which suggestie them to be related) we would have to assume that there had been a lot of organisms between A and B that looked like both but gradually changed from A to B. We will call this group of morphing species, specie X. 

Now if the above is all the case, would we have to find *at least* an equal amount of X than as of A, right? Would this situation also require us to find more of X than of A? 

My second question is: if the above is the case, do geologists find the same when looking for intermediate forms? Do they find more/less of ‘specie A’ or more/less from ‘specie X’?",19,1513521081,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7ke1nl/question_about_intermediate_forms/

However, those mutations that beset DNA are far more diverse than point mutations, and if we account for this vastly wider range of mutations, protein fold evolution becomes largely explicable.""

Meyer does discuss mechanisms such as exon shuffling, gene duplication and chimeric genes in the chapter ""Assume A Gene"".

This user also claimed that the creation subreddit was not an echo chamber because they don't do those things, plus, ""evolutionists"" are allowed to post there.

Science only thrives when there is room for new ideas and for criticism of any and all ideas. Good, valid ideas can withstand even the harshest of criticism; bad ideas get discarded if they fail to live up to basic scientific methodology. Much like this subreddit, no idea is so sacred that someone can't criticize it with valid points.

I perused the creation subreddit and found several posts that reveal just how much of a hugbox the other subreddit is. It's a location where people know they can run and post criticism of science that knowledgeable people cannot respond. It's where they know that their posts will get them pats on the back for being smart, just for posting something that agrees with their beliefs.

DebateEvolution,7i8nu9,Itsdemtitans,"Geology Nerd, Former YEC now Evolutionist ",,self.DebateEvolution,,A Buried Landscape: Burying the Flood,"Alright, as promised, here's my follow up to the surprise canyon formation post. Here we will discuss an entire buried landscape, and it's implications for Flood Geology. 

YEC Andrew Snelling lists [a lack or erosion](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/grand-canyon-facts/no-slow-and-gradual-erosion/) in the geologic record as one of the top six pieces of evidence for a Global Flood. To quote:

 &gt;If the fossil-bearing layers took hundreds of millions of years to accumulate, then we would expect to find many examples of weathering and erosion after successive layers were deposited. The boundaries between many sedimentary strata should be broken by lots of topographic relief with weathered surfaces. After all, shouldn’t millions of years worth of weathering and erosion follow each deposition?

&gt;On the other hand, the cataclysmic global Flood described in Genesis 7–8 would lead us to expect something much different. Most of the fossil-bearing layers would have accumulated in just over one year. Under such catastrophic conditions, even if land surfaces were briefly exposed to erosion, such erosion (called sheet erosion) would have been rapid and widespread, leaving behind flat and smooth surfaces. The erosion would not create the localized topographicrelief (hills and valleys) we see forming at today’s snail’s pace. **So, if the Genesis Flood caused the fossil-bearing geologic record, then we would only expect evidence of rapid or no erosion at the boundaries between sedimentary strata.**

(**my emphasis**)

This statement from Snelling gives us two crucial admissions from the creationists. First, surface topography in the rock record would exist if the rocks really were millions of years old. However, the Flood, by YEC's own admission, could NOT form such features. If we find ANY surface topography in the middle of their ""Flood"" deposits, then their flood didn't happen. 

So, do we find only flat boundaries between layers? Nope. Surface erosion abound in the rock record. Using Seismic imaging, we can create 3-D images of the rock's beneath our feet. Vibrations are sent down into the Earth, and when they hit rocks of a different composition, some come back, just like an ultrasound. When these are fed into a computer, some very interesting features are observed. My favorite example is provided [here](https://media.nature.com/full/nature-assets/ngeo/journal/v4/n8/images_article/ngeo1191-f2.jpg)

The picture comes from a paper by [Hartley et al](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Events/Past-Meeting-Resources/Poetry-and-Geology-A-Celebration/~/media/Files/GSL/shared/pdfs/library/Geopoetry/Hartley-et-al-2011.ashx), who found an entire ancient landscape, dating to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. This deeply incised landscape is cut into the 58.5–56-Myr-old Lamba formation, which consists of marine deltaic deposits whose flat topset units were deposited at sea level. This formation is largely unreflective and consists of mudstones and siltstones with occasional thin sandy layers. The eroded landscape has been infilled by the 2 56–54.5 Myr Flett and Balder formations. 

Not only does this run directly contrary to the predictions of Flood geology, it has several features present that are not expected if, magically, this somehow formed underwater. For one, observe the incision patterns. It features a branching dendritic pattern, which is charictaristic of terrestrial erosion, not submarine. I emailed Dr. Hartley for clarification on this, and he said: 

&gt;You're absolutely correct that the dendritic drainage patterns are characteristic of terrestrial river erosion, while submarine canyons can sometimes have similar patterns it would be unusual, particularly over such length scales.

So at the scale we're measuring, we can safely rule out this just being coincidentally formed underwater. Furthermore, the formation contains fossil soil horizons known as paleosols, along with coal and pollen. YECs, of course, dispute paleosols (for refutations of their claims, see [here](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/oard-2011/vega) ). But what are the chances that the flood would really deposit Coal, forge what seem to paleosols, and carve a landscape with things that just *look like* terrestrial drainage patterns all in the same place at the same time? 

An ounce of common sense shows this to be less than implausible. This story was all over the news in 2012, yet the YEC ministries didn't let out so much as a peep. I wonder why?

DebateEvolution,7i8j1j,Itsdemtitans,"Geology Nerd, Former YEC now Evolutionist ",,self.DebateEvolution,,"The Surprise Canyon Formation: A not-so-little ""surprise"" for Flood Geology","Hey all, 

So, as requested by /u/Denisova, here I will present my favorite piece of evidence against a global flood: The Surprise Canyon Formation. 

The Surprise Canyon Formation in the Grand Canyon is a spectacular example of a geologic feature which is inconsistent with Flood Geology. This formation is located in the grand canyon and consists of filled in channels cut into the Redwall Limestone. The erosional valleys form a stream network which becomes wider and deeper in a westerly direction, with the deepest measuring 401 feet. 

All kinds of fascinating fossils have been found in the Surprise Canyon Formation -- brachiopods (22 species), corals, bryozoans, mollusks (including univalves), echinoderms (i.e., starfish), and plant fossils. Fossils trees and logs have been found near the bottom, along with spores. The further up one goes, a transition from terrestrial to marine fossils is seen.

At the bottom of the paleovalleys filled with the Surprise Canyon Formation, a layer of conglomerate if found. The large rocks in the conglomerate are chunks of solid Redwall Limestone. We know their identity because, when these rocks are broken open, they contain fossils native to the Redwall, and not the Surprise Canyon Formation's own sediments. This means the Redwall must have already been solid when erosion occurred and the conglomerate formed. 

So what sequence of events would have to take place for the Surprise Canyon Formation to be formed?  First, you'd have to deposit the Redwall Limestone, have it lithify, then have the entire area uplifted at least 400 feet.  Then, the westward trending stream/valley network could be cut into the Redwall Limestone. Later, the entire area would have to be flooded by an advancing sea from the west (hence the marine fossils in upper portions of the formation). Later, the layers of the Supai Group would be deposited, starting with the Watahomigi Formation.  Then, after that, the rest of the Grand Canyon Layers.

Young Earth Creationists often point out that erosional features and buried surface topography should be found in the geologic record if it were formed over Millions of years. The Surprise Canyon Formation is an excellent example of this. But can YECs explain its existence? No. They've tried but they can't.

The only YEC I've seen to address the channels of the SCF is [Ariel Roth.](https://www.slideshare.net/arielroth/gc-1-reading) Roth merely calls on scouring of the still soft Redwall by underwater currents, which were then filled in. To quote:

&gt;Such suggestions tend to ignore the expectations of channel carving for Flood models.


In principal, sure, a flood could carve channels, maybe even deep channels. However, the idea that it could carve the SCF channels is falsified by the conglomerates at the base of the formation containing chunks of Redwall Limestone. Had the Redwall been soft, a mixing of sediments would be foreseeable, but chunks of rock already hardened to be eroded up? Not a chance.

YEC Emil Silvestru was the only other YEC to Address the conglomerate. His explanation? [Straight denial.](http://evolutionfairytale.com/forum/index.php?/topic/4928-questions-concerning-the-global-flood-models/page-2)

&gt;""As for the conglomerate with Redwall clasts, I need to see pictures and thin section identification of the clasts (confirming them being Redwall Limestone).""

Plenty of pictures [exist online.](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/40ce0536f8674824b4278a07b068bfa7/grand-canyon-trail-of-time-surprise-canyon-conglomerate-ha2dgm.jpg) 

As for thin sections specifically, I don't know if they were done. Likely they were, but they are not required to demonstrate their identity. We know that these rocks are from the Redwall because when you break into one of the chunks, they contain fossils unique to the Redwall, not native sediments of the Surprise Canyon Formation. Other analysis shows that the conglomerate chunks match the Surprise Canyon Formation in every way (See Billingsley, G. H. and Beus, S. S. eds., 1999, *Geology of the Surprise Canyon Formation of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, Museum of Northern Arizona Bulletin 61.* for details. This can be hard to get, I had to visit the Museum of North Arizona just to look at it, but it wasn't for sale. I'm still trying to get a copy in my hands.) The information is there, Silvestru just opted to outright deny it instead looking. Nice. 

So what are we left with? We have the remnants of a vast westward-draining river system preserved in the grand canyon. It's layers show a peaceful transition from land to marine life, and provide definitive proof the lower layers were hardened before incision took place. This runs directly counter to the predictions of Flood Geology, which predicts something like this couldn't exist. But it does. 

My next post will show an entire *buried landscape* which features the same problem.

DebateEvolution,7hc1b7,Sciencequestions3,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Question about Evolution,"Hello Reddit,


I have a question about evolution. I am not a biologist by any means so I may be approaching this completely wrong but I have a background in electronics. So I am approaching this from a coding perspective. I was thinking about what the chance of the simplest DNA coming about is. So assuming that the essential ingredients for DNA are present and able to self-combine and assuming that this is a completely random process. The simplest know organism that I could find on google was a Nasuia deltocephalinicola which has 137 genes or 112,000 base pairs. Okay heres where the math starts


112,000 base pairs so that’s 224000 nucleobases. And each nucleobase can be 5 different bases (adenine, cyosine, guane, thymine, uracil)


So looking at this as coming about randomly wouldn’t that give you a chance of 1 in 5^224000 chance of happening? After realizing that that’s a big number (1.91x10^156569) I wanted to estimate how long that would take to happen. So I then hypothesised what if life can guess 1 trillion times a day so 1x10^9 guesses/day…that seems like a lot but hey this is all hypothetical. So we get


1.91x10^156569/1x10^9= 1.91x10^156560 days


That seemed crazy to me so I was wondering could that fit in the known length of the universe. The universe is estimated at 13.8 billion years. So let’s do some more math


((1.91x10^156560) days / 365days/year)/13.8 billion years= 3.79x10^156547 Universe lengths


That seems impossible to me… but as we know it could happen possibly. So let’s continue and assume this happened. The next simplest organism that I could find is a Carsonella Ruddii at 182 genes or 159662 base pairs. So assuming that this organism inherited all the previous genes (probably not the case but let’s just for assumptions sake) so 319324 nucleobases - 224000 nucleobases = 95324 “new” nucleobases so that gives a chance of 1 in 5^95324. After realizing that this is another very large number it got me thinking wouldn’t each mutation make it more and more less likely? For example let’s assume that this happened. So the chance of the first DNA happening is 1 in 1.91x10^156569 and the chance of the next mutation is 1 in 4.14x10^66628. So to get the chance of both of these we would need to times them 1.91x10^156569 x 4.14x10^66628 equals 7.91x10^223197.


So here’s my question wouldn’t these compounding chances make the life we see now impossible in 13.8 billions years (the known length of the universe)? What am I doing wrong? Is my math wrong? Am I looking at this wrong? How do we answer this?

DebateEvolution,7h6eso,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationists just can't let carbon dating go,"/u/ChristianConspirator in this [thread](htts://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7goenu/carbon_dating_of_methuselah/)  in /r/creation is yet again making a mess from radiocarbon dating despite the attempts by /u/dzugavili to make him understand how it actually works.

So what do we got here.

&gt; When talking to evolutionists about dendrochronology they love to point to carbon calibration, particularly IntCal13, to suggest that the earth is old (More data here).

Sorry dude but radiocarbon dating *isn't* use to date the age of the earth. Its range, up to 50,000, in some occasions possibly 60,000 years does not suffice for geological purposes. We don't use medical thermometers in ovens to see if the meat is well baked.

Hence, radiocarbon dating is mostly applied in history science or archaeology.

&gt; So what's wrong with Methuselah? I have heard, though I've looked and cannot verify, that dating the oldest parts of these trees gives carbon dates that are erratic...

Carbon dating is *principally* not suited for dating living objects. It is explicitly excluded from from the list of applicable specimens for crucial methodological reasons. Only deceiving creationists who have not the slightest idea of what they tattle about, are the ones who manage to still date living objects with radiocarbon dating.

I think you should get yourself more knowledgeable about the things you deal with, don't you think?

But, actually, radiocarbon dating indeed has yielded abundantly all kinds and types of archaeological specimens to be older than 6,500 years. So it does falsify the 6,500 year old earth caboodle from the bible. Along with more than *hundred* other dating techniques (to be found [here](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/category/from-stars-to-stalagmites/age-of-earth/), [here](https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/100-reasons-the-earth-is-old-reblogged-from-age-of-rocks/) and [here](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evidence_against_a_recent_creation)) that independently have found literally thousands of specimens of all sorts and nature to be older than 6,500 years. The idea of a 6,500 years earth is completely shot into pieces.

&gt; Obviously, when dead trees (without a witnessed death date) are used, there are assumptions involved that any young earth creationist would not accept. 

Of course ""just"" mention something like ""there are assumptions involved that any young earth creationist would not accept"" and then don't mention which ones exactly let alone explain and prove that these are to be discarded by flaws.

So, WHAT assumptions exactly?

&gt; that any young earth creationist would not accept"" ...

WHO CARES.

&gt; For example many of the trees are dated by the fact that they were buried in the Younger-Dryas event, which I believe is dated using ice cores. 

The end of the Younger Dryas has been dated by by a variety of methods with consistent results, including GRIP1 (11,500 year years before present) and GRIP2 (11,640 years ybp) ice core isotope measurements in Greenland, varved sediments from lake Krakenes (Norway, 11,530 ybp), Cariaco Basin core (Venezuela, 11,570 ybp) and German oak/pine dendrochronology (11,570 ybp as well).

Isn't it just be wonderful how calibration works, don't you agree?

Which BTW was not in my &gt; 100 list of falsifications of a 6,500 years old earth, so now it's &gt; 100 +1.

&gt; Whenever possible, you would think it would be more straightforward to use living trees, and there are two that I know of not too far from each other, along with a third that was cut down in the 60s.

Not particularly, other dating techniques are also valid and reliable. But, anyway, the end of the Younger Dryad *has* been measured using dendrochronological cross-dating, see the German oak/pine specimen above.

Your post is straight GARBAGE.

If I understand this paper well (the technical details of which are way over my head), the authors have succeeded in adding an extra “unnatural” base pair to the DNA of a strain of e. coli, resulting in a bacterium having 6 types of nucleotides instead of 4 like all other (known) organisms. 

Not only was the new code transcribed into mRNA and tRNA, ultimately a completely new protein not found in nature was synthesised.

How do you interpret these results in the light of the creationist dogma that adding new information to the genome is impossible?

I watched this whole video. It was painful. 

The claim here is that genetics supports the notion that all of humanity is descended from the survivors of Noah’s flood, which occurred about 4400 years ago, give or take.  

No. 

Let’s see what claims are made by this purported expert and how they measure up. 

&amp;nbsp;

Starts by presupposing that the Bible accurately tells the history of the universe. That’s the starting point. 

&amp;nbsp;

Eight and a half minutes in, and there has been nothing of substance. Just going over the years of the flood and Babel, and estimating population sizes, an exercise that is completely arbitrary, by their own admission. 

&amp;nbsp;

Okay we’re twelve minutes in, and it’s all about population growth so far. Nothing about genetics, genetic diversity, etc. Just arguing that we can get seven billion people since the flood. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ah, here we go. Predictions: “1 Y (male) ancestor” and “1 mtDNA (female) ancestor”. 

Not a good start. That’s not what those things mean. We can determine the time to the Y-MRCA and the mtMRCA, but those are *not* single male and female ancestors of all extant humans. They are *only* the MRCAs for the Y chromosome and the mtDNA. That’s *it*. The rest of the genome has many other MRCAs. For example, the X chromosome MRCA lived [about half a million years ago](http://zums.ac.ir/files/genetics/test/seq_variation_in_a_non_coding_region_of_hx_chr_(1999\)_kaessmann_et_al.pdf), compared to 200 to 300 thousand years for the Y-MRCA, and even more recently for the mtMRCA. And he doesn’t even mention the disparities in the dates; just lies about what the terms mean and moves on. And yes, lies, since this guy claims to be an expert.

&amp;nbsp;

Prediction: Only two alleles per locus (since it all came from Adam, so if he’s heterozygous, only two alleles per locus. This is…not the case. I mean…wha?

&amp;nbsp;

Prediction: Dispersal of humans around the world all at once. Nope. It took at least 40 thousand years to get from leaving Africa to entering the Americas, for example. He also hilariously leaves out all the stuff about originating in Africa. He just handwaves that away.

Anything else?

&amp;nbsp;

Well, apparently completely without self-awareness, we get the claim that a human bottleneck with an effective population size of about 10 thousand would mean humans went extinct. No mention of how we survived a bottleneck of N=6 post-flood. 

&amp;nbsp;

And now there’s an absurd simulation showing how you go from having every allele present at 50%, to a situation where most loci are fixed. (He hilariously misinterprets some data here, apparently not understanding what “allele frequency” means, but whatever.) The simulation he uses shows what happens when genetic drift is driving changes in allele frequencies. It’s just modeling random fluctuations in a small population. That’s literally it. He then says “woah, this matches what we should see if the Bible was true! &lt;mindblown&gt;” 

&amp;nbsp;

OH MAN THEN HE GOES TO GENETIC ENTROPY. It’s like he’s trying to be wrong in every way all at once. 

[Nope.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/)

(Special shout-out to the Sanford flu paper. AMA about that paper. It’s *terrible*. Assumes constant fitness landscape, a single selective pressure, no interaction between flu strains, etc. Oh my goodness it’s terrible.)

&amp;nbsp;

Aaaaaaand that’s all, folks. Those are the genetic “arguments” for a literal creation and flood story. Ooof. What a sorry exercise.  

&amp;nbsp;

Creationists, do you really take this stuff seriously? This is a 26 minute video with in which *almost no* empirical claims are made. Those few that are made are egregiously wrong.

The ""experts,"" at least, should know better.","[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/7bm32d/the_excellent_though_unintentional_argument_for/) brought my attention to [this 1997 paper,](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14126594_A_high_observed_substitution_rate_in_the_human_mitochondrial_DNA_control_region) which was cited as evidence of a recent Biblical Eve by Dr. Georgia Purdom, one of several creationist con-artists selling her credentials to give credence to scientifically absurd ideas. The TLDR version is that the authors found that according to their methodology, the human mitochondrial most recent common ancestor existed 6500 years ago, in contrast to the generally-accepted date range of about 1-300kya. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are a bunch of reasons why these findings do not actually show this, and I want to first say that one can't fault random people on r/creation for not knowing that's the case or realizing why. Dr. Purdom is an expert, the authors are experts, why should one question the findings?

&amp;nbsp;

But Dr. Purdom should know better than to peddle shoddy work like this. Here's why you can't take that number at face value:

1. The used something called RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis to calculate the observed mutation rate. But this type of analysis ropes in more than just single-nucleotide substitutions (i.e. one base becomes another). Insertions and deletions can also lead to differences in RFLP. But we calculate convergence dates based on single-nucleotide changes, so this technique leads to a significant over-count of number of mutations that occur per unit time or per generation. 

2. They included in their analysis a region of the mitochondrial genome that does not show a constant mutation rate over time. But the goal, the thing we're doing here, is called molecular clock analysis. To work, the regions under analysis have to accumulate mutations at an approximately constant rate over the time interval of interest. Including a region that violates this principle invalidates the results. 

3. The design of this study fails to account for a phenomenon called heteroplasmy, which is when an individual inherits more than one mitochondrial genotype from their mother. This raises the *measured* mutation rate, but only because some mutations are double-counted. 

&amp;nbsp;

Subsequent studies using more careful techniques and more comprehensive datasets indicate an mtMRCA 150-200kya. This single outlier study is an enormous outlier because the techniques they used were not appropriate to address the question. [More details here](http://www.evolutionpages.com/Mitochondrial%20Eve.htm) if one is so inclined. 

&amp;nbsp;

And creationists who accept what people like Purdom and Jeanson at face value should be offended that these supposed experts will lie to them, using data that *they know is not valid*, because with their credentials, they will be believed, and those invalid data support the preconceptions of their audience. Shameful dishonesty on their part. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are some other problems with the OP on r/creation, but I'll let those slide for now, with one exception:

&gt;The reality of Mitochondrial Eve, that ancient female from whom all living humans have descended

That's not what Mitochondrial Eve is. mtEve is the *mitochondrial* MRCA. All extant *mitochondrial genomes* are descended from mtEve's mitochondrial genomes. But other parts of the genome are descended from other people, and there were lots of other people alive at the time, many of whom have extant descendants. mtEve represents the MRCA for just a small part of the DNA in each of our cells.

I'm reading a generally horrid and frustrating book right now called *Total Truth* by Nancy Pearcey.  It may come as a shock to you that a book containing Intelligent Design apologetics is actually a book about  having a conservative Christian worldview and fighting back against the inherently evil and misguided claims of secular culture.  I go to an awfully conservative Christian university where this book is a required reading.  I'm an *""evolutionist""* and an agnostic if it matters, just to be clear.  So big mistake on my part.  

Pearcey has a chapter in this book called Darwin Meets the Berenstain Bears* where she moves from demonstrating the commitment of scientific communities to the theory of evolution (no surprises there) to citing a few examples of where she thinks evolution does not stand up to scrutiny.  I'm wanting to get some better-informed opinions on these examples so I can completely and utterly destroy them in my book review and really piss off my professor.  I'm particularly looking for thoughts on points 1, 3 and 5 as the others are pretty rudimentary and basically just me ranting/thinking out loud.

Here they are:

1.  **Darwin's Beaks**: I think(?) this is an easy one but I want to give you a feel for what we're dealing with.  Pearcey basic transcribes this passage from Phillip Johnson's WSJ article,  [The Church of Darwin](http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/chofdarwin.htm) -

  &gt; Here's just one example of how real science is replaced by flim-flam. The standard textbook example of natural selection involves a species of finches in the Galapagos, whose beaks have been measured over many years. In 1977 a drought killed most of the finches, and the survivors had beaks slightly larger than before. The probable explanation was that larger-beaked birds had an advantage in eating the last tough seeds that remained. A few years later there was a flood, and after that the beak size went back to normal. Nothing new had appeared, and there was no directional change of any kind. Nonetheless, that is the most impressive example of natural selection at work that the Darwinists have been able to find after nearly a century and a half of searching.  

 She later mentions the HIV mutation scenario where the virus became resistant to drugs given a certain amount of time.  When the drugs were removed the changes were reserved, and to quote she says: 
 
 &gt; Such limited, reversible change is hardly evidence for a theory that requires *un*limited, directional change.

2.  **Dysfunctional Fruit Flies**: This is a pretty common objection to evolution I hear at my uni, which is that evolution can explain the *survival* but not the *arrival* of the fittest.  Pearcey refers to mutations in fruit flies that never actually *benefit* the fly such as bigger wings, smaller wings, no wings, four wings, etc.  She then posits that while these mutations are occurring, none of them are bringing *Musca domestica* anywhere in a macroevolutionary sense.  Talk Origins has a good rebuttal [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB101_2.html), but if anyone has any other examples, that'd be great.

3.  **Doctored Moths**:  This sections refers to the [Peppered Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution#Religious_controversy) controversy.  I'm not sure why Pearcey focuses so much on this experiment but I'd be curious to see if folks here validate the experiment or choose to focus on others.

4.  **Most Famous Fake**:  Pearcey uses this section to cast doubt on Haeckel's famous [embryo drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_drawing#Haeckel.27s_proponents_.28past_and_present.29).  She is also anxious to point out that Haeckel was, in fact, a racist and supported eugenics.  Nevertheless, even contemporaries like Stephen Jay Gould state that Haeckel's drawings are ""inaccurate and falsified.""  Again, Talk Origins offers a concise but effective [rebuttal.](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB701.html)

5.  **Science Strictly Presupposes Naturalism**:  Ironically, this book is assigned reading for a philosophy class.  Not a surprise that a quasi-theologian popularizer doesn't seem to know much about science.  She quotes Dawkins:

 &gt; Even if there were no actual evidence in favor of the Darwinian theory . . . we would still be justified in preferring it over all rival theories.

 Now I'd suspect that this quote is taken out of context ([it was](https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/09/dembski-quote-m.html)).  Pearcey is, in part, trying to illustrate a supposed dogmatic commitment to evolutionary theory in the scientific community and uses all the above examples to show the eagerness of scientists to accept even shoddy evidence for evolution.  What are your thoughts on this charge?  It seems to me that evolution has gone through a lot of deserved changes in light of new evidences or hypotheses, but I'm no expert.  I also don't think that evolution contradicts religion despite my own views on metaphysics.

6. **Darwinism is a Religion**:  This claim just frustrated me and I don't think it requires explaining because it's silly.  The very man that creationists use to support this statement, scientist Michael Ruse, writes that: 

 &gt; ""Today's professional evolutionism is no more a secular religion than is industrial chemistry.""

That's the gist of it.  The biggest issue with the chapter in general is that Pearcy flagrantly ignores a lot of undisputed, positive evidence for evolution.  Furthermore, despite giving no positive evidence in favor of Intelligent Design, she goes to insist that it deserves an audience in the classroom and that it's silly to think the debate over our origins is over.  I think a big part of this chapter is trying to demonstrate ""reasonable doubt"" regarding evolutionary theory and I was curious what you guys would think about the specific examples I listed.  She does goes on to defend Intelligent Design in the next chapter ironically dubbed *The Science of Common Sense,* so if you're into being annoyed and underwhelmed, have [fun](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Truth-Study-Guide-Christianity/dp/1433502208).  Thanks everyone.

Edit: should've copied the comment here:


&gt;""I left because intelligent design isn’t real"" lol. Hey, I took a decent amount of lectures on evolutionary biology and I would be willing to debate this. I am not your average creationist who tries to disprove evolution by using the bible or the Quran lol. But bring forth the evidence you believe exclusively supports evolution and lets' debate.

&gt;My proposition is that 5 out of 7 evolutionary predictions as written in the origin of species are false and that the final 2 predictions being homology and comparative DNA is compatible with creation theory.

&gt;1 - fossil record - [fail](http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/science/origin/04-cambrian-explosion.php)  even though [most life in pre-cambarian could fossilize and it was very very simple life even plenty were unicellular ](http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/precambrian.html), and post-cambarian was littered with complex life. No intermediate fossils between simple life and complex life = no evolution  or hoax evidence like piltdown man, nebraska man, peking man, etc. Trying to use undefinitive fossils to prove evolution thus becomes a formal logical fallacy called the [texas sharpshooter fallacy.](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/175/Texas-Sharpshooter-Fallacy)

&gt;2- comparative embryology  like [this](http://photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/56/102/92821651_XS.jpg) prediction, [fail](http://www.ichthus.info/Evolution/PICS/Richardson-embryos.jpg). In fact terrible [fail.](http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Haeckel--fraud%20not%20proven.pdf)

&gt;3- vestgials, horrible fail. Every single vestigial have found their function. We are only down to one, wisdom teeth. Even [appendix](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-function-of-the-human-appendix-did-it-once-have-a-purpose-that-has-since-been-lost/) and [coccyx](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/coccyx)  were knocked down. Some have tried to salvage this by saying ""vestigial =/= useless"" but that is not the original predicition and it fails because it makes massive unfalsifiable assumptions like assuming our extinct ancestors had this when there is no way to prove this without presupposing that we had a common ancestor which is circular reasnoning. Unless you would like to claim that vestigials is just same structure different functions but then it becomes homology not vestigial which is compatible with creation.

&gt;4- Pseudogenes. Fail. We are slowly finding out all their benefits and functions. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078729/       + https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593336/

&gt;like wnt3a for example thought to be useless. Now Science confirms that it is far from useless. It is responsible for tasks in the fields of embryonic development, neural development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. 

&gt;5- biogeography is, i would not say a complete fail, since frankly when I studied evolution, there were plenty of suvcesful exmaples of biogeography but that prediction is not always right.


&gt;6 -homology. Well structure is determined by DNA and comparative DNA is compatible with creation as shown below.


&gt;7- xomparative dna is probably the best line of evidence for evolution, though, creation theory similar to how if a creator creates a code in one organism and he likes it then he copies it and uses it in another organism or other organisms similar to how a coder might copy paste a code and use it in other parts of the program or use the same excellent code from one program in other programs

&gt;Antibiotic resistance has also been debunked since Bacteria did not evolve and gain new beneficial mechanisms through mutations but they gained these new mechanisms by in-taking already-existing plasmids from other bacteria that did not evolve. Antibiotic resistance plasmids are [ancient](http://easweb.eas.ualberta.ca/download/file/papers/paper_108.pdf) and they [definetly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21881561) did not [evolve recently](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7365/full/nature10388.html?foxtrotcallback=true) in a lab by ways of mutations (evolutionary mechanism) in test-bacteria gaining new beneficial features.

&gt;Every single line of evidence for evolution. Every single one is absolutely worse than the one before. Although I can kind of sympathize with the comparative DNA argument, this line of evidence however can be explained under ID as well.

&gt;Edit: Even if evolution is true and they somehow digged up some extraordinary evidence over night, evolution would still prove God. Since Blind unguided naturalistic evolution is statistically impossible, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOJRSmrrM0o) is one out of many reasons why. As WLC quotes in the vid,  barrow and tipler in anthropic cosmological principle who calculated that the possibility of the evolution of human genome from a primate ancestor to be somewhere from 4^180^110000 to 4^360^110000 which needless to say is mathematically impossible due to violating borell's law. Moreover, there are 12 steps in human evolution, EACH of which is so improbable under naturalistoc chance that before even ONE can happen, it would take so much time by naturalistic chance that the sun would cease being a main sequence star and turn into a red giant .. which obviously has not happened yet meaning evolution is not and can not be due to naturalistic chance.  So if evolution is true and did happen and unguided evolution can not happen naturally and can only happen under the guidance of God (as proposed by theistic evolution), then God guided evolution and thus exists.

&gt;I think we can summarize it as follows. P1) Evolution happened  (not true but let's grant it) P2) Evolution is proposed to happen in two ways either naturally and unguided (atheist) or either guided by God (theistic evolutionist) P3) Unguided natural evolution can not happen (statistically impossible from ample research like [this](http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/polofsson/research/Chance.pdf) and Tipler and Barrow source quoted in the above video, as a couple examples among many)


&gt;Conclusion : Evolution is due to God and thus God exists.

Its title was:

(The brilliant creationist, he later revealed, seems to be his pastor).

Later he also wrote:

&gt; Did you know there is absolutely nothing writhing physics that allows everything to come out of absolutely nothing? Come debate. It will be proven to you with scientific factual evidence.

Well, Richard:

1. brilliant creationists talking about evolution is very rare because up to now I *hardly* have debated *evolution* with creationists but basically only *their* strawmen and devises.

2. one of these contortions is to confuse cosmology (the big bang theory about the singularity at the onset of the universe) with biology (evolution theory). So, that will be logical fallacy no. 1, a red herring.

3. so if you want to debate singularities and other phenomena related to the big bang theory, you should pose you question on a subreddit about cosmology or phydics or the like. There your nonsense will be made minced meat. But to save your ass against your own crap, read carefully the following before jumping to any of these subreddits: the big bang states that the onset of the universe was a state of highly dense and very hot energy (singularity). Highly dense and very hot energy is everything BUT nothing. When asked about what was before this initial state (the cause of the big bang), all relevatn scientists will say ""we don't know"". Some of them try to make sense out of it but those immediately will admit they are only making a guess. The ONLY ones that *actually* think that everything came from nothing are the religious. In theology it's called ""creation ex nihilo"", *creation out of nothing*. So, if you don't mind, when you want to debate this, don't even go to a subreddit on cosmology or physics but to /r/creation or the like. But, anyway, what we got here is flaw no. 2, a strawman and no. 3. criticizing someone else about something that actually belongs to your own stance. 

4. another thing is that I hardly engage any ""brilliant"" creationst. Creationists generally have no idea what they are tattling about, hence the contortions and strawmen under 1. I *hope* that your pastor is *a lot* more brilliant than you because your tattles are crap and caboodle.

Then this:

&gt; I do except evidence and it supports the biblical creation account more than the evolutionist theory that has never been proven. 

I think the typo here must have been a Freudian slip, I think you intended to say that you *accept* evidence but YOU DON'T. You will *only* accept the evidence that affirms the Bronze Age mythology book.

In SCIENCE the support for biblical creation is nihil and virtually absent. But for evolution theory the evidence is overwhelming. Biologists consider evolution as the main frame uniting theory of their discipline.

But, to say that there is no evidence for evolution is [a plain lie and straight deceit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent). Just saying. So we have here flaw no. 4. straight deceit (no evidence for evolution) and no. 5. lying (pretending to say that one accepts evidence) and no. 6. distortion (misrepresenting the actual state of affairs within science).",74,1509555559,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/7a4wil/im_wondering_if_any_evolutionist_would_like_to/

> Error catastrophe requires a very specific set of conditions . . . A sufficient percentage of mutations have to be harmful.

I'm not so sure about this, from the (few I must admit) works of population geneticists I've seen it seems that the amount of deleterious mutations per genome per generation is what matters, not the percentage necessarily.

> These conditions are so rare and specific that they have never, never been observed in natural populations.

Sure, it might be true that we've never observed the ""average rate of reproduction in a population to fall below 1"", but that doesn't necessarily mean anything, because only after a while of accumulation of deleterious mutations will the average rate of reproduction in a population fall below 1, the better test seems to be to just see if the fitness is declining due to mutation accumulation. And there seems to be 1 example of this:
https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v348/n6300/abs/348454a0.html

/u/darwinzdf42 has pointed out about previous examples I've given that they specifically try to minimise selection by bottleneck passaging, fair enough. This example doesn't explicitly mention that, but I can only see the abstract, so it might be another example like that. If that's the case, I will have to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate whether error catastrophe will occur for humans. In regards to Sanford's simulations, I will have to examine whether the rebuttals given by peeps here are valid.

> So we're looking at low-to-mid single digits for the percentage of mutations that are actually harmful in humans.

This [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004525) gives a figure of 8.2% of the genome that is sequence-specific. Population Geneticist Alexey Kondrashov, who's tried ""[A molecular approach to estimating the human deleterious mutation rate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.1380020312/abstract)"", gives a figure of 10 deleterious mutations per genome per generation in his book ""[Crumbling Genome: The Impact of Deleterious Mutations on Humans]
(https://www.amazon.com/Crumbling-Genome-Impact-Deleterious-Mutations/dp/1118952111/)""

> But then you add in the effects of sexual reproduction and recombination. These allow us to decouple good mutations from bad ones, allowing the bad mutations to be removed via natural selection (i.e. individuals with bad mutations have lower reproductive success), meaning these mutations don't accumulate from generation to generation.

Sexual reproduction and recombination will certainly help to remove deleterious mutations, but I don't see how it, with combined selection, will remove *all* deleterious mutations, it seems to me that it will only remove *some*, and that others will still accumulate. Again, I'll also have to see if there are realistic simulations that include recombination and demonstrate whether error catastrophe will occur for humans.

> The argument creationists use in response to the above is that there are mutations called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" or VSDMs. Mutations that are harmful, but have such small effects that selection cannot remove them. So they accumulate over time and cause a decline in reproductive output over many many generations. There are a lot of problems with this argument. Let's go through them. First, fitness effects are context dependent. There are very few mutations that are inherently, universally beneficial or harmful. Fitness effects depend on the genetic and ecological context in which they occur. So if a mutation has no fitness effects, it isn't a VSDM. It's neutral. Period. Second, for VSDMs to be the drivers of error catastrophe, they have to accumulate slowly enough to not be subject to selection, but also rapidly enough to drive a decrease in fitness. But these two things cannot simultaneously occur. If they cause a decline in fitness, then the individuals with the VSDMs have fewer offspring, and those mutations become less common. Which means that in order for error catastrophe to happen, a large number of mutations have to occur in a single generation. But...

If the experiment I linked doesn't try to minimise selection than it seems to rebut these two points. If it does try to, then again, I'll have to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans.

> Third, if harmful mutations were accumulating, either very slowly or in a big burst, we'd see the effects: Reproductive output would decline. Needless to say, the number of humans keeps increasing. There is zero evidence of a global decline in fitness. Localized decreases in reproductive output are due to choices, not physiology.

The human population would not necessarily decline, this would only be the case after a long while of deleterious mutation accumulation, it wouldn't be apparent immediately. Human reproductive output, aka human population growth, nowadays seems to be more due to medicinal, agricultural, and technological advancements, not fitness.

Also, most population geneticists disagree with you that the human fitness is not declining. Here's three of them to start off with:

* http://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8380.full
* http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/961.full
* https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v336/n6198/abs/336435a0.html

> Given the lower density, lower mutation rates . . . there's zero chance we're experiencing error catastrophe.

As far as I know most population geneticists say that it's not the percentage of mutations that are deleterious that necessarily matters, but the amount of them per genome per generation. Likewise, the per nucleotide mutation rate doesn't matter, only the amount of deleterious mutations per genome per generation matters.

> The mutations have to have effects so minor, selection cannot act on them (i.e. they are neutral), but they also have to be harmful enough to cause not just a measurable decline in fitness over time, but a terminal decline in fitness over time. Those two things cannot simultaneously happen.

I don't see why the two can't happen simultaneously, the argument is that new deleterious mutations are being generated too fast for natural selection to remove all of them, it's that natural selection can only prevent the most deleterious mutations from accumulating, not all. Another way to examine this point is to again, see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans. 

> A mutation or set of mutations cannot simultaneously be effectively neutral and also cause a decline in reproductive output.

The argument is that natural selection can only prevent the most deleterious mutations from accumulating, not all. Another way to examine this point is to see if the experiment I linked doesn't try to minimise selection. And another one of course, again, is to see if there are realistic simulations that demonstrate that error catastrophe will occur for humans.

They constantly would dismiss every scientific argument I made. Explained to them how they do not have to believe that the earth is 6,000 years old and that the Bible might not mean literal 24-hour days (sun wasn't created till day 4 etc.) However, every single time I brought up an arugment regarding science and how we can know that the earth is older than 6,000 years old they would say that I ""don't have enough faith."" I explained to them how we have trees  sequences that go back farther than 6,000 old. I also explained how we can determine if more than 1 ring happens to form during a year by comparing the rings with previous trees and what not. They would simply dismiss this. They say that they are trusting, ""God's word"" and I am trusting ""Man's word."" There is simply know way to argue with this. I can prove to them the earth is not 6,000 years old, but they dismiss everything no matter what. It got to the point that, I asked one of the kids a question. I asked him whether or not he would keep believing the Bible if it said the earth was flat (I never claimed it actually did say that). The kid said he would. I went further and asked if he himself was taken into space and went around the earth and saw for himself that it was round, would he still believe the Bible? He said that he would. These people don't care what the facts are, they care about believing, not what's actually true. Even after all the evidence I provided they quoted the bible verse that says, ""For we live by faith, not by sight."" I don't think I will argue with them again. There is no way I can.

Although I've tried explaining the concept of ERVs (maybe not the best option, but), this person believes that:

* Similarity in DNA can't be used as evidence in a common ancestor because the small percentage difference is the reason why animals are so different in forms and in their DNA control mechanisms

I feel like the banana DNA is going to be mentioned. But isn't the genetic similarity why humans and apes have such similar anatomy, instincts, and emotion? 

* Two species must have the same retrovirus in order to have the same common ancestor. (Brought up coelacanths and humans sharing no retroviruses)

I thought that not all species share the same retroviruses... 

* That ERVs are junk DNA because they have specific functions as a part of the control mechanism in a cell, so therefore, believes that the retroviral invasion in primate evolution never happened

DebateEvolution,78ya98,AnotherRowan,Evolutionist,,self.DebateEvolution,,Theological arguments in support of Evolution:,"Here's this lovely piece, that defends evolution from a theological standpoint. 
http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1986/JASA3-86Murphy.html

Very important part: 
""We now move to our central topic of creation and its relationship with evolution. The evolutionary view can take seriously the biblical picture of humanity being formed from the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7), in common with other living creatures (Ps. 104:20-30). It is their relationship with God which distinguishes human beings from other animals (Ps. 8). According to evolutionary theory, we bear in our bodies the history of our organic relationship with the rest of the bio- sphere. Evidence for this is supplied by embryology, by the commonality of the genetic code, the similarity of protein structures and the homological features of gross anatomy. From the standpoint of history and physical constitution, there is no sharp distinction between human beings and other animals.

With this in mind, we proceed to the argument for the theological superiority of evolution over creationism. Of course we must realize that arguments and proofs are always contingent upon certain presuppositions, so that it is important to make these as explicit as possible. The following form of the argument will be helpful:

(A) The whole creation is to be redeemed. (See 11(3) above.)

(B) What has not been assumed (i.e., taken up by God in the Incarnation) has not been redeemed. (See 11(4) above.)

(C) Because of (B), the whole creation cannot be redeemed unless it has been assumed. But (A) states that it is to be redeemed. Therefore the whole creation has been assumed in the Incarnation.

Creationism appears to allow no way for our conclusion to be satisfied. In that theory, humans are of a nature totally different and isolated from the natures of other creatures, so that the Incarnation ""can't touch"" non-humans. Evolution, however, says that humans are related to other creatures, sharing not only the same chemical elements and related structures, but also a common history. Thus evolution appears to provide the theologically superior understanding of creation.""",7,1509049196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/78ya98/theological_arguments_in_support_of_evolution/

DebateEvolution,75izvm,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Video from the echo chamber featuring my favorite bs artist, Nethaniel Jeanson, lying about things.","Oh this guy. He lies a lot. I feel comfortable saying that because he has a PhD in cell biology, and knowing what goes in to something like that, he can't not know that what he says is all bs. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm going to break the claims in [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/759jm0/replacing_darwin_an_interview_with_nathaniel/) down categorically, because it jumps around a bit. 

&amp;nbsp;

So we start with a Darwin quote mine, and the quote isn’t even relevant since Darwin didn’t have neutral theory. So his formulation that evolutionary changes require selection at every step isn’t valid. But here we are with a purported expert lying about it this. 

Later on, he claims “Darwin’s test is as valid today as it was then,” which…no it isn’t. Darwin didn’t have neutral theory. We now know that many evolutionary changes are not driven by selection. Darwin thought differently, and he was wrong. So a statement made by Darwin based on this conclusion is in no way “as valid today as it was then.”

But then oh! We finally we got to neutral evolution. Which leads to big scary numbers. Which is a complete misunderstanding of how this all works. See the problem? For Jeanson, it’s either just selection, or just random chance. But in reality, it’s the two operating together. Random processes generate variation, selection acts on that variation. Neutral theory doesn’t say that natural selection doesn’t happen, just that it isn’t the *only* process driving evolutionary change. Surely Jeanson knows this, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

They also discuss abiogenesis quite a bit, but Jeanson seems to be under the impression that DNA, RNA, and protein would all appear in modern-looking cells at once, which…is not what anyone thinks happened. He also says that there would need to be RNA and proteins to replicate DNA, as though that would have been the original genomic medium, rather than RNA. 

In fact, several times he says specifically that you’d need proteins for this or that. The word “ribozyme” never comes up. It’s just that you need all of this stuff to randomly assemble. The best is when the other guys is like how could these molecules come together, “or even find themselves in a whole mass of other organic chemicals?” Uh, let’s see, they’re located in a big mass…of…**organic chemicals**. That’s how the **organic chemicals** come together. It’s at about 10 minutes, and I highly recommend watching that bit for the lols. 

Jeanson also mentions chirality, but apparently [hasn’t done his homework.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/65pp3u/how_did_homochirality_emerge_like_this/)

&amp;nbsp;

And of course it wouldn’t be a creationist propaganda film without paying homage to Michael Behe, the patron saint of selling out for the $$$, by mentioning irreducible complexity. Several times, Jeanson asserts that there are “systems that could not have evolved” due to irreducible complexity, but oddly, he never names any. But he does it with DNA, and he does it during a hilariously ignorant riff on dinosaurs and birds, which he prefaces with “I don’t know the biology necessarily of birds and dinosaurs in great detail,” which becomes clear instantly. 

Aside, this riff is why I think he’s lying through his teeth for the rest of it. When he’s bs’ing on birds and dinosaurs, he’s clearly on his back foot and out of his expertise. He’s just adlibbing. But for the rest of his inane claims, they’re well practiced, confident, and the delivery is smooth. Which means he knows the information, and he therefore knows he’s lying. 

But the takeaway is that there are several claims of IC, but no evidence of IC. As usual. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally. this whole exercise devolves several times into assertions that abiogenesis and evolution are impossible. It’s just WOAH COMPLICATED arguments from incredulity, which is really the central argument here. Which is to say, there isn’t really an argument here. It’s just vacuous assertions with no evidence behind them. And that’s exactly what I’ve come to expect from **Dr.** Nathaniel Jeanson: A well-credentialed liar.

DebateEvolution,74uet6,tacforall,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"Reasons for evolution, are they all valid?","1. Micro evolution occurs, we observe this by looking at species adapting towards new environments

2. Species that get isolated, morph independently into adapted versions that don't mate with each other

3. We see a logical flow of species in our fossils, showing how species adapt step wise into new species

4. The species of 3 are also connected through A) similar DNA, B) ERV's (viruses on the same spots) and C) similar bone structures

5. Thus we can conclude that macro evolution really occurs.

Logic requires us to entail 5, IF 1,2,3,4 are all true statements.

Now I wonder the following about each individual statement:

1. I agree with this statement (Darwin’s birds, modern examples), but still have doubts about micro evolution adapting species so much, that they change into new species. 2,3,4 would entail this, but that’s why I’m having questions about these reasons:
2. This is true, but we only observed this to happen in pre-zygotic terms, meaning they changed mating preferences but are still biological capable of successful mating. Post-zygotic changes are said to be supported by statements 3 and 4.
3. I know about some evidence of step wise morphings of fossils such as Tiktaalik and the fish with the lungs, but I haven’t seen much more evidence for this yet. 
4. If all these 3 are true than this statement has a lot of weight, but they have to mean what they imply as well. That's why I have questions about these 3 sub statements:

A) Firstly I wonder, is the related DNA of assumed precursors in fact more similar to the assumed precursors than any other specie? And how does this proof more, than the fact that similarity in appearance is also observable as similarity in DNA? 

B) Secondly I wonder, are the found ERV’s only found in the species that are related to each other, or are they found in every specie in that specific environment? And the fact that the ERV's appear in the same spots as the assumed precursors, does that entail that they are related or could that also mean that species that are (just) similar to each other, could also handle ERV's in the same way?

C) I think this one is only valid when A) and B) are valid. It seems like similar bone structure couldn’t proof anything on it’s own, only that some of the found fossils look similar, which seems like begging the question if we call that proof for them to be related.

DebateEvolution,74ucce,tacforall,,,self.DebateEvolution,,How to falsify evolution? (And is evolution truly empirical opposed to meta-physical),"**Background info:**

A theory is strong when there is found (&gt;X) verification.

All ravens are black is being verified by finding black ravens.
Now Karl Popper, criticized this scientific approach, simply because it's impossible to find all ravens and conclude every raven is black. That is why he suggested that in order to test a theory, one should look for examples that would proof the theory is wrong (in theory).
In this case any found non-black raven would falsify the theory. As long as there hasn't been found any falsification, one should hang on to the theory untill there has.

A good theory, is one that a lot of statements that can be verified, and also statements that can be falsified. 

Now we know the concept of God isn't scientific because it's A) meta physical and B) it's kind of impossible to scientifically verify or falsify the God premise, because it contains all causal relationships and is for that matter meta. Even IF God would exist, we couldn't prove God, since that would require us to be on a higher meta level compared to God (such as matter is to us), which the whole premise of God makes impossible (the concept entails that God made everything and is greater than us).

With this knowledge, I start to doubt about evolution as well since it is also the sum of all causal relationships of our universe in a some way meta (also because we extrapolate a lot about processes that are determined to have been going on for billions of years), but, luckily we can use empirical evidence to support it (right?)/ which makes it not meta-physical but an observable empirical phenomena. 

Now if that is the case (evolution = empirical), it should be possible to verify it's premises, but also falsify it's premises.

**The actual question**:

Considering the (mere) possibility of God existing, what could in theory falsify evolution? 

When taking evolution isolated from the possibility of a god God and looking at things purely empirical, what could in theory falsify evolution? And why could it falsify evolution? 

Bonus question: Is evolution, considering the amount of extrapolation that has to be done, truly empirical? Doesn't the POSSIBILITY of a God make the abduction towards evolution meta-physical as well?",26,1507375720,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/74ucce/how_to_falsify_evolution_and_is_evolution_truly/

/u/MRH2, who loves his flair of **M.Sc. physics, Mensa**, posted this thought:

&gt; I am just wondering about this. I thought about asking on /r/debateEvolution, but then realised that I'd just get tons of replies saying that ""abiogenesis is already proven"" despite there being no example in any lab or anywhere that can demonstrate, even just once, the origin of life from non-life.

Or, you'd get posts explaining why it's very possible, and the research and evidence we have that shows this?

&gt; People still seem to believe in abiogenesis so strongly that they are unable to contemplate any alternatives (well, except for maybe panspermia).

Or, creationists are so wound up in their belief that a creator has to exist, they can't ever think that life wasn't specially created, and is just the product of chemistry.

&gt; One would think that analysing various aspects of life and biochemistry would show that there are insurmountable gaps that cannot be crossed with incremental evolutionary changes. One such analysis by Dr. Paul Nelson is described below.

Except abiogenesis is not evolution, so why would life from non-life need to cross any ""incremental evolutionary changes""?

Then he continues to try to argue that the cell cannot exist without most of its components, therefore life had to be specially created.

The circlejerking safe-space is at warp speed.

DebateEvolution,74e4om,preferpaleo,Paleontology Enthusiast,,self.DebateEvolution,,The Geologic Column,"In this post:http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD101.html
Talk. Origins says:
""There are several places around the world where strata from all geological eras do exist at a single spot -- for example, the Bonaparte Basin of Australia (Trendall et al. 1990, 382, 396) and the Williston Basin of North Dakota (Morton 2001).""

Creation wiki responds to this by saying:

""Actually the use of the term ""era"" is somewhat deceptive since there are only three above the Precambrian. That means that only three fossils need to be used to make such a claim. They seem to have deliberately chosen the broadest category they could get away with, since each era above the Precambrian is divided into periods and some periods are divided into epochs. So having all three eras would have a fairly high statistical probability.
First of all, even having strata labeled as from all geological periods does not make the entire theoretical geologic column present. The entire geologic column would require layers of sediment about 100 miles thick and there is no place on Earth where this occurs. In fact this is more than twice the maximum thickness of the Earth crust.
Furthermore, none of these locations have all 34 types of index fossils and neither of the two locations above have all of the geological periods represented by index fossils. The rock layers have been given their respective labels on the basis of a comparison with rocks in other locations and the assumptions of uniformitarian geology.
Actually there is only one location in the world (southern Turkey) with all of the geological periods represented by index fossils, but even this location has only half of the 34 types of index fossils; as such it can be considered just a statistical occurrence.
The result is that the entire theoretical geologic column remains a purely theoretical construct, whose credibility depends on the assumptions of uniformitarian geology.""

&gt; Many of come here to avoid the drama-fest that takes place on other forums. I personally have no desire to have any debates on reddit about evolution. I would just like a place to touch base with the Creation community every now and then. I just don't simply have the time or effort to devote to the cause, nor do I share the enthusiasm others share.

There's constant drama on /r/creation. That's the problem with ideologies based on personal opinions and not on facts: people are wrong just because they don't believe just like you.

&gt; Well now it's open season on user's like me:

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/73ojpk/another_disaster_in_the_making_rcreation_is_there/

&gt; Look at these baffoons!

Besides the numerous grammatical errors in those lines, he's whining that people dare to call him out on his post, *on another subreddit because hardly anyone here can post in reply there*.

What post was he called out for? This one:

&gt; &gt; if we grant the evolutionist a larger timeframe, do we have any response against them?

&gt; Haven't we done this many times already? When Darwin first touted this idea it was 100,000 years. Then they figured out that wasn't enough time for X, so it became 500,000 years. Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years. Now it's how many million?

&gt; The problem, to directly answer your question, is that when evolutionists request a longer timeframe to accommodate for Z, it creates a ripple in a lot of other dating methods that they've already been telling us proves their old time frame.

&gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

He's accusing scientists of inventing numbers, then trying to adjust data to fit those numbers. Then tries to say that if the world weren't old enough, they'd need to make the world older. Science follows the facts, and updates when it's wrong.

He continues:

&gt; As comical as it is that these goons can't rub two brain cells together to follow a conversation, it's actually a bit refreshing to hear an honest ad hominem attack against me.

&gt; Which brings me to the my second point. The shear amount of trolls in the subreddit. It's ridiculous. The politely worded ad hominem attacks are ridiculous. As a result this whole sub looks ridiculous.

An ad hominem attack is an attack against a person, not their argument. That would include calling people ""baffoons"" or trolls, or say that they can't rub two brain cells together to follow a conversation, instead of addressing their points.

&gt; In the thread in question. The OP asked a theoretical question about 'what if' evolutionists extended the time frame for evolution.

""What if"" questions are hypothetical questions, not theoretical ones. Theoretical ones are like the /r/creation OP asked, ""I've seen arguments that the timeframe is wrong and the mutation rate is too low, but if we grant the evolutionist a larger timeframe, do we have any response against them?""

The OP is asking whether creationists have a response to the mutation rate if time were no longer a factor.

4_jacks continues:

&gt; I answered the OP's question with If a biologist finds evidence that extends the time needed for evolution, then it creates problems for all the other disciplines that relate to that same time frame.

&gt; FOUR TROLLS in this forum jump on that with strawmen accusations of conspiracy theory nutbaggery. Not one, not two, but FOUR. That's a lot of trolls who can't even follow a basic conversation. One of them had the audacity to ask me site examples of a theorethical question!

The dishonesty train leaves the station!

/u/Taken-Away responded:

&gt; The biologists and the geologists are secretly plotting to create models that support the other's research? Do you have an example of them doing this in the past?

/u/ADualLuigiSimulator responded:

&gt; If I am understanding your comment correctly, you are implying that the age of the earth is essentially a partly made up age that biologists and geologists are secretly conspiring? Because that is how you are making this sound. ""Oh hey geologists, sorry we might have a problem with evolution over here, could you add another 500 million to the earth's age to solve this?""

. . .

&gt; &gt; When Darwin first touted this idea it was 100,000 years. Then they figured out that wasn't enough time for X, so it became 500,000 years. Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years.

&gt; Could you specifically tell me how you know that? Who did this? When? Where? Who changed these numbers and how was it accomplished? Conspiracy?

&gt; &gt; The problem, to directly answer your question, is that when evolutionists request a longer timeframe to accommodate for Z

&gt; Could you give me an example where ""evolutionists request a longer timeframe""?

&gt; &gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

&gt; You seem to have a pretty harsh opinion about biologists and geologists. They all seem to be diabolic masterminds who are only out to deceive the public with their ""made up"" numbers. Why and where does that opinion come from?

/u/matts2 responded:

&gt; &gt; Then Y showed up and needed more time, so it became a million years. Now it's how many million?

&gt; Who told you this nonsense? You are spreading falsehoods in the name of Christ. Consider what that means.

&gt; Anyway, physics tells us the Universe is about 14.5B years old.

&gt; &gt; So if some Biologist makes a discovery and says there is no way man evolved in less than 10 billion years, now all the geologist who've been telling us the earth is 4.54 billion years old need to juggle around all their numbers to prove the earth is really 10 billion years old.

&gt; Now you go from lies about the past to accusing others of dishonesty. And you do this in the name of Christ.

Finally, /u/4_jacks concludes:

&gt; It really cannot get any more ridiculous! I'm not even going to mention the nutter who was spouting off about sinning for Jesus.

&gt; Trolls are filling this sub reddit to maximum capacity with low quality strawmen and sparsely hidden ad hominem attacks.

&gt; ""Oh look 4_jacks noticed that geologist and biologist share the same evolutionary time frame, HE MUST BE A CRAZY CONSPIR_TARD""

&gt; Why is that pathetic strawman tolerated in this subreddit? Why is that thinly veiled ad hominem attack tolerated on this subreddit?

&gt; I know the moderators put in a lot of work. And it is a thankless task. It's a difficult situation and there are no easy answers. I apologize for the soapbox, but it's an honest attempt to vent frustration which hopefully will effect change. **The first being we should go back to being a private sub-reddit.**

He is really arguing that others are crafting straw men arguments against him, but you can plainly see he misrepresents the responses to him, and the post on /r/debateevolution, just to avoid defending his claims of conspiracy between biologists and geologists.

What he wants is to be able to say what he wants without anyone being able to criticize or scrutinize what he posts. His ideas cannot withstand the light of reason and logic.

That is why we cross-post sometimes from /r/creation, because the dishonesty, the illogical, the complete disregard for reason, keeps finding its way there, and few are able to respond to point out how it's wrong.

When your problem is that you'd rather be wrong if it meant no one could criticize you, reconsider why your subreddit even exists.

It's all just theory until it can be proven. He points to gravity which is laughable because there's another theory called **electromagnetism that disproves gravity.** He does so in a slick way to gain credibility which makes him all the more less credible. You sneakster 

&gt; _""Here we can see something fall to the ground it's Gravity""_

and that proves evolution? Lol. Nope. It *not* even a congruent comparison

Basically he insinuating although we can't explain gravity, but we can see a book fall to the floor we must except evolution, because why? We see different species? **No one has ever seen one species change to another.** 

He thinks, I'll just point to that unproven theory that we can see _""gravity""_ to give credit to an other topic _""evolution""_ that is also just as unproven if not more so because **you can't point to any example of cause and affect. Really?** This is the smart science? Lol. . Ok. That's the logic? Shit with that I can prove all kinds of nonsense. 

But is his argument for Gravity really stupid on its own? Many say yes. Something falling to the earth is a result of gravity, **could it be** a result of electromagnetism? 

Hmmm, both science, both must **require faith** to believe in one or the other. We could get deeper and ask how were either created??? But let's not get too far. Comprehension of proven fact and Theory is already an issue. 

Both just a theory, just like evolution. All **lacking** the distinction of proof by science's own scientific method. **Why would one unproven therory be more believable than the next?**

Many of them hate Christians and act unethically and ruin people's lives like Ota Benga and personal friends like professor of biology Caroline Crocker and persecute Christian students. They tried to deliberately create deformed babies in order to just prove evolution.

&gt; They tried to get me expelled from graduate school when I was studying physics, merely because I was a Christian creationists. It was none of their business, but they felt they had the right to ruin my life merely because I believed in Jesus as Lord and Creator.
I then realized many evolutionists (not the Christian evolutionists) are Satanically inspired because of their psycho evil hatred. So I realized even more, they are not of God, and therefore not on the side of truth. They promote ""The Lie"" because the father of Darwinism is the Father of Lies.

DebateEvolution,734te4,preferpaleo,,,self.DebateEvolution,,RE: Moon dust.,"I am stil having trouble understanding the moon dust argument.
In my previous post I was pretty unclear about what I was asking so here it is reiterated:

According to this source: https://www.space.com/23694-moon-dust-mystery-apollo-data.html The moon gains 0.04 inches of dust every 1000 years. So based off this we could calculate:
4,470,000,000 / 1000= 4470000
4470000 * 0.04 = 178800 inches
= 14900 feet

We find that there should be 14,900 feet of dust on the moon, however, we do not have this amount of dust on the moon. Why don't we have 14,900 feet if the earth is 4.47 billion years old? How thick is the dust on the moon anyways? Please provide sources (lately I have become obsessed with checking sources.)

DebateEvolution,72x4lj,preferpaleo,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationist teacher responds to the distant light problem,"This is my teacher's responses to the distant light problem. Thoughts would be great.

-Define the distant light problem.

  If the earth is 6000 years old, how does light from distant stars beyond 6,000 light years get here. Evolutionists assume that with a 14 billion year old universe they have no problem here. But hold on, they have as much a problem as the creationist. The universe is said to be 156 billion light years from end to end.      If the earth was in the middle of that (which it isn’t) it would be 78 billion light years from each end.     So how de we see that if we have only only been around 14 billion years?   There is a second problem also, called the Horizon problem. The universe has been found to be uniform in temperature, but it is so big at 158 billion light years, that there hasn’t been enough time even at 14 Billion years for the temperature to exchange and even out cause that is light at the speed of light evening out.

  -What are some possible solutions?

  There are TWO solutions we don’t want to use.  

-People have said, the distances are not that big. They are that big, Our God is that big.  

-God created the light on its way. The problem is, we would be seeing this that weren’t really there, and thus God would be lying to use.  

Solutions we do use.  

1) CDK. The speed of light was faster at creation. The problem with this is that the speed of light is linked to nature with the famous equation c=mc^2. If you speed up light, matter also becomes massive. If you increase the speed of light, the amount of energy increases exponentially. This change in energy can be trouble. They are still working on this.  

2) GTD Gravitational time dilation. Time flows at different rates. Perhaps the universe has aged millions of years, while the earth has aged millions of years. General relativity shows clocks move more slowly when in a gravitational- well. If the earth is near the center of the universe time would flow more slowly here. The question is, is the well deep enough, and the details are still being worked out.  

3) The alternate synchrony convention. This one has to do with time zones. Is it a matter of if we are in different time zones.   

4) The supernatural solution. God sped up the universe during creation week and slowed time down on earth during the same week. 

Some of these ""solutions"" he debunked himself. Thoughts below would be nice.",9,1506564688,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/72x4lj/creationist_teacher_responds_to_the_distant_light/
DebateEvolution,72sp7f,Fake_News_1000,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Archaeological evidence ignored and academic dishonesty,"The [Hueyatlaco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco) site is an archaeological site in Mexico which contains archaeological activity dated to 250,000 ybp. 

Because I except most of you to be lazy to read the article, I will post relevant excerpts here. 

&gt;Excavations were conducted via standard protocols, including securing the sites to prevent trespass or accidental disturbances

and:

&gt;During excavation, investigators discovered numerous stone tools. The tools ranged from relatively primitive implements at a smaller associated site, to more sophisticated items such as scrapers and double-edged blades uncovered at the main excavation site. The diversity of tools made from non-local materials suggested that the region had been used by multiple groups over a considerable period.

Now, immediately after these finds and the dating, this is what one member said:

&gt;In 1967, Jose L. Lorenzo of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia claimed that implements had been planted at the site by local laborers in such a way as to make it difficult or impossible to determine which artifacts were discovered in situ and which were planted.

See the double standards employed here?  This argument is typical of Darwinists, and is invoked whenever evidence that contradicts the evolutionary historical narrative is found. Michael Cremo of *Forbidden Archeology* points out several such incidents over the last 200 years. 

Then,

&gt;Irwin-Williams counter-argued that **Lorenzo's claims were malicious and without merit.** Furthermore, in 1969 Irwin-Williams[4] cited statements of support from three prominent archeologists and anthropologists (Richard MacNeish, Hannah Marie Wormington and Frederick A. Peterson) who had each visited the site independently and attested to the integrity of the excavations and the professionalism of the group's methodology.

So now we see academic dishonesty and attempted cover up. 

It gets more interesting: 

&gt;Radiocarbon dating of the animal remains produced an age of over 35,000 ybp. Uranium dating produced an age of 260,000 ybp, ± 60,000 years.
**The authors stated that they had no definitive explanation for the anomalous results.** However, Malde suggested the tool-bearing strata had possibly been eroded by an ancient streambed, thus combining older and newer strata and **complicating dating.**

We see this response everywhere for other ""anomalous findings"". Scientists tend to simply *explain away* things that contradict established theories. This is another case of double standards too,  because they never invoke the ""measurement contamination"" to explain away findings consistent with theories. Plus there is actually no proof of data contamination. 

Later on:

&gt;They were able to rule out Malde's streambed hypothesis.

Also, 

&gt;Irwin-Williams asserted that Hueyatlaco had not been accurately **dated to her satisfaction.**

Which means a more recent date.

&gt;Malde and Steen-McIntyre argued that the 200,000 ybp findings were valid, while Irwin-Williams argued in favor of a more recent -- though still somewhat controversial -- figure of 20,000 ybp. Webb and Clark[6]suggest that **her promoting the 20,000ybp date is ""particularly puzzling,"" as it was unsupported by any evidence the team uncovered.**

More academic dishonesty and fraud. 

Several papers were indeed published on this finding, such as this:

&gt;The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an **archeological dilemma** [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which **serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.**

So that's it, forget about it and move on. Most people haven't even heard of this finding and they don't even mention it in school. They still teach that humans haven't entered Americas no earlier than 25k ybp.

Imagine how many ""anomalous finds"" were ignored. But it turns out, anomalous finds over time no longer become anomalous, they become regular evidence.",17,1506523361,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/72sp7f/archaeological_evidence_ignored_and_academic/

I'm not gonna include all of them, cause many I can easily debunk myself. However, there are a few outside my area of expertise. So here are the arguments (responses that I could take to class would be great):

(Taken from my notes. Most, if not all, are his exact words)

-If language evolved, the earliest languages should be the simplest. On the contrary, it appear that acient languages were more complex with respect to syntax, cases, genders, tenses, verb forms, etc. The evidence shows that language devolves

-The studies of documented children who were raised without contact with other humans. Ferol children show that human speech appears to be learned from other humans. humans apparenly have no inborn ability to speak. So how did the first humans learn how to speak?

-If the earth in its alleged origin had oxygen in its atmosphere, the chemicals needed for life would hald been removed by oxidation. But if their had been no oxygen then there would have neen no ozone, ALl life would quickly be destroyed.

-DNA can only be reproduced with the help of certain enzymes, but the enzymes act at the direction of DNA. SInce each requires the other, evolutionists don't have a satisfactory explanation for either origin.

-Amino acids when found in nonliving matter come in two forms, they call them left handed and right handed, but they are chemically equivalent with two possibilities, half of the matter is right handed, the other left handed. When we go to the protein molecules found in all forms of life, there amino acids are only of the left handed variety. The mathematical probability that this is by chance is virtually zero.

-There are many instances where quite different forms of life are completely dependent on each other. Example: Fig trees and fig gall wasps, etc. Did these evolve at the same time? In many examples such as the one listed above, they would have had to evolve at exactly the same time.

-According to all theroms of the evolution of the solar system:

The planets should all rotate on their axis in the same direction. However, Venus and Uranus rotate backwards.

-All the moons of the various planets should revolve in the same direction at least 11 revolve backwards.

-The orbits of these moons should all be in the equitorial plane of the planet they oribit. Many, including the earth's, are highly inclinded.

DebateEvolution,72la5t,Putin_PresidentOfUSA,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Human evolution does not require we evolve from apes while on Earth,"The theory of evolution sufficiently explains the biological and genetic changes between one generation and the next, and how beneficial mutations can help a species survive. 

It does not explain abiogenesis, because it's beyond its scope, and more importantly, does not explain the history of species change on Earth. Simply put, evolutionary theory is the biological and genetic explanation for how species change over time; mutations and adaptations, and not the ""what happened and what changed"". 

In order to know the ""what happened"", we must turn to the fossil record, because that is stronger evidence than making inferences from genes. What this means is that humans could have lived since the beginning Earth was formed with very little change. There is no ""requirement"" in evolutionary theory that we be descendants of apes while on earth. You may then ask, how do we share so much DNA with them? We reply, because the designer used the genome of the ape, made some modifications before creation to make it human, and placed both species on Earth at the same time. In other words, we share DNA with apes because we look like them. 

Then you will ask, where is the fossil evidence? Michael Cremo has published a  book called *Forbidden Archaeology* that illustrates numerous finds of the last 200 years showing hominid activity dating to 2 billion years ago. Unfortunately, this evidence was dismissed because it ""didn't fit he model"". Cremo also shows that bureacracy was more important than fossil finds. 

His finds show that there is no contradiction between ancient human antiquity and the theory of evolution.

Evolution is simply the genetic explanation for how species change. There is no requirement in the theory that mutations have to occur in a specific way, or at all. A shark can remain a shark unchanged for billions of years, if no mutations occurred in its species.

DebateEvolution,725gfa,DarwinZDF42,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Somebody Wrangle These Goalposts!,"I just want to take a moment highlight what is possibly the most hilarious and egregious goalpost-moving I have ever encountered. Gymnastics like this are the reason that we can never ""win"" this debate; we just have to keep playing whack-a-mole as we find awesome new things and pushing the limits of our knowledge and understanding of evolutionary change. And when we do that, creationists will pull these kinds of shenanigans, because it's all they can do. 

&amp;nbsp;

So here's the setup: A thread titled [""If microorganisms and cells are subject to evolution why isn't all life?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/701pvm/if_microorganisms_and_cells_are_subject_to/) Good f'in question, u/eintown. The answers are your typical micro/macro stuff, but buried a bit is this one comment I'd like to highlight, from u/honestcreationist:

&gt;Speciation has been observed in microbes and in more complex forms of life. However, species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

Okay, we have a concrete standard here, or at least concrete-ish, considering that the degrees of difference between these taxonomic levels is a bit subjective. But it's more specific than we usually get. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I highlighted this comment, among others, [in this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqm0e/?context=10000) and provided *Paulinella chromatophora*, an amoeboid rhizarian that has acquired a primary plastid, as an example of an organism that has undergone change of the magnitude we usually see separating members of different kingdoms. In this example, it's going from a heterotroph to an autotroph. A big change. 

&amp;nbsp;

But apparently not good enough.

First, it isn't a ""new"" kingdom:

&gt;I specifically said ""new"" kingdom, but he tried to use an example of a kingdom transfer.

Then it's ""well it's not *technically* a new kingdom"":

&gt;As far as I can tell, Paulinella chromatophora is still considered a rhizarian, not an alga. Do you have a source that calls it an alga or places it in Viridiplantae?

Well duh, phylogenetically it's a rhizarian. That's. The. Point. Something that *isn't* closely related to green algae acquired the traits of green algae, in this case via endosymbiosis and horizontal gene transfer. Differences so large we normally see them in organisms of different kingdoms. 

&amp;nbsp;

But wait! It's time to move those goal posts again. Now the problem is that we're still dealing with microbes:

&gt;the original post in /r/Creation was asking about scaling evolutionary processes from microbial life to macroscopic life. Horizontal gene transfer does not scale to macroscopic life

But even this new objection isn't valid. We see the *exact same processes* going on in animals. [*Elysia chlorotica*,](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/46/17867.short) for example. 

Think that settled it? Of course not! What do you think this is, some kind of rational discussion? Here's the next objection:

&gt;Horizontal gene transfer is not the primary mechanism of evolution in multicellular organisms, even if it does happen.

So never mind that we're observing it happen and causing a giant change (photosynthetic animals!), it's not the *primary* mechanism, so it doesn't count. 

&amp;nbsp;

But we're almost there. [I pointed out this bait-and-switch,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dn3e3md/) and this was the response:

&gt;But while HGT can increase diversity for a particular species, it doesn't increase the overall biodiversity, as the same genes are being shifted around. So evolution by HGT cannot account for the whole of modern biodiversity.

See the new problem? Now it's not that HGT can't or doesn't happen. It's that it can't explain *everything*. Never mind that there are, you know, other evolutionary mechanisms also operating. It's apparently all on HGT, and since HGT can't explain *everything*, that's it, evolution isn't possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is pointless right? Well let me give you one more. [I asked straight up:](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqbee/)

&gt;So I'm going to ask again, since an animal becoming photosynthetic apparently isn't significant enough to make you think twice, what would be enough?

The answer? Oh, this answer. I want to print this out and frame it as a tribute to cognitive dissonance. [What would make u/honestcreationist think maybe evolution can explain major changes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/704bkd/various_false_creationist_claims/dnfqf7h/)

&gt;An animal becoming photosynthetic via vertical processes.

&lt;italian chef kissing fingers&gt; Perfect. The thing that would do it is the *exact thing we're observing*, but through a *different mechanism*. A-maze-ing. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that concludes, for now, the saga of the moving goalposts, in which we started with 
&gt;However, species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

The arguments are the same shit as always, no transitional fossils, multi-strata fossils, etc. Its the same shit I have always heard and knew how to disprove. There are only a few things that I don't know how to respond to because I don't have any knowledge in this area. So here are a few of the claims that I did not know how to respond to. I know very little about the big bang, but I'm sure you guys will know how to respond.

Here are my notes: (exact words from my teacher)

Astronomy.

-Astronomy is a hot bed of evolution.

-The dominant theme today is the Big Bang theory.

-The Universe was spontaneously born out of chaos and immense explosion of mass-energy about 14 billion years ago. Ever since, matter has been expanding outward. Stars, galaxies, planets, and people graduallly formed from these fragments.

-Evolutionists must tread lightly over problems like:

*Where did the intial mass energy come from?

*What caused it to become unstable and begin to expand?

Ignoring these problems, what evidence is promoted for the Big Bang?

-The measured redshift in the light radiated from different stars. Light from most stars is found to be reder (longer wave length) thus moving away. Thus the universe is expanding. But, hubble was causing trouble, further out, younger galaxies all over, are mixed with older galaxies. Also, light can be redened by gravity. (Einstein predicted this in 1912. Gravity can bend light.) As light moves away from a star its energy is lessened and thus its frequency is shifted. But this is ruled out because of asymmetry. The redshift is all over the sky. And this explanation would only work if the earth was centered at the precise center of the universe.

-Another problem hubble discovered is that galaxies next to each other have different red shifts.

(Btw, I have no idea what redshift is. I am interested in biology and evolution, not the Big Bang theory.",18,1505780240,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/70z7yu/creationist_teacher_vs_the_big_bang/

&gt;I imagine there would be quite a bit of genetics research, including studying pseudogenes, comparing ""gene trees"" to the standard evolutionary tree, and the specific effects of evolution on the genome.

&gt; As an extension of the genetics research, baraminology would practically become its own field as they endeavor to define the originally created kinds.

&gt; Lastly, there would be intense scrutiny of radiometric dating techniques. These procedures are quite expensive, so it is hard for creationists to study them in-depth without significant funding. Usually they have to go through third-party dating labs, which are not always cooperative.

&gt; Would evolution (that is, Universal Common Ancestry) still be the dominating theory? I doubt it. Creationism (if not the modern form) was the dominant theory when the Church had most of the power and money, for better or worse.

The creationists over there seem to think that the best way to do creationist research is to take existing research, and try to find out how it applies to creationism and/or disproves evolution.

For some reason, ""look for God"" is not there.

Creationists, you are actively admitting that you know that your god is a myth, that you wouldn't want to use research funds to find this god. Or you think all you need is faith, which is also admitting that your god is a myth that can only believed as it does not exist.

(Also, to the OP: good f'ing question.) I want to highlight a few of the most egregious ones, in case anyone happens to be able to post over there, or wants some ammunition for future debates on the issue.

So without further ado:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Cells becoming resistant to drugs is actually a loss of information. The weak cells die. The strong live. But nothing changed. Nothing altered. It just lost information.

Can be, but mostly this is wrong. Most forms of resistance involve an additional mechanism. For example, a common form of penicillin resistance is the use of an efflux pump, a protein pump that moves the drug out of the cell. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;species have not been observed to diverge to such an extent as to form new and separate kingdoms, phyla, or classes.

Two very clear counterexamples: *P. chromatophora*, a unique and relatively new type of green algae, is descended from heterotrophic amoeboid protozoans through the acquisition of a primary plastid. So amoeba --&gt; algae. That would generally be considered different kingdoms. 

Another one, and possible my favorite, is that time a plasmid turned into a virus. A plasmid acquired the gene for a capsid protein from a group of viruses, and this acquisition resulted in a completely new group of viruses, the geminviruses. 

It's worth noting that the processes working here are just selection operating on recombination, gene flow (via horizontal gene transfer), and mutation. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Creationists don't believe that they [microevolution and macroevolution] are different scales of the same thing.

Creationists are wrong. See my last sentence above. Those are ""macro"" changes via ""micro"" processes.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;we have experiments to see if these small changes would have any greater effect in bacteria that rapidly reproduce at an extraordinary rate, they keep trying, but they have yet to get a different kind of bacteria or anything noteworthy enough to make any claim of evolutionary evidence.

Except, for example, a novel metabolic pathway (aerobic citrate metabolism) in *E. coli*. Or, not in the lab, but observed in the 20th century, mutations in specific SIV proteins that allowed that virus to infect humans, becomes HIV. I think that's noteworthy.

Are they the same species or not? For evolutionary world view the answer is simple, they are closely related, but not the same species. Meaning we can just apply the tree of life here, that all species have common ancestors at some point in history. 

However in creationism world, there is no such thing as 'closely related', because every animal belongs to a hardcoded group, called 'kind' and they don't have any common ancestors to each other, because they were created separately.

On the one hand, they can breed with each other, which means **they are so similar to each other, that their DNA almost matches and they must be considered related.** 

On the other hand, they can't really produce a fertile offspring, meaning they can't be the same species, as Creationsts have always argued that no matter how much mutations are applied to a species, it still remains the same species. **Thus the horse and the zebra can't origin from the same ancestry**, otherwise they could produce a fertile offspring by creationist expectations.

Paradox happens when a creationist is trying to answer whether they are the same species or not. Both answers produce a new question that can't be answered from non-evolution point of view. If yes, then why can't they produce a fertile offspring? If no, then why can they mate at all? It's too common in nature that some species are so similar to be a part of a grand design, there's no reason why there would be so many different species who can mate with each other without evolution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_hybrids 

Furthermore, isn't the horse and the zebra, or lion and tiger, actually a live proof of speciation, since they are on the verge of becoming a completely different species, but have not changed enough to be completely infertile toward each other DNA? So they are essentially a visible example of how transitional species emerge. Technically every species is transitional towards something else, if viewed in certain timeline, but such parallel evolution of those pairs that can breed unsuccessfully describes better how it actually happens in my opinion.",10,1505370155,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/700i2h/arent_some_modern_species_essentially_a_paradox/

DebateEvolution,6zkagx,No-Karma-II,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution's hypothesis and null hypothesis,"For a theory to be scientific, it must possess two opposing criteria: a hypothesis and a null hypothesis. A valid formulation for a theory must set forth a test that, when passed, demonstrates that the theory shows that something is true. This is the hypothesis. Likewise, a valid formulation for a theory must set forth a test that, if passed, demonstrates that the same something is false. This is the null hypothesis.

####Neo-Darwinian Evolution
 
The null test hypothesis for Darwin's theory was offered by Darwin himself in his Origins monograph, when he famously said:

&gt; ""If it can be demonstrated that a complex organ exists which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.""

Now it must be asked, is this test too strict? After all, how does one demonstrate that such a genetic pathway cannot possibly exist? And the mere inability to demonstrate impossibility does not demonstrate necessity. Nevertheless, there is no universal standard of strictness for null hypotheses, and I would be willing to accept this as a valid null hypothesis, as long as the validation test is correspondingly strict. Let me suggest such a test, updated to the current neo-Darwinian Synthesis:

&gt; ""If it can be demonstrated that a complex organ was in fact formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis will have been confirmed.""

Of course, for theories like gravitation, such confirming tests are performed repeatedly and routinely. The theory is tested at high and low temperatures, for large bodies and small, and in the presence and absence of a never-ending list of special conditions. But for the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis, no such thing has ever been demonstrated. To do so, one would have to lay out a series of slight (slight enough to be the result of random mutations) modifications (actual, or at least theoretical) and show that the resulting phenotype could successfully compete in its environment and gain dominance, so as to enable it to found the next evolutionary stage. Not only has this never been demonstrated for a complex organ (such as the eye or brain), it has not been demonstrated for a simple organ (hair follicle or eyelid), nor for a system (lymph or endocrine), tissue (smooth muscle or vein), cell (blood or neuron) or organelle (ribosome or Golgi apparatus).

In fact, no genetic pathway has *ever* been documented in this manner. Certainly, individual mutations have been documented which resulted in the generation of distinguishable, even useful phenotypes, such as the nylon-eating bacterium. But even these have been shown to not increase the information content in the cell, and in the case of this bacterium the cell appears to have a mechanism already in place involving highly mutation-sensitive plasmids to facilitate this very type of mutation, similar to the amazing ability of antibodies to form random antigen bonding sites via hyper-mutation, even to synthesized allergens that have never before existed in nature.

Isn't it a bit premature to declare that ""evolution is a fact, not a theory"", as Carl Sagan did in his book ""Cosmos"" (p.27)? Evolution claims to be the sole mechanism responsible for the generation of every living organism from a single common ancestor — a bold assertion indeed.

The assumptions are:

1) Spontaneous generation non living things to living

My Teacher went on to say, ""Spontaneous genration was hotly debated in medieval universities. Medieval man saw things like dead animals sprouting maggots, dead trees sprouting mushrooms. But they also knew from the bible that life came from life. There was debate. Finally however an iltaian Francesco Redi did a series of experiments that once and for all disporved spontaneous generation. He published his finding in the year 1668. His experiments ended the debate. However, 200 years later with Darwin and his theory, spontaneous generation must be ressurected."" Thats an exact quote btw. 

Even many creationists now cite G.A. Kerkut as evidence that scientists believe that abiogenesis is part of the theory of evolution. Shown citing G.A. Kerkut here: http://www.apologeticspress.org/APContent.aspx?category=9&amp;article=1631

2) This occured only once

3) All bacteria, plants and animals are interrelated.

4) One celled animals gave rise to multicelled animals.

5) Invertebrates are interrelated.

###The RNA world hypothesis: the worst theory of the early evolution of life (except for all the others)

Since this article is laboring under the BDMNP, the ""others"" here are ""other naturalistic hypotheses"". This article is confessing that all naturalistic hypotheses are ""the worst"", but the RNA world hypothesis is the ""least worst"" of all of them.

The BDMNP is *not* an assertion that is determined scientifically. It can't be, since science (commonly-accepted science, that is — not my science) presupposes the BDMNP! All science assumes, ostensibly for methodological purposes only, that naturalism is true. But what sense does it make to presuppose naturalism without believing it is true? Naturalism excludes possible causal explanations for natural phenomena that may, in fact, include the *true* explanation.

If you think that one can apply the BDMNP without being a doctrinaire naturalist, just try performing this thought experiment: assume for a moment that life indeed was supernaturally initiated (you can only do this by stepping out of your naturalist milieu if you are a naturalist). Now, try to explain the origin of life, while laboring under the BDMNP. You will have to accept the least-absurd naturalistic explanation of all possible naturalistic explanations (which is false, by the way), no matter how absolutely absurd the entire set of naturalistic explanations might be.

When examining the DNA of a human and another animal, we find that the farther away the branch of between our common ancestors were (or in other words, the less human-like the creature is) the less DNA we share. 

Because of this, we can know what animals are better fit for testing and what we should or shouldn't test on them. If there's a gene therapy that's supposed to handle a certain few base pairs in the genome, it would be pointless to test it on something that doesn't share that DNA with us. 

That's one of several examples of our knowledge of evolution being used in a practical application. It's not just something read in a textbook but something applied to medical science.

I go to a private creationist high school (not my choice). I am talking classes with Mr. Smith and Mr. Sandy who the other kids say will quote, ""destroy me"" in an evolution debate. I am logging all the claims that are made by my creationist teachers in posts.

Log 1:
So my first week of school is done, but the brain cell killing begins this monday. Mr. Smith is my ""history"" teacher and next week we will be beginning to go through 6,000 years of ""history."" He said that for the first 6 weeks we will be discussing the beginning of history, 6,000 years ago, with creation. He said as we discuss it, it will seem more like a ""science class"" then a ""history"" class. This is a sure sign that we will be discussing the creation/evolution debate for 6 weeks. He explained that we will not be using our textbooks until week 7, so I have no way to evalute his creationist claims ahead of time. I checked the book, there is only one small paragraph about evolution in it (I will type that paragraph in another post). So 6 weeks of creationist claims, with no citations, and no way to find where the claims originated from. I can only sit, listen, and try to write down every claim he makes for class notes and for you guys to read. The best part about this is that after every single class, my smug creationist classmates will leave the classroom taunting me about how he ""destroyed evolution"" without me getting a chance to respond to the claims. I am not just guessing what they will do I know because all past experiences have led me to believe this. When we discussed evolution for 1 and a half weeks in biology the kids would say how evolution is so stupid and mock me. So I will get to hear this everyday for about 6 weeks. People already make fun of me for accepting it, so it will get a lot worse. I'm not trying to get sympathy or look like ""Oh, look how bad my situtation is! Woe is me!"" I am simply trying to log what happens just so people on this subreddit can understand what creationism in the classroom truly is like.

DebateEvolution,6yqds9,monarchist10,,,self.DebateEvolution,See moderator comment,Why I no longer believe in evolution,"So I'm a pre-med college student. Until recently I believed in evolution. However, the more I study higher level Biology, the more I doubt the plausibility of evolution. According to the current theory, life began on Earth approximately 3.5 billion years ago. The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago. 4.6-3.5=1.1 Billion years that it took for life to form. However, according to the [Miller Experiment,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) the probability of creating a primitive cell from random electrical shocks of a biological soup is 1 x 10^-40,000. In other worlds, not even in 1,000 Trillion years would life randomly arise, never-mind in a mere 1.1 Billion years. This is because even if an electrical shock produces a complex amino acid (which is still far, far from a primitive cell) the probability of that complex amino acid being destroyed by a subsequent shock or other factors is extremely high. The probability of many complex amino acids reaching critical mass and somehow arranging themselves into functioning DNA is for all intents and purposes impossible. This in and of itself should be enough evidence that evolution without divine intervention is lunacy.


Now going on to the point that God could have created the first primitive cell and then allowed it to evolve. Again there is the problem that such a cell would very likely be destroyed by the environment or die out. Even if it managed to survive, the chance of random mutations leading to more complex organisms is preposterous. This is because when small mutations occur, they are just that, small mutations. It takes many small mutations in order to create a new species. Most small mutations do not have enough of an advantage to the overall fitness of the species to warrant natural selection. Furthermore, many features that we see today do not provide enough of an advantage to warrant their prevalence in a species. Now it is true that many traits are the byproduct of natural selection for other traits, since genes can often be linked. It is also possible that genetic drift causes a random population to be isolated, which may increase the prevalence of certain traits. However, there are so many unnecessary traits in so many species, that is cannot be attributed to mere genetic byproducts or genetic drift. For example, do human beings really need so many different eye colors and hair colors? Do butterflies really need to have such intricate patterns? Is it really necessary for people to have such complicated eyes? Do peacocks really need such elaborate feathers? Do Elephants really have to have such large tusks? While all these features are nice, they don't really have *that* huge of an effect on reproductive success. 

Finally, even if a trait does have a clear advantage, it is likely to be lost in the general gene pool. If 1 person has a mutation for blonde hair, that mutation will be lost to the tens of thousands of people who do not have this trait. A mutation has to occur simultaneously in numerous individuals in close proximity to one other, who then go on to successfully mate with each other in order for the trait to not be washed away in the general population.

In short, the likelihood of all of these things happening within a timespan of only a few billion years is approximately zero. As such I no longer believe in the theory evolution. ",70,1504820765,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6yqds9/why_i_no_longer_believe_in_evolution/

Creationist Claim: Fossils of marine organisms have been found on mountains. This is evidence that the whole world was once under water, even covering the tops of mountains. Clearly another piece of evidence for Noah's flood.

The fossils were formed before the mountains formed. Before the formation of the mountain, the area, at some point in earth’s history, was a part of the sea. Since this area had marine organisms swimming in it, marine fossils formed. Mountains are formed when two Tecontic plates collide together and causes the earth’s crust to be deformed and land masses are uplifted which form mountains. (Chepkemoi, 2017) When this land is uplifted the marine fossils are taken along with. This is why we see marine fossils on mountains. (BROWNE, 1987) There is no necessary reason to attribute theses fossils to a world wide flood. They can easily be expalined by the formation of mountains.

DebateEvolution,6xosza,Jattok,,,self.DebateEvolution,,"From /r/creation: ""Evolutionary Theorist Concedes: Evolution 'Largely Avoids' Biggest Questions of Biological Origins""","From this recent post on /r/creation:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6xj0wd/evolutionary_theorist_concedes_evolution_largely/

The link goes to a blog post on Discovery Institute's ""Evolution News and Views"" creationist site. The post uses Gerd Mueller's talk at the Royal Society meeting, ""New Trends in Evolutionary Biology.""

[What he discusses in his talk](http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royfocus/7/5/20170015.full.pdf) is how evolution has advanced considerably since the evolutionary synthesis melded together several sciences into one.

&gt; The material basis of inheritance has been unravelled and entire new fields of research have arisen, such as molecular genetics, evolutionary developmental biology and systems biology. In addition, new evolutionarily relevant factors have been described, including non-genetic inheritance, developmental bias, niche construction, genomic evolution and others. Clearly, our understanding of evolution has significantly expanded, and it would be surprising if these empirical and conceptual advances had no theoretical consequences, so that in the midst of a substantial growth of knowledge, the central theory uniting the different fields of biology remained unaltered.

Unfortunately, like with everything dealing with creationists, they skip this part, and go ahead and misrepresent what it is Mueller is arguing.

Part of the criticism:

&gt; Uh, whoa. Or as our friend says, “BOOM.” Read that again. Müller says that “current evolutionary theory…largely avoids the question of how the complex organizations of organismal structure, physiology, development or behavior…actually arise in evolution.” But how stuff “actually arises” is precisely what most people think of when they think of “evolution.”­­­

Could it be that most people think that way due to creationist lies about what evolution is? The theory of evolution as it exists today, and as Mueller painfully illustrates in his talk, wonderfully explains the observations we have with the life on Earth we have today. What it doesn't do is incorporate other hypotheses and theories slightly related to the diversity of life yet.

What Mueller is not doing is saying that evolution fails, or that scientists don't want to bother with these topics. What he's doing is arguing that, long ago we incorporated many sciences into one larger theory, and perhaps it is best that we consider doing this again, *due to the enormous and fruitful work scientists are doing in those fields*.

&gt; Even though claims have been made that classical evolutionary
biology has continuously incorporated aspects from new conceptual domains, the majority of tenets and explanations that appear in characterizations of the current theory are still derived from the MS account and its population genetic principles. In a condensed form, these tenets are as follows: (i) all evolutionary explanation requires the study of populations of organisms; (ii) populations contain genetic variation that arises randomly from mutation and recombination; (iii) populations evolve by changes in gene frequency brought about by natural selection, gene flow and drift; (iv) genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects and the resulting phenotypic variation is gradual and continuous; (v) genetic inheritance alone accounts for the transmission of selectable variation; (vi) new species arise by a prevention of gene flow between populations that evolve differently; (vii) the phenotypic differences that distinguish higher taxa result from the incremental accumulation of genetic variation; (viii) natural selection represents the only directional factor in evolution.

ENV continues its misreprentation with this:

&gt; “Challenges to the classical model” are “widespread” and “none…are unscientific.” Wow — file that one away for future reference.

Except what they're quoting is this, from Mueller:

&gt; The theory of evolution is the fundamental conceptual framework of biology all scientific explanations of living phenomena must be consistent with. As it does not describe a universal law regarding a single natural phenomenon, such as gravity, but rather the principles of organismal change over time, based on the highly complex inputs and interactions of a multiplicity of different factors, evolutionary theory cannot be expected to remain static but is subject to change in the light of new empirical evidence. This is a normal process of scientific advancement and not a heretical undertaking as it is sometimes perceived to be. Explanations of organismal diversity have changed significantly during pre- and post-Darwinian periods, and it should not come as a surprise that fresh stimuli arise from the new methodologies and the expanded scope of modern biological research. Indeed, a growing number of challenges to the classical model of evolution have emerged over the past few years, such as from evolutionary developmental biology, epigenetics, physiology, genomics, ecology, plasticity research, population genetics, regulatory evolution, network approaches, novelty research, behavioural biology, microbiology and systems biology, further supported by arguments from the cultural and social sciences, as well as by philosophical treatments. None of these contentions are unscientific, all rest firmly on evolutionary principles and all are backed by substantial empirical evidence.

What Mueller does point out is that change is sometimes not receptive with biologists:

&gt; Sometimes these challenges are met with dogmatic hostility, decrying any criticism of the traditional theoretical edifice as fatuous, but more often the defenders of the traditional conception argue that ‘all is well’ with current evolutionary theory, which they see as having ‘co-evolved’ together with the methodological and empirical advances that already receive their due in current evolutionary biology. But the repeatedly emphasized fact that innovative evolutionary mechanisms have been mentioned in certain earlier or more recent writings does not mean that the formal structure of evolutionary theory has been adjusted to them. To the contrary, the discrepancies between the current usage of evolutionary concepts and the predictions derived from the classical model have grown.

Mueller is not making an argument, as ENV wants its readers to think, that scientists don't want to explore things like the origins of life or how evolution started because they're going to lead to uncomfortable answers, but because many scientists are against expanding the theory of evolution again to include these questions and answers. And those answers aren't uncomfortable; they're just not for questions asked in the current theory.

We come upon a flat-out lie from ENV:

&gt; Here he obliterates the notion, a truly fatuous extrapolation, that microevolutionary changes can explain macroevolutionary trends

While quoting Mueller (emphasis theirs):

&gt; A subtler version of the this-has-been-said-before argument used to deflect any challenges to the received view is to pull the issue into the never ending micro-versus-macroevolution debate. Whereas ‘microevolution’ is regarded as the continuous change of allele frequencies within a species or population [109], the ill-defined macroevolution concept [36], amalgamates the issue of speciation and the origin of ‘higher taxa’ with so-called ‘major phenotypic change’ or new constructional types. Usually, a cursory acknowledgement of the problem of the origin of phenotypic characters quickly becomes a discussion of population genetic arguments about speciation, often linked to the maligned punctuated equilibria concept [9], in order to finally dismiss any necessity for theory change. The problem of phenotypic complexity thus becomes (in)elegantly bypassed. Inevitably, the conclusion is reached that microevolutionary mechanisms are consistent with macroevolutionary phenomena [36], even though this has very little to do with the structure and predictions of the EES. **The real issue is that genetic evolution alone has been found insufficient for an adequate causal explanation of all forms of phenotypic complexity, not only of something vaguely termed ‘macroevolution’. Hence, the micro–macro distinction only serves to obscure the important issues that emerge from the current challenges to the standard theory.** It should not be used in discussion of the EES, which rarely makes any allusions to macroevolution, although it is sometimes forced to do so.

What Mueller's doing here is explaining the topic of an ""extended evolutionary synthesis,"" or EES:

&gt; The EES was proposed as a theoretical framework that takes account of the plurality of factors and causal relations in evolutionary processes. It continues to see variation, differential reproduction, heredity, natural selection, drift, etc., as necessary components of evolution, but it differs in how these factors are conceptualized. In addition, in the EES, development assumes a constructive role, natural selection is not the only way that variation in populations can be modified, causation does not run solely in one direction from the external environment to populations and, instead of a single inheritance mechanism, several modes of transmission exist between generations.

Mueller is explaining what problems arise with the EES being formulated over the modern evolutionary synthesis:

&gt; The EES is not a simple, unfounded call for a new theory but has become an ongoing project for integrating the theoretically relevant concepts that have arisen from multiple fields of evolutionary biology. Although the EES recognizes the fundaments of the classical MS theory, it differs in its interpretation of the role of some of its elements and integrates new components, such as constructive processes of development, multiple inheritance mechanisms, niche reciprocity, as well as behavioural and cultural elements (on which this overview did not dwell much, but see other contributions to this issue). It is unavoidable to notice that an integration of these concepts means not a simple add-on of a few peripheral notions to the MS model without any effects on its core logic.

The citation in that paragraph regarding microevolutionary mechanisms is for Douglas Futuyma's paper, ""Can Modern Evolutionary Theory Explain
Macroevolution?,"" which notes:

&gt; Early steps toward our growing understanding of developmental mechanisms, especially the models of gene regulation by Jacob and Monod (1961) and Britten and Davidson (1971), informed King and Wilson’s (1975) interpretation of molecular differences between chimpanzee and human, and were featured in chapters on macroevolution in the textbooks by Dobzhansky et al. (1977) and Futuyma (1979). Since then, evolutionary developmental biology (EDB) has become (in my opinion) one of the most exciting dimensions of evolutionary biology. Mechanistic understanding of gene action, of regulatory circuits, of the conservation of elements in the “genetic toolkit,” and their association with different downstream genes are rapidly deepening our understanding of evolutionary changes in form (Carroll et al. 2005; Kirschner and Gerhart 2005; Stern 2011; Davidson 2011).

What Futuyma and Mueller both are arguing in their respective papers is that the modern evolutionary synthesis did not include the developmental mechanisms of evolutionary changes when it was originally proposed, and little work since has been made to incorporate these into the theory itself. Neither of these men are arguing that there's nothing there to explain this (in fact, Futuyma mentions considerable work done in this field in the past few decades). Mueller's arguing that these advances should be rolled into the EES to further explain what the MES does not quite do *on its own*.

Creationists, apparently especially those on /r/creation, do not comprehend that science does not exist within a bubble, and that, even though one theory or one science does not explain everything that someone thinks it should, does not mean that another theory or science *cannot* explain it. And even when science fails to explain something now, does not preclude it from ever being able to in the future.

Simply looking at the advances in science over the past 100 years would show that, if we stuck with what we knew about the world in 1917, we'd definitely be ignorant fools to think that the world today had not progressed at all, in knowledge or in technology.

To summarize, the theory of evolution as it stands today avoids questions of biological origins because it's not designed to explain them at all, *but other sciences are able to answer some of those questions,* and Mueller makes an argument that perhaps it's time we start incorporating these other sciences into the theory of evolution.",11,1504384591,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6xosza/from_rcreation_evolutionary_theorist_concedes/

In that thread, u/DarwinZDF42 commented on a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6sv0bj/supposed_comparative_embryology/) in r/Creation on Haekel's embryos. He (Darwin) said:

&gt; Now, Haeckel had this other idea, that organisms replay their evolutionary history during development. That was wrong, we know it's wrong, and as somebody who teaching biology to college freshmen, I think I'm qualified to say that nobody teaches Haeckel.

&gt; So when creationists bring up Haeckel in a debate about evolutionary biology, it's the equivalent of arguing ""yeah well they thought the sun orbited around the earth, so modern theories of astronomy are wrong"" in an astronomy debate. It has no bearing on the modern discussion, at all.

Then several other pro-evolutionists chimed in and agreed that Haekel was a dishonest scumbag, but that he was thoroughly discredited way back in the 19th century, and therefore has no relevance to modern evolutionary thinking.

Yet, one of the most popular general biology texts in use today, *Biology* by Raven and Johnson, still included an [entire section](http://imgur.com/a/cHiMI) devoted to Haekel's embryos in its 5th edition, copyrighted 1999! There is no mention of the fact that Haekel was censured by the scientific community back in the 19th century and that his idea was thoroughly debunked, discredited and abandoned.

Now, I personally possess copies of this textbook's 5th (1999) &amp; 10th (2014) editions, so I can testify that Haekel's treatment is present in the 5th and (finally, thankfully) absent in the 10th. But I can't tell you whether it persisted in the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th. I can tell you that the 5th edition boasts that earlier editions sold almost a half-million copies, and we can safely assume that they all included positive treatment of Haekel and his embryos. And the 5th edition continued that tradition into the 21st century, a full century after Haekel was debunked. 

The 5th edition *still* makes the false assertion that human embryos possess a tail that is subsequently lost. As I say, this is patently and demonstrably false. A simple enumeration of the bones in the spinal column easily shows that this ""tail"" is merely the spinal column, growing faster than neighboring tissues.

Furthermore, the text accompanying Figure 58.16 clearly claims that the human embryo, like its ontological progenitors, possesses ""gill slits"". This is unadulterated bunk! Perhaps there was a time when the pharyngeal pouch could have been erroneously confused with nascent gill slits, but decades ago we traced the development paths of this pouch to the hyoid cartilage, middle ear bones and parathyroid and thymus glands. It's clear that the authors were feeling pressure against the claims of gill slits, and they added defenses of their claims in the main text, but it appears that the text in this figure escaped the proof-readers' attention.

So, /u/DarwinZDF42, please admit that millions of college freshmen (perhaps even you) were fed bunk that had been debunked over a century earlier.

Okay, so thats a link to a picture of Rocky Dennis. Now, I'm not trying to offend anyone but I'm using him as an example....
Let's pretend he lived 50,000 years ago and had a brother and a sister with the same disorder. Now, let's say they all are born in what is modern day Greece. He ends up dying at the age of 3 while his siblings end up being like nomads. The sister (who happens to have the most severe case of the deformity) travels to Ukraine but dies at the age of 15 while the brother ends up traveling all the way to Saudi Arabia and manages to live until 30 (he only had a slight, but noticeable disfiguration of his skull). Fast forward to present day... Paleontologists end up finding all their bones. The brother was discovered first in 1990. Scientists are amazing and wonder, is this just a fluke, did people look like this, is this another species or Homo sapiens, did we evolve from this? Then, in 2001, the sister is found. Finally, the 3 year old is found in 2014. Given that this disorder makes excessive calcium grow in facial bones, this would enable the disfigurements to be preserved. Scientists now believe humans looked like this, but evolved out of these traits due to finding 3 different skeletons from 3 different areas, with varying degrees of the mutation, and being some of the oldest human skeletons to be found.
Now, some questions...
* How can we prevent something like this, following false data, from happening today (how can we prevent confusing a genetic disorder from the past to represent how we got here today)?
* How do we know this hasn't happened already (what if some of the other Homo species are actually just flukes and have nothing to do with our evolution)?
* Because of this mutation, it causes eyesight, hearing, and brain damage. However, despite doctors believing Rocky shouldn't be able to learn well due to the brain damage, he still ended up graduating high school with honors. So, would we see these skeletons and come to the conclusion similar to that of the doctors? Could this mean that some of our beliefs about other Homo species learning capacities and brain functionality are potentially wrong?
* What about other deformities? Are there any that you believe or know of that have lead us down a wrong path?",20,1503606322,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6vtlib/okay_i_got_a_weird_hypothetical_situation/
DebateEvolution,6vsdjy,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Testable and inferences from assumptions,"[Nomenmeum](/u/Nomenmeum) is really fond of making two particular arguments [as in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6uv1hz/biogenesis_again_still_after_all_these_years/dlxgpdm/) but also many others:

1. evolution and abiogenesis are untestable.

2. evolution and abiogenesis produce explanations that are ""just"" inferences made from (naturalistic) assumptions.

I have two questions for him. Not that these will be addressed whatsoever, read my lips, but at least for the more honest debaters here an interesting issue.

First, if evolution and abiogenesis are untestable, why are creationist websites crammed with attempts to falsify them? Because if they were untestable, such attempts would be a priori impossible.

The second point is this: when we observe the fossil record, we clearly see that the biodiversities observed in the subsequent geological formations differ considerably. For instance, in the Cambrian entire classes and orders and genera of organisms are completely lacking. The next ones are completely absent in the Cambrian formations: all fish except the jawless ones, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and terrestial life forms except from bacterial mats. All life in the Cambrian formations is marine. 

This observation basically originates from the first geologists like Smith, Hutton, Lyell, Brognart, Cuvier, Buckland. And you really can't say these were men pre-occupied with naturalistic word views because apart from Smith (of whom we don't know his religious affiliation, which does not exclude he could well had been also a staunch believer), all of these were ardent believers and many of them even initially were adherents to ""catastrophism"", the geological paradigm that the geology we observe is mostly due to catastrophs like the biblical flood (not that they remained thinking so because the advancements in geological obserrvations directly falsifies this caboodle).

So, my second question would be: which inferences would Nomenmeum make from these observations OTHER than the only logical one, that is: the biodiversity has changed throughout the natural history of the Earth. And a changing biodiversity is nothing less than ... evolution.

DebateEvolution,6vgf6s,Dataforge,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationists and quote mining,"[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6v3hjq/evolutionists_say_the_oddest_things/) has been posted on our favourite subreddit. It's a video all about, as the title would suggest, quotes from evolutionists.

I won't bother going through the whole video, because that would take way too long. Instead I'll just address the highlights. But first, let's address quote mining in general.

Why is quote mining so popular among creationists? No actual science uses quote mines. Even other pseudosciences and conspiracy theories rarely quote mine. It's almost exclusively a creationist thing.

I believe part of the answer is how most scientists are skeptical of evolution. Before anyone tries to take that quote out of context, skepticism doesn't mean doubt. Good scientists are always skeptical of everything, especially their own disciplines. They are happy to honestly inquire about the weaknesses of their sciences. It's not hard for a dedicated movement to take these incidents of skepticism, and use them to claim doubt in evolution and its evidence.

There are a lot of good reasons why quote mines do not work as actual evidence. Most importantly, the data is what counts, not what scientists say. If a scientist says there are no transitional fossils, it doesn't mean a thing if we have actual examples of transitional fossils that anyone can see.

Second, most of these quotes are taken out of context. A good rule of thumb is to read the quote as it is, rather than what the quoters say it means. For example, this is the first quote in the video linked above:

&gt; I don’t think believing that Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection (his version or today’s version) commits you to religious belief. I think that if, as I myself would, you extend the scope of the theory to an understanding of knowledge acquisition and justification and the same for morality — evolutionary epistemology and evolutionary ethics — then it can act as a religion substitute or alternative. It gives you a world picture that some people, starting with me, find entirely satisfying.

The hosts claim the author is saying ""evolution is a religion"". But, is that really what it says? No. The exact words are ""it can act as a religion **substitute or alternative**"", not a religion itself. If you read the full article, [available here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ruse/is-darwinism-a-religion_b_904828.html), you will see the author is specifically saying that it's not a religion, just that, in some cases, it shares traits of religion.

Another thing to look out for is quotes by Stephen Jay Gould that mention gradualism, gradual evolution, or something of the sort. It's true that Stephen Jay Gould will say that there is no fossil evidence for gradual evolution. The layperson may believe that gradual evolution is all evolution, and Gould is saying there's no fossil evidence for evolution. This is false, because gradual evolution is actually a specific type of evolution, that Gould contrasts with punctuated equilibrium. He's not saying there's no fossil evidence for evolution, just one particular type of evolution.

When looking into a fair few of these quote mines, I noticed a lot of them can't be verified. A lot of them come from private letters, or one off lectures. If they were being honest, they would only stick to quotes that can be verified.

The last main reason that quote mines aren't actual evidence, is that individual scientist claims don't necessarily represent the consensus. There are hundreds of thousands of life scientists in America alone. There are no doubt a small minority who have unconventional beliefs about evolution, even if they don't identify as creationists. They might believe that dinosaurs didn't evolve into birds, or that evolution justifies genocide, or even that evolution is false.

Now onto the video's highlights:

We open with a statement that they're not taking quotes out of context. That would be nice, except their very first quote, described above, is taken out of context. What's particularly good is their explanation for why they aren't taking any of them out of context. They say ""They're not saying they're creationists, they still believe in evolution."" I don't even know where to begin on that one. What does claiming someone's a creationist or not have to do with being in context? Sure, if you're using the quote to say they're creationists it would be relevant, but what if you're using the quote to say evolution is a religion, or there are no transitional fossils, or evolution is baseless?

Another laugh comes when they say that they're putting the references to each quote, so you can look them up for yourself. We all know exactly zero creationists are going to be looking up any of these quotes. Even the makers of this video didn't look them up, which we know because the very first quote is out of context.

About half way into the video, it uses a quote by esteemed scientist, and bastion of mental health, Jeffrey Dahmer. That's right, creationists are using a deranged serial killer as an authority on evolution.

In one of the intermissions between quotes, they address scientists and engineers that mimic features found in nature. Of course, this goes on to a watchmaker argument. But what's really funny, they accuse the scientists that do this of plagiarism. That's right, they believe they're plagiarizing God.

That's about all I can stomach for now. I might post a few of these quotes they used later on, and address their dishonesty.",46,1503459971,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6vgf6s/creationists_and_quote_mining/

DebateEvolution,6uv1hz,Denisova,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Biogenesis again - still after all these years,"In the [echochamber](/r/creation) [Nomenmeum](/u/nomenmeum) is re-iterating the old canard again of [Pasteur's law of biogenesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6uikat/the_irrational_faith_of_evolutionnaturalism/dlswqdx/).

As usual we first have to deal with the habitual quote mining, in this case the sayings of George Wald, who *supposedly* wrote:

&gt; ""When it comes to the origin of life on this earth, there are only two possibilities: creation or spontaneous generation. There is no third way. Spontaneous generation was disproved 100 years ago, but that leads us only to one other conclusion: that of supernatural creation. We cannot accept that on philosophical grounds; therefore, we choose to believe the impossible: that life arose spontaneously by chance."" 

Which supposedly came from a 1958 article.

This quote is a complete fabrication. ""Quote"" is not even correct as a paraphrase here. Wald exactly said *the opposite*. It is often breathtaking how creationists manage to lay words in the mouth of scientists that turn out to be diametrically the opposite. This majestic dexterity in juggling is telling.

To prove how deceitful this quote mine is, I only have to quote one single line in Wald's 1958 article ""The Origin of Life,"" which actually appeared in the August 1954 (pages 44-53) issue of Scientific American:

&gt; I think a scientist has no choice but to approach the origin of life through a hypothesis of spontaneous generation. What the controversy reviewed above showed to be untenable is only the belief that living organisms arise spontaneously under present conditions. We have now to face a somewhat different problem: how organisms may have arisen spontaneously under different conditions in some former period, granted that they do so no longer.

But, apart from this habitual deceit, we still have Pasteur's law of biogenesis. Which is, frankly, an old canard.

And its irrelevance in explaining the origin of life by abiogenesis is not rocket science.

Pasteur experiments were on falsifying that modern, complex life can spontaneously originate from dead material. So here are the *conditions* of Pasteur's experiments:

1. modern life in its achieved complexity.

2. substrates: grape skins, broths and fermental liquids.

The spontaneous generation that Pasteur disproved was the idea that life forms such as mice, maggots, and bacteria in their extant, rather complex form can appear already fully formed from biologically derived food sources. 

So his conclusions are confined to *those* conditions. Expanding these results to complete other conditions is just lousy science and goes against abut all relevant metodological and logical rules.

They do not apply to *other* conditions, like those proposed by biologists pertaining the origin of life by natural means:

- the first life which is conceived to be much less complex.

- in pond or ocean water that does not contain biologically derived food sources but to an extent is saturated with the elementary biochemical building blocks of life. The abiotic forming of those elementary buildings blocks already has been demonstrated and isn't an issue any more.

You are not allowed to transplant the results of experiments to other conditions than the ones that were set for the experiment. There is no law of biogenesis implying that very primitive life cannot form from increasingly complex molecules.

Pasteur's experiment merely disproved a form of creationism though, because creationism is all about the generation of already complex life in its current forms out of nothing. Exactly what Pasteur falsified. And to justify this exception on the law of biogenesis, creationists only need to assume ""Poof!"" (=god busy creating). And it's even worse because creationism assumes that life, the world and cosmos were created *out of nothing* (""creatio ex nihilo"" it's called in theology) by an supernatural entity we by definition cannot observe or tell whether it actually exists. How plausible.

It is also breathtaking how creationists often ruin by own admission their stance - quote from CreationWiki (Sic!!! is mine):

&gt; This commentary on Pasteur’s work shows how someone can turn a person’s findings on its head to advocate their own position [**SIC!!!!!!**]. Biblical creationism admits that Deity would have the ability to form life fully formed at will. Since Pasteur’s work is limited to the natural world, the world of the adherent of naturalism, that is where it should remain. Statements about the ability of the supernatural cannot be derived from Louis Pasteur’s investigations. 

And that's another way of telling that creationism is pseudoscience because creationism DOES make statements about the natural world, namely how life, the world and universe originated and the diversity of life.

A few quick points.

 

Developmental biology can inform and support evolutionary theory not because organisms replay their evolutionary history during development, but because the more general characteristics of a group develop earlier, followed by the more specific characteristics. In evolutionary terms, this means that more ancestral (i.e. more ancient) traits tend to appear earlier, while more derived (i.e. more recent) traits tend to appear later.

So we can compare different organisms, and the degree to which they share traits at different stages of development *can be* informative with regard to the relative relatedness among different species or groups. 

 

For example, during vertebrate development, the notochord appears earlier than the vertebral column. So if you compare a vertebrate to say a cephalochordate very early on, they're going to look more alike than later in their respective developmental processes. 

 

Now, Haeckel had this other idea, that organisms replay their evolutionary history during development. That was wrong, we know it's wrong, and as somebody who teaching biology to college freshmen, I think I'm qualified to say that *nobody teaches Haeckel*. 

So when creationists bring up Haeckel in a debate about evolutionary biology, it's the equivalent of arguing ""yeah well they thought the sun orbited around the earth, so modern theories of astronomy are wrong"" in an astronomy debate. It has no bearing on the modern discussion, at all.

DebateEvolution,6r7t4v,comeback9,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Claims of a Creationist Trucker,"Brett here has a bunch of strong feelings about creationism and evolution. Please lay into them.
https://www.quora.com/profile/Brett-Passmore/log

Some examples:

On Geological Layering

>Respondent: ""The Grand Canyon is over 6,000 feet deep in places. It has neat, straight lines of geologic strata""

>Brett: Yes... VERY straight lines, indicating rapid deposition. There obviously was not vast amounts of time and erosion.

>Respondent: ""This itself (deep canyons) isn’t any sort of proof, since creating a deep canyon is possible in the abrahamic mythology.""

>Brett: Hmmmm... It seems you start with the conclusion the Bible is myth, then reject science which contradicts your bias. If you are familiar with the journal 'Nature', here is an article on rapid canyon formation. http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n7/full/ngeo894.html?foxtrotcallback=true

>Respondent: ""This little guy is a Trilobite. He was a sea creature, and is found in the lower layers of the canyon. He’s extinct. There’s no way he burrowed through millions of tons of rock, when he died there was a sea floor where he was. Layers built up over him after that.""

>Brett: Hmmm.. (again). Why are you arguing against something you don't understand... a strawman argument. Of course bottom dwelling marine creatures are in the lowest levels. And, actually the grand canyon fossils provide fantastic evidence of a catastrophic event and rapid burial. Trilobites have a very sophisticated vision system with no evidence of gradual step by step vision uphill evolution.

>Respondent: ""This, of course, debunks the 6,000 year old earth theory...""

>Brett: 6000 year old earth is a belief based on evidence. (Call it a theory if you wish)

>Respondent: ""since at this point it would take a foot of buildup per year to grow the canyon to it’s current size""

>Brett: Steven, you are tilting at windmills. Rather than create arguments you think you can defeat, why not learn your 'oppositions' views, so you can argue more effectively?

>Respondent: ""(not counting the time the river takes to cut through it,""

>Brett: So, do you think the Colorado river ran uphill and carved the canyon over millions of years?

>Respondent: ""Well, the fossils stop being undersea fossils after a while. We get animal tracks and plants a little ways up.""

>Brett: The Grand Canyon fossils and layers are excellent evidence supporting the creation model and rapid burial and preservation.

>Respondent: ""The problem there is that fossils don’t exist for just extinct species. They exist for extant (things still living) species as well. We can tell when a creature first appeared by seeing where it’s fossil record starts.""

>Brett: That belief, (where creatures start and stop in the fossil record)has lead to a number of false and sometimes embarassing conclusions by evolutionists. For example coelacanths were not a fish in shallow ancient seas with stubby limbs, and primitive lungs, that went extinct 65 million years ago. They live today deep in the ocean..no limbs...no lungs...and not extinct.

>Respondent: ""There are ZERO extant species in these lower layers. There are no modern sea creatures with the trilobites.""

>Brett: Modern jellyfish would be one example proving you wrong. They appear the same as fossilized jellyfish dated at 500MY. We can look at the lower geological levels and see the sudden appearance of many, many organisms with NO evidence of gradual transitions and increasing complexity. And we see extinctions consistent with the Biblical model.

>Respondent: ""...You find these layers everywhere, and everywhere you don’t find modern species or even modern kinds""

>Brett:Actually we do find some modern creatures buried in layers that surprise evolutionists. Invariably the fossil is assigned as a different species, not based on science but beliefs. The word species has rubbery definitions but usually it involves the organisms ability to mate with other similar creatures. For example, quite a few birds similar to modern birds have been found in dinosaur layers. According to evolutionists, if it walks like a duck, and looks like a duck...it isn't a duck if its in the 'wrong' layer.

>Respondent: ""If people existed on the sixth day, we’d see evidence of people in deeper layers.""

>Brett: No... humans and trilobites have 'slightly' different environments. Likewise we don't expect monkeys to be buried with fish during a flood. Also... from God's Word, we wonder if there is no such thing as pre-flood human fossils, since God said He would destroy humans from the face of the earth, other than those on the ark.

On Archaeopteryx

> Archaeoptetyx was a bird... feathers like todays birds and capable of flight. It did have some unique traits...but MANY birds have unique traits.  An article in  Scientific American tells us that archaeoptetyx feathers seem to have appeared in a flash... its a miracle! "" Archaeopteryx seemed to emerge fully fledged with the characteristics of modern birds,” said Michael Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in England...To explain this miraculous metamorphosis..."" https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dinosaurs-shrank-and-became-birds/

On ERVs in apes

>Questioner: ""Okay, what ERVs are not consistent with evolutionary hierarchies?""

>Brett: Example... ""We performed two analyses to determine whether these 12 shared map intervals might indeed be orthologous. First, we examined the distribution of shared sites between species (Table S3). We found that the distribution is inconsistent with the generally accepted phylogeny of catarrhine primates. This is particularly relevant for the human/great ape lineage."" Lineage-Specific Expansions of Retroviral Insertions within the Genomes of African Great Apes but Not Humans and Orangutans

On the Fossil Record

>Brett: We find fossilized pollen, jellyfish, modern vascular plants, giant ferns, whole dinosurs in the drowning position, footprints, Soft dino tissue in fossils, turtles 'doing it', feeding fish, fossilized whale pod, birds and mammals in dino tummies and more. The fossil record provides excellent evidence for sudden appearance of all basic kinds, and a catastrophic event where there was sudden burial in waterborne sediment.

On ""Junk DNA""

>Brett: ""Pseudogenes have long been labeled as ""junk"" DNA, failed copies of genes that arise during the evolution of genomes. However, recent results are challenging this moniker; indeed, some pseudogenes appear to harbor the potential to regulate their protein-coding cousins. Far from being silent relics, many pseudogenes are transcribed into RNA, some exhibiting a tissue-specific pattern of activation. Pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs that regulate coding genes through the RNAi pathway. In another remarkable discovery, it has been shown that pseudogenes are capable of regulating tumor suppressors and oncogenes by acting as microRNA decoys. The finding that pseudogenes are often deregulated during cancer progression warrants further investigation into the true extent of pseudogene function. In this review, we describe the ways in which pseudogenes exert their effect on coding genes and explore the role of pseudogenes in the increasingly complex web of noncoding RNA that contributes to normal cellular regulation"" The article closes with warning similar to what creationists have been saying for years not to assume that pseudogenes are ""nonfunctional relics""because that has caused them to be ""overlooked in the quest to understand the biology of health and disease"":  RNA, Vol. 17:792-798 (2011).

>Respondent: ""Transposons do literally nothing but copy themselves and screw up the genes they insert themselves into. Maybe, just maybe it can result in something useful. More likely it will just mess things up.""

>Brett: You seem to use old evolutionist arguments from 20 years ago, that science has disproven. Your argument about transposons are no different than the old junk DNA, and psuedogene arguments. Science is still in the process of revealing purpose and function in transposons... such as molecular switch functions.

General Summation

>Respondent: ""Believe me, if there was a article that, with clear scientific methodology and sound statistics shows that the theory of evolution is wrong, it would be all over the high ranking journals!""

>Brett: No... sorry, I don't believe that. When a secular journal prints anything with even a hint at intelligent design, their subcrscribers complain. Likewise 'Journal of Creation' does not accept articles that promote common ancestry.

>Respondent: ""Let’s start at the very basic principles and work our way up. What’s a mutation? - A change in the DNA.""

>Brett: It's more than just a change...its a copying error...its a mistake. I'm sure you are aware of many secular articles where geneticists express concern about the accumulation of these mistakes in our genome. Geneticist Crow says "" each mutation leads to one genetic death"". He says that the mildly deleterious mutations ""has no overt effect but shows up as a small decrease in viability or fertility"". (http://www.pnas.org/content/94/16/8380.full)

>Respondent: ""Let’s say you have just DNA floating around with nothing else but the machinery to copy it.

>Brett: So...if I understand correctly, you want to assume a strand of useless DNA?

>Respondent: ""Now let’s go a step further. Let’s say, the DNA actually codes for something. ..... Now we can have three more types of mutations! They are called silent, nonsense and missense mutations. ""

>Brett: I feel like you are trying to sell something when you suggest mutations are / can be 'silent' . Geneticists refer to mutations as ""mildly deleterious""...""genetic death""....""very slightly deleterious""...""near neutral"".... etc. AND.... it is these type of mutations that geneticists are most concerned with. For ex. Higgins and Lynch said that because mildly deleterious mutations are almost invisible to natural selection that they make great considerably larger mutational load (http://m.pnas.org/content/98/5/2928.full) Or, mathematician Hoyle in 'Mathematics of Evolution says "" natural selection cannot turn back deleterious mutations if they are small, and over a long time a large number of small disadvantages escalate to a serious handicap"".

>Respondent: ""....Same story with bacteria: I’m sure you must have heard of antibiotic resistance.""

>Brett: Yes, I have heard of that. :) Bacteria are wee bit different from us to make comparisons re mutations, adaptation etc.
I will give the creationist perspective. Life on earth; our existence depends on many many types of bacteria. We can't live without them. Bacteria need to be able to rapidly adapt to chaging environments. Bacteria are able to exchange genetic info in unique ways, which seems to be a designed response. Their reproductive rate allows them to survive a high mutation rate. Although most bacteria is good and neccesary, a small percentage has become harmful which is consistent with the good creation, which is now subject to entropy

>Respondent: ""Just as in the song about Rudolph the reindeer: The Reindeer might have a mutation that causes red glowing noses, which under normal reindeer conditions is considered “bad” as he’s been made fun of. But in the condition of heavy fog, he is now, without competition the only useful reindeer.""

>Brett: Haha....cute analogy. :)

>Respondent: ""Here’s a great article (published really highly) of a fellow researcher whose presentation I heard at a conference recently: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v539/n7627/full/nature19824.html

>Brett: Re.that study, geneticist Tompkins says ""This study is just yet one more shining example of how looking at the genome as a product of evolution hinders scientific discovery. If scientists were to view the genome for what it is, an unimaginably complex engineered system designed by an Omnipotent Creator, scientific discovery would be considerably more productive because scientists would be looking for intended purpose and function rather than accidents of evolution."" http://www.icr.org/article/pseudo-pseudogenes-shake-up-evolutionary/",30,1501712204,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6r7t4v/claims_of_a_creationist_trucker/

This all came from a single experiment where researchers would generate thousands of randomised DNA sequences and then insert them along with their necessary replication machinery into the genomes of E-coli.

In an article about the study, one of the researchers recounts:

&gt; During my early months in the Tautz lab, while still a Master’s student, I contemplated the possibility of doing an experiment that could support de novo evolution as a general process, and so I came up with a thought experiment. I would insert random sequences in living cells, together with enough regulatory machinery to make sure they would be transcribed and translated by the host. Then, I would wait until any of those would mutate enough to “acquire a function.” It occurred to me that starting with a sufficiently large pool of random sequences would reduce the waiting time, because some would exhibit some biochemical activity upon their introduction.

The results were surprising - they generated hundreds of randomized genes that were beneficial to the bacteria that received them. In some cases the new functional genes acted at the RNA level, and in other cases through the new protein that was produced.

&gt; Our experiments show that an unexpectedly large fraction of random RNA or peptide sequences are bioactive, at least in the sense of influencing relative growth rates in E. coli cells. The results imply that it could be either the RNA itself, or the corresponding translated protein that conveys the bioactivity. Although two of our three individually tested clones suggest that the RNA function could be more important than the protein function, this constitutes at present only a small sample and may not be indicative of the true ratio between RNA and peptide functions. However, this observation fits well with the notion that an active RNA may precede an active peptide during de novo gene evolution of genes

I felt like giving my comments to this because some of the answers seem to be wrong (or incomplete) and I wanted the input of you guys.

&gt; Question 5: A mutation can be which of the following?

Eye rolling at the possible answers good/bad. Please stick with unbiased terminology and use beneficial/detrimental.

Also, obviously, /r/Creation doesn't accept that mutations can be beneficial. At this point, I don't care to repeat it again and again.


&gt; Question 6: In what molecules do hereditary mutations occur?

DNA is the only one where hereditary **mutations** occur, and transgenerational inheritance is an alternative option.

&gt; * It wanted me to say DNA is the only molecule of inheritance.  [Not true](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6308/59.full).

This is where /u/JohnBerea got it wrong over at the /r/Creation thread. Epigenetics doesn't work via mutations. He misunderstood the question, but really it's a minor mistake.

&gt; Question 9: What animal shares 99% of the human genome?

The problem of ambiguity. The question ""What animal shares 99% of the human genome *on sequence level*?"" would have been better and less ambiguous. /r/Creation realized that too.

&gt; Question 17: Vestigial structures, or body parts that no longer have a function...

I prefer to use the less ambiguous term for vestigial -&gt; reduced.

&gt; Question 18: Can DNA be obtained from a fossil?

The quiz says **no**. This is a tricky one, fossils with soft tissue are also usually called [subfossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil):

&gt; A subfossil (as opposed to a fossil) is a bone or other part of an organism that has not fully fossilized.

So a subfossil, according to wikipedia, does not seem to be under the category of fossils. However, neanderthal findings as well as the DNA belong to the fossil record. Contradictory? What do you guys think? Imho the article got it wrong.


&gt; Question 20: How do Neanderthals fit into human history?

Answer: They interbred with homo sapiens [...]

&gt; Wrong Answer!

&gt; Neanderthals were early members of the human race, **but modern humans don't appear to have Neanderthals in their ancestry. **

DebateEvolution,6mose7,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationist Claim: ERVs don't support common ancestry because reasons.,"I’ve been keeping an eye on [this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6ka61r/microbiologist_andrew_fabich_crituqes_ervs_as/) announcing a webinar critiquing ERVs as evidence for common ancestry. A few days ago [the video](https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.mclatchie/videos/10155087811921943/) was made available, so naturally I not only sat through this train wreck, but took notes. 

So why don’t ERVs support common ancestry? Let’s find out!

&amp;nbsp;

Objection 1. ERVs have functions, therefore their location is due to selection rather than chance.

Can you name an example of a functional ERV? Go to about 1:27:15 or so remaining for the amazing answer.

He fumbles for a moment, and final comes up with…syncytins! Except that **isn’t a functional ERV.** Syncytins are genes acquired from retroviruses via horizontal gene transfer. They are not functional ERVs.

(Seriously, this is amazing. This is the most obvious question one should expect in this situation. Did he just not prepare, or are there really no actual examples? My money is on both.)

Any other examples? Nope. Just some vague hand-waving about how we see functions when we look. 

&amp;nbsp;

Objection 2: Evolution won’t preserve nonfunctional DNA, so ERVs must have a function. 

Wrong. Selection will preserve neutral features. As long as there is no cost to keeping ERVs and other classes of junk DNA (and therefore no advantage to losing it), it’ll just hang out. 

&amp;nbsp;

Objection 3: Something about just replacing some other protein – I’ve never heard this argument and I don’t really understand the point he was trying to make. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then something I’m not sure is an objection, about how target site duplication as a hallmark of integration – “that’s just how retroviruses work.” So wait he acknowledges they’re inserted viruses, it’s just specific in some way and therefore designed. No evidence of some invisible guiding hand behind the processes is provided. 

&amp;nbsp;

Obejction 4: Even though phylogenies generated using ERVs correlate strongly to other phylogenies, it’s not an argument for common ancestry, because…

* you can’t tell when they inserted (false – age is correlated with LTR length, for example).

* it might be due to convergence (sure, it *might*. And unicorns might be real).

* you can’t say which species got insertion first (it’s the common ancestor of the species that have a homologous ERV. He doesn’t get how common ancestry works, it seems).

* you get different trees if you use different parts of the genome (yes? that’s why you don’t cherry-pick, you use as much data as you can).

&amp;nbsp;

There’s more discussion in this video, but it wanders into other topics, including a cameo by Sal f’ing Cordova, and some evidence-free discussion of dinosaurs on the ark. But that’s really it for ERVs. Nothing new. And almost nothing factually correct. Total amateur hour.

It's this thread: [I have a probably silly question. Maybe you folks can help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6li54u/i_have_a_probably_silly_question_maybe_you_folks/)

This is the key part of the OP: 

&gt;I've heard often that two of each animals on the ark wouldn't be enough to further a specie. I'm wondering how this would work.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, it comes down to this: How do you go from two individuals to all of the diversity we see, in like 4000 years? 

&gt;The problem with this is that under Mendelian principles of inheritance, not allowing for the possibility of information-adding mutations, you can only have at most four different alleles for any given gene locus.

&gt;That's not what we see - there are often dozens of different alleles for a particular gene locus. That is not consistent with ancestry traced to only a pair of individuals.

So...either we don't have recent descent from two individuals, and/or evolution can generate novel traits.

Yup!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;There are lots of genes where mutations have created many degraded variants. And it used to be argued that HLA genes had too many variants before it was discovered new variants arose rapidly through gene conversion. But which genes do you think are too varied?

And we have another mechanism: Gene conversion! Other than the arbitrary and subjective label ""degraded,"" they're doing a great job making a case for evolution. 

&amp;nbsp;

And then this last exchange in this subthread:

&gt;If humanity had 4 alleles to begin with, but then a mutation happens and that allele spreads (there are a lot of examples of genes with 4+ alleles that is present all over earth) than this must mean that the mutation was beneficial, right? If there's genes out there with 12+ alleles than that must mean that at least 8 mutations were beneficial and spread.

Followed by

&gt;Beneficial or at least non-deleterious. It has been shown that sometimes neutral mutations fixate just due to random chance.

Wow! So now we're adding fixation of neutral mutations to the mix as well. Do they all count as ""degraded"" if they're neutral?

&amp;nbsp;

To recap, the mechanisms proposed here to explain how you go from two individuals to the diversity we see are mutation, selection, drift (neutral theory FTW!), and gene conversion (deep cut!). 

If I didn't know better, I'd say the creationists are making a case *for* evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: u/JohnBerea continues to do so in this thread, arguing, among other things, that new phenotypes can appear without generating lots of novel alleles simply due to recombination and dominant/recessive relationships among alleles for quantitative traits (though he doesn't use those terms, this is what he describes), and that HIV has accumulated ""only"" several thousand mutations since it first appeared less than a century ago.

DebateEvolution,6m4lvk,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"I got a question about genetic entropy, so gather 'round, and let me tell you why the ""genetic entropy"" argument is nonsense","Genetic entropy. One of my favorite topics. Get comfy, this turned out to be much longer than I thought it would be. I got a question about this in a PM, and I figure I might as well share the answer with everyone. So next time you hear this nonsense, this is why it's nonsense. 

&amp;nbsp;

That term, ""genetic entropy,"" is, as far as I can tell, a term made up by creationists to make evolutionary theory seem impossible. It is defined as the accumulation of harmful mutations to the point where a species suffers such a high fitness cost that it goes extinct. 

&amp;nbsp;

The actual term for what they're trying to describe is ""error catastrophe,"" which is when harmful mutations accumulate at a rate the eventually causes the average rate of reproduction in a population to fall below 1 (meaning less than 1 offspring per individual), so the population shrinks and eventually goes extinct. 

Error catastrophe requires a very specific set of conditions. Mutations have to accumulate at a sufficient rate. A sufficient percentage of mutations have to be harmful. And selection and recombination working together have to be unable to clear the harmful mutations. In other words, the mutations have to happen faster than natural selection can cause the genomes *without* the harmful mutations to increase in frequency.

&amp;nbsp;

These conditions are so rare and specific that they have never, *never* been observed in natural populations. We think some kinds of viruses mutate fast enough to be pretty close to the threshold, but nothing is actually experiencing error catastrophe. We know this because we can measure the reproductive rate in whatever population you want to study, and we find that none are below 1, and when we measure, for example, these viruses in the lab, they don't ""slow down"" over time. 

&amp;nbsp;

There is the idea that we can induce error catastrophe by treating fast-mutating populations with a mutagen. This has been tried a number of times, but it's never been conclusively shown to work. Ever. You can find studies that *claim* to have induced error catastrophe, but they are lacking. [This](http://www.genetics.org/content/195/2/541) is a good overview of this body of research. 

The thing is, fast-mutating viruses like RNA viruses or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the ideal organisms to target for lethal mutagenesis. They have small, dense genomes (&gt;90% of the bases are within protein-coding regions), and in some cases, overlapping offset reading frames, so there aren't even wobble sites. So a high percentage of mutations ought to be harmful. If this is going to work in any organisms, it's these viruses. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now look at humans. We have genomes that are *much* less dense. about 2% protein-coding, and about 10% functional in total. So a much, much lower percentage of human mutations will be harmful. How much less? Well, figure 90% are neutral because they occur in non-functional regions. Of the remaining 10%, some occur in regions or at sites that don't require base specificity, only that a base is present - wobble sites or spacer DNA, for example. Mutations to these bases will also be neutral. That's going to be not quite a third of the coding DNA (there can be selection for synonymous codons, but it's really, really weak, so we're just going to call that neutral. Because it's so weak we can't measure the effects. Source: I've tried.), plus a ton of the functional-but-not-coding DNA, since so much of it is spacer or structural. So we're looking at low-to-mid single digits for the percentage of mutations that are actually harmful in humans. 

But then you add in the effects of sexual reproduction and recombination. These allow us to decouple good mutations from bad ones, allowing the bad mutations to be removed via natural selection (i.e. individuals with bad mutations have lower reproductive success), meaning these mutations don't accumulate from generation to generation. 

&amp;nbsp;

The argument creationists use in response to the above is that there are mutations called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" or VSDMs. Mutations that are harmful, but have such small effects that selection cannot remove them. So they accumulate over time and cause a decline in reproductive output over many many generations. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are a lot of problems with this argument. Let's go through them.

First, fitness effects are context dependent. There are very few mutations that are inherently, universally beneficial or harmful. Fitness effects depend on the genetic and ecological context in which they occur. So if a mutation has no fitness effects, it isn't a VSDM. It's neutral. Period. 

Second, for VSDMs to be the drivers of error catastrophe, they have to accumulate slowly enough to not be subject to selection, but also rapidly enough to drive a decrease in fitness. But these two things cannot simultaneously occur. If they cause a decline in fitness, then the individuals with the VSDMs have fewer offspring, and those mutations become *less* common. Which means that in order for error catastrophe to happen, a large number of mutations have to occur in a single generation. But...

Third, if harmful mutations were accumulating, either very slowly or in a big burst, we'd see the effects: Reproductive output would decline. Needless to say, the number of humans keeps increasing. There is zero evidence of a global decline in fitness. Localized decreases in reproductive output are due to choices, not physiology. 

&amp;nbsp;

So where does that leave ""genetic entropy""? Without a leg to stand on. It hasn't even been induced in the fastest mutating organisms on earth, with genomes that are perfect target for it. Given the lower density, lower mutation rates, and sexual reproduction in humans, there's zero chance we're experiencing error catastrophe. And the icing on the cake is the contradiction it requires to work: The mutations have to have effects so minor, selection cannot act on them (i.e. they are neutral), but they also have to be harmful enough to cause not just a measurable decline in fitness over time, but a *terminal* decline in fitness over time. Those two things cannot simultaneously happen. 

The genetic entropy argument is nonsense from top to bottom. ",70,1499561274,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6m4lvk/i_got_a_question_about_genetic_entropy_so_gather/

Overall Positions

1 - The debate between Evolution and Creation is not a debate about Science vs Religion.  It is a debate about the correct history of the planet, specifically Uniformitarianism vs Catastrophism.

**Geological**

Evidence #1: The eruption of Mt. St. Helens produced 350,000 to 2,000,000 year old rocks although they were actually born in 1980.  

Position#1 - This shows a limitation of certain types of Radiometric Dating.

Evidence #2 - The eruption and subsequent activity surrounding this eruption carved a 600 foot channel carved into bedrock within a couple of days.  

Position - This is a powerful example of the capabilities of Catastrophism, and large scale events could feasibly carve out the Grand Canyon in geologically short time frames.

Option #1 Colorado River cut the grand canyon over eons
Option #2 Hopee Buttes filled with water, and then breached, flowing west and carving the grand canyon quickly.

Evidence #3 The Great unconformity has been found Continent wide in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa.  This erosional boundary represents 1/2 a Billion years.  Because it is so widespread, you would expect to see uniform deposition for future layers.  However, the Schnebly Hill formation which is 800 to 1,000 feet think is not found in the Grand Canyon which is only 70 miles away.  
Position:  Because the Great Unconformity and the greater Sauk Megasequence cover most of North America including the Grand Canyon and surrounding areas; according to uniformitarian theory we should see the Schnebly hill formation in the Grand Canyon.  Since we do not see this, further evidence in the area points to catastrophism as the logical explanation (see below)

Evidence #4 We find Crossbedding with angles of 15 to 25 degrees the 200,000 square miles of the Coconino Sandstone around the grand canyon and surrounding areas.  

Position - This is consistent with underwater deposition.  If this had been deposited like desert sand dunes we would be looking at 30 to 34 degree crossbedding.

**Conventional Paradigm**

Evolution requires being built from the simplest to the most complex.  Creation supposes design with complexity built into the original design.

Position:  The Cambrian Explosion, and the appearance of the dinosaurs as fully formed is an example of complexity from the beginning, not simplicity.

**Paleontological**

Evidence #5: Nautloid fossil beds show entire ecosystems were deposited catastrophically.  This clip is not part of the movie, but I have heard this argument before, and would like a rebuttal, as I have yet to hear a single evolutionary refutation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aNlb3lFhFM

Evidence #6 Animal trackways found, footprints first and bodyparts later.  This indicates Layering had to happen quickly, death and fossilization in an instant.  

Position - Fossilization occurred very quickly, indicating catastrophism... evidence has been shown globally.  I have also heard this argument before... sometimes cited with a fossil that was pregnant or giving birth... indicating quick burial. 

Evidence #7 - In the Lance formation we have 5,000 to 10,000 animals buried.  Little bones on top, Big Bones on the bottom.

Position - This shows catastrophic emplacement.  Dinosaurs look like dinosaurs from the beginning, with complexity.

**Biological**

Evidence #8 Triceratops horn from Hellcreek formation in Montana, soaked in EDT - 80, contained intact collagen and other protein fibers that were stretchy and pristine.  This fossil bed was anything but ideal conditions, and yet survival is impressive.

Position - With those terrible conditions, it is unlikely for this tissue to have survived for 60+Million years.  

Evidence #9 In the Fossil record there are not just missing links between Humans and human ancestors, there are missing links between literally everything that we see, and their supposed ancestors.

Position - This is to be expected within a creationist paradigm, and is a direct challenge to fossil evidentiary support of evolution.  

Evidence #10 Neanderthal Skull - Low forhead, midface is pulled out.  Looks very human Lands on the Human side  
Position - Ostralopithacus africanus - no forehead, face sloped forward. - Is not human. contains discontinuity.

Evidence #11 - The color of the Oryx of the Sahara desert blend perfectly into their surroundings.
Position - The ability to fit an environment must be built into a system before it starts.

Evidence #12 - We see a tremendous amount of mutualism/interdependance in ecosystems.  When we remove only a couple factors, the entire system breaks down.
Position - Creationism would allow interdependance to occur at the highest level of complexity, from the beginning.  Evolution does not allow for initial complexity, and certain ecosystems would not have been able to function.

Evidence #13 DNA is 4 dimensional.  It contains not only a long string of nucleotides in 1 dimension, but contains interactions in 2 dimensions, then folds in 3d in order to produce, for example, a protein that kills a toxin... and this occurs over time which is the 4th dimension.  This is Dynamic 4D DNA programming... this requires everything to be working properly all at once which is extremely complex.  

Position: This complexity could not be built one letter at a time.

Evidence #14 Random small changes in Computer code does not result in increasing complexity of the system, but corruption.  

Position:  Systems need to be designed from the beginning with the ability to adapt to the environment, developing complexity or true novelty (something not previously seen or not from a genetic background) based on random mutation has not been demonstrated.  


**Astronomical**

Evidence #15 - A solar eclipse is a phenomenon that only happens on planet earth.
Position - This is not a coincidence.  In the same way intelligent life has not been found on any other planet in the Universe.

Evidence #16 The ring systems of certain planets show a young age.
Position - They are young, and should not be there.

**Archaeological**

Evidence #17 According to Douglas Petrovich we see a Post Babel dispersion- In and around Eridu where different languages pop up out of nowhere, with a great diversity.  Similar architecture found all over the globe... Ziggurats.

Position - This is indicative of consistency with the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel and the dispersion of people groups and new language creation.

***OF COURSE*** nobody from the echochamber bothered to react to my post. When you do not like the observations, you just ""La, la, la, f#ck you, didn't read that"" skip them or feign they do not exist.

In my language there's a proverb, freely translated: those who keep silent often tell the truth.

So I just LOVE to elaborate so now and then further on the *actual* and *relevant* evidence of evolution (instead of the strawmen, ignoring and distortions by creationists).

This case: snakes.

According to the Bronze Age mythology scribblings, snakes lost their limbs as punishment by God after having lured Eva into the Fall. Apart from this being utter, infantile nonsense - how would a sensible god punish a SNAKE, an animal without any self-consciousness and thus not be held responsible for its deeds, snakes DO NOT EVEN perform deeds, they behave according to their imprinted instincts and reflexes - and when the Snake in the Garden of Eden was supposed to be possessed by Satan, why then not cursing Satan instead of the poor animal - let alone all of its congeners that weren't even involved in the case - this crap deserves only [to be mocked and ridiculed](https://youtu.be/J8lTLhx7f1c?t=10m25s).

So let's have what science tells about snakes losing their limbs.

We already know from [the fossil record](https://pterosaurheresies.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/pontosaurus_kornhuberi_10002.jpg) that snakes [evolved from limbed animals](https://www.livescience.com/51649-four-legged-snake-fossil.html).

[Many extant species of skinks](https://etb-visual-evolution.blogspot.nl/2012/05/snakes-with-legs-snake-evolution.html) have very rudimentary legs left they can't use anymore for the primary purpose of legs locomotion)- because they are too small and feeble in proportion to the very long body shape. These extant species are on the verge of losing their limbs as well. They are transitional species right among us.

Then we have snakes species [with vestigial legs](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u3SSuL7EdxmKWpd-BuViRKP9g8Ml-ZaaZPd18OC-1jLDVV0BZgV3f9ggilDZJux9YEquWbirejlhxs7-vP7-NXt5Xg=s0-d). Those snake species retain pelvic girdles and small rudiments of the femur. 

But a recent study nails it even harder. In [their 2016 article](https://tinyurl.com/ybola88d) ""Loss and Re-emergence of Legs in Snakes by Modular Evolution of Sonic hedgehog and HOXD Enhancers"", biologists Francisca Leal and Marty Cohn study the embryology and genetics of snake limb development, nicely summarized in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R928fGoiZQE). What they found is nothing more than evolution before our own eyes.

Legless lizard species already are observed [to develop rudimentary limbs during early embryonic gestation](https://evolutionforskeptics.wordpress.com/2015/10/23/ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny-legless-lizard-embryos-have-hind-limb-buds/). 

Leal and Cohn tracked the genetic activity in embryonic pythons to see why their legs start, but never finish, developing. In all tetrapods the outgrow of limbs is ruled by the activity of a gene named Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). This gene is switched on and off by an enhancer, called ZRS. With modern techniques it's possible to highlight cells in an embryo that are active in any stage of embryonic gestation. This way can observe genes switching on and off by the affected cell groups signaling or petering out again. In the python embryos they studied, they literally observed the Sonic Hedgehog gene flickering on very briefly in python embryos less than 24 hours long. In [this video fragment](https://youtu.be/OMKRNhl8s0c?t=1m50s) this is nicely demonstrated.

Leal and Cohn found that it was not the Sonic Hedgehog gene that was affected by mutations [but the ZRS](https://youtu.be/OMKRNhl8s0c?t=1m20s). These mutations hindered the ZRS to maintain SHH activity. They also found that the whole genetic machinery, in tetrapods responsible for the outgrow of hind limbs (SHH, ZRS, Hand2, HOXD13, HOXA13 and others), is still sitting in the python's genome. Also the onset of hind limb outgrow occurs, like the forming of the ZPA and AER zones (the first 2 structures that subsequently differentiate the different limb parts), only to be arrested later. Only three mutations on the ZRS sequence impairs the decent outgrow of hind limbs.

Leal and Cohn also analyzed these three deleted sites on ZRS biochemically and they found that these indeed were binding sites for Hox proteins. Next they asked themselves whether the impaired ZRS sites indeed were responsible for dysfunctionality in hind limb outgrowth by substituting the native ZRS in mouse embryos by the ZRS of pythons as well as anole lizards as control group. [They found](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=3m16s) that the mouse embryos grew perfectly well developed hind limbs when their ZRS was substituted by anole lizard ZRS but were malformed - resulting in only some tiny buds - when substituted by python ZRS.

But they also found two other remarkable things after further investigation: the HOXA13 and HOXB13 genes in pythons are particularly well conserved. These genes are responsible for [the outgrowth of the distal parts of the hind leg](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=3m58s): the feet and toes. The HOXA13 and HOXB13 activity in python embryos leads to the premature but basic formation of the autopod region (everything from the ankle to the toes and in between). Which is quite remarkable when the animal doesn't grow legs in the first place. That's like starting to build an attic and roof while forgetting the ground floor and basement of a house.

The second remarkable discovery was that in python embryos in early stages of gestation, cartilage begins to condensate in a fashion where [you can clearly observe the contours of the femur, fibula, tibia and autopod being formed](https://youtu.be/R928fGoiZQE?t=5m6s). These cartilage structures don't persist in further embryonic gestation but clearly shows how far pythons progress in embryonic hind limb development.

In snakes that do not have any limbs left, also not the vestiges species like boas and pythons still have, the ZRS is much more heavily mutated, often almost close to entire randomization.

Now the burning question here of course is: what is a legless animal doing with an almost intact genetic substrate for growing hind legs in the first place?

/u/4chantothemax posted several inaccurate statements regarding Archaeopteryx.

1. Archaeopteryx did not have perching feet:

2: it's skeletal structure is very, very different from a modem bird.
 
3. Equating emus (genus Dromiaus) with ostriches (genus struthio) and arguing that both have similar wing anatomy.

It strikes me that creationists have poor understanding of animal anatomy and it's functions. They also never seem to address sexual selection or attempt to explain it. It's quite frustrating when a layman like myself can research this stuff and they simply don't seem to bother. They don't understand simple paleontology and skeletons at all by appearances!

Also, I would have loved to see an answer to the refutations of the Flood. I really would love an explanation for how whales out flew/swam pterosaurs. The mental image of hovering whales flitting about like hummingbirds with their flippers will keep me in stitches for some time.

Time Frame:

    ~~Origin of the Earth	5 billion years~~ (not germane to evolution of phyla)
    ~~Bacteria and algae		3 billion years~~ (we're not discussing abiogenesis here)
    Filamentous algae		2 billion years

    Fish, land plants		400 million
    Amphibians			300 million
    Dinosaurs			200 million
    Mammals			150 million
    Primates			20 million

The problem is that the more complicated species became, the less time it took to evolve. Wouldn't the logical thing be that more complicated things take MORE time to evolve? Also, once you hit large organisms such as amphibians, reptiles, etc, the reproductive time is so long that there wouldn't have been enough generations to do all of this evolving. 

How do you guys understand this and explain it? Is there anything more of an explanation than something like this: *""Wow, it was really hard to get all of the building blocks correct to go from a prokaryote to a eukaryote. The rest of the evolution was dead easy""* ?

Well, I said that I would get back and comment here (videlicet https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6i9qzn/creationist_claim_there_is_no_proof_that_random/dj4v0yk/) and I've been thinking ...

I don't think that /r/debateEvolution is actually useful for debating. People say that ""the best predictor of future performance is past performance"", and ""those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it"". Every argument I make is basically answered with ""That's An Argument From Ignorance"" - an accusation that I categorically reject, but see no point in discussing further. It is so false and unwarranted that, sometimes I go crazy and overreact (link above). Occasionally there's also  the ""god of the gaps"" accusation thrown in too, but I see that accusation as being far more applicable to evolution than to intelligent design.  I'm just tired of going around in circles and getting nowhere so I'm not going to engage here anymore. I do realize that Reddit is not always the best place to have discussions and that maybe a discussion with some of you would be more productive in person at a cafe somewhere.

The only way that this subreddit serves any purpose for me is that I can ask questions about evolution and someone will normally answer them. The high point of my interactions here (so far) was the discussion that led to us understanding how a single loop circulatory system (2 chambered fish heart) could topologically be modified step by step into a double loop circulatory system (3 chambered amphibian heart). (And no, while I am tickled pink that this is possible when I had thought that there was no way that it could ever happen, I don't actually think that it happened that way.)  I'll post questions periodically when I want to understand how you see things. 

I have a suggestion for you (plural). Why don't you spend a month thinking that evolution cannot be correct and that the ubiquitous appearance of design in nature is in fact what Occam's razor would suggest: that nature has indeed been designed by some intelligent being (higher than humans). If a month is too long, try a week.  Why not spend this time trying to find problems, errors and flaws in evolution? They are in fact there (just as there are flaws in ID and possibly even more in the subset of ID called creationism).  It seems evident that most of you cannot see these flaws given the way that you currently approach things. Or maybe not. There are a number of evolutionists who are looking at these problems and trying to come up with ways to salvage the theory and maybe you are following along with them.

Thanks.

DebateEvolution,6izvca,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,Why the fossil record is evidence for evolution.,"A couple of weeks ago there was [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6fpjr7/creationist_claim_evolutionary_theory_is_not/) where /u/4chantothemax challenged everyone to present evidence for evolution, to which I presented the general order of the fossil record. There was a lot of good discussion in that thread, that was unfortunately cut off. I'd like to present the conclusions from that discussion, and give the users here a chance to discuss something that isn't nitpicking about molecular biology terminology.

**Summary of the argument:**

The fossil record is, in my opinion, the best piece of evidence for evolution. It's simple to understand, and as far as I've seen, there is no way to explain it besides evolution. It's pretty hard to deny that fossil record shows a progression of life. Fish appear before amphibians, then reptiles, then mammal like reptiles, then mammals. Dinosaurs appear before birds, land mammals appear before aquatic mammals, lemurs appear before humans. Every organism fits neatly into its era, exactly the way evolution says it would.

**Minor counter arguments:**

There were some basic counter arguments that I will address briefly. Most of these were pretty quick to refute, and were not considered complete explanations.

The dating methods are wrong: Even if the dating methods were wrong, why would the wrong dates still match up to evolution? Surely inaccurate dating methods would lead to a random fossil order.

The fossil order matches the days of genesis: No it doesn't. Genesis says trees came before all animals, and birds before land animals. This isn't what the fossil record shows us.

If an out of place fossil were found, evolutionists would just say everything evolved in a different order: Fossil order could be changed, but very sparingly. If we had to reorder the fossil record so, for example, humans lived alongside dinosaurs, it would look very bad for evolution. We would have to explain why there is a 65 million year gap in the fossil record and why all the hominid ancestors appear after humans. Thankfully such things have never been found.

**The main counter argument, the great flood:**

/u/4chantothemax seemed to settle on the great flood explaining the fossil record. According to conventional creationist flood geology, the great flood ordered the fossil record by the following mechanisms:

Speed: Fast animals could escape the floodwaters better, so the slower amphibians and arthropods were buried first.

Intelligence: Humans and mammals could figure out ways to escape the floodwaters better than reptiles, so they were buried last.

Flight: Birds could fly away from the floodwaters, that's why they're at the top.

Density: Arthropods sunk to the bottom because they're heavy, and light birds floated to the top.

Altitude: Animals bellow sea level were buried first, which is why the bottom of the fossil record is aquatic.

So in short, we would expect to see smart, fast, light land animals at the top of the fossil record, and slow, stupid, heavy aquatic animals at the bottom. But, as most of us already know, that's not how the fossil record is ordered.

First of all, it's based on a lot of unfounded assumptions. Though mammals and birds are smarter than reptiles, why would that intelligence help them escape floodwaters better? How could floodwaters be powerful enough to carry all that sediment, but slow enough to let animals escape? Why would being submerged in floodwaters first also mean getting buried first? Wouldn't the sediment only settle when the floodwaters have settled?

But even if we take all those assumptions as true, it still doesn't work. The fossil record is full of things that contradict the great flood's fossil ordering. Such as...

Slow animals higher than fast animals: Sloths and sauropods higher than velociraptors.

Stupid animals higher than smart animals: Mesozoic mammals lower than cenozoic reptiles.

Flying animals lower than non-flying: Pterosaurs and cretaceous birds lower than elephants.

Heavy animals higher than light animals: Heavy armoured ankylosaurs higher than buoyant ammonites.

Land animals lower than aquatic animals: Whales above all dinosaurs.

Some examples contradict every single one of them. Turtles are slow, heavy, aquatic reptiles, yet they appear at the top of the fossil record.

Not to mention it assumes that every single individual had the ability to escape the floodwaters. No individuals of the more recent species could be sick, injured, old, disabled, or dead.

**Conclusion**

In light of conforming to evolution's predictions, and the complete failure of any attempt to explain it without evolution, the fossil record is damn good evidence for evolution.",18,1498205480,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6izvca/why_the_fossil_record_is_evidence_for_evolution/

&gt; I've been officially accused by GuyInAChair of lying right here:

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6hw0y7/biological_information_and_intelligent_design_new/dj48li4/

&gt;I made the claim that there are more than 3000 entries in the Uniprot database for nylonases

Which is a lie. Or more accurately its a factually incorrect statement you continue to make after being corrected several times, which makes it a lie.

What you are doing is doing a name search in a database for a simple 6 carbon molecule, getting 3000+ results, and then equating those genes with the nylon digesting genes because they share similarities in nomenclature. They are not reacting with the same chemical! 

&gt;because nylonases don't actually digest a fully formed nylon but rather a waste products or intermediates of the nylon manufacturing process, namely **dimer** and **oligomer** 6-aminohexanoates

Bold mine. Because understanding these two terms are key to understanding where Sal goes wrong. For a more complex definition of the terms check out the wikie pages. Here is a [polymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer). Here is a [oligomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligomer) and here is a [dimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry))

On first glance it would seem that all three terms are explaining the roughly the same thing, and that's largely correct. The nylon-6 product that is digested by bacteria is in fact both a dimer, and a oligomer, and the nylon-6 oligomer is a nylon-6 polymer breakdown product. Confused? Well the important thing to remember is that they are all long chain macromolucules with a 6 carbon backbone.

Which is where the confusion comes in, because the 6 carbon backbone, or subunit is called [6-aminohexanoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminocaproic_acid) which is a really simple molecule, in fact its almost identical to the amino acid [Lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine)

This is important to remember 6-aminohexanoic acid by it's self **isn't** a dimer, or an oligomer. So lets look at Sal's next point.

&gt;So what does Nylb actually ""digest""? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-aminohexanoate-dimer_hydrolase

&gt;&gt;6-Aminohexanoic Acid Cyclic **Dimer** Hydrolase

Bold mine!!! Sal these are not the same chemical. This is freshman chem stuff here.

&gt;Ahem, so where again is the molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digested? The molecule GuyInAChair claims is being digest is:

&gt;https://biocyc.org/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=CPD-3923

&gt;Does the molecule GuyInAChair claims is digested by NylB the molecule that NylB actually digests in the papers that reported on NylB? 

I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Obviously yes.

The gene is named ""6-aminohexanoate-**dimer** hydrolase"" because it's a long chain carbon based macromolucule and 6-aminohexanoate is the subunit. 

&gt;So let's just settle this with facts rather than accusations of blatant lying on my part. If I made a mistake, I made a mistake, and I'd rather retract a mistake than mislead my fellow creationists.

It's an easy fact to show, it's right there in the damn name of the gene, and the chemical you copy pasted several times ""6-aminohexanoate-**dimer** hydrolase"" (there's also a cyclic version NylC?) This is simple stuff to understand with a freshman course in chemistry, and so simple that after a few beers I still feel qualified to explain it to you. 

The thing is I didn't start to call you a liar until you made this mistake serveral times, had it pointed out to you several times, and still continued to state the same incorrect thing asserted as though it was a fact. I conclude you knew this to be incorrect because you responded to the comments pointing this out, and since you made those comments knowing they were incorrect I'm calling you a liar.

&gt;False, A-NylB in Agromyces and NylB in Flavobacteria have 99% sequence similarity and they will come up in the search on 6-aminohexanoate hydrolases Uniprot.

Come on Sal. Those two bacteria are from the same damn waste water pond. They are literally touching each other. So I guess you caught me... I should have said there`s not a single other gene that has a similar sequence except one other... that lives in the same damn nylon-factory-tailing-pond. Com'on

&gt;So the enzyme doesn't digest nylon-6 but rather a waste product of its production. Yet I'm still accused of lying. GuyInAChair is welcome to offer a scientific counter to what I have presented.

You are lying. The waster water product is this [THIS](https://biocyc.org/compound?orgid=META&amp;id=CPD-3923) taken from [THIS](https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=P621-PWY) source. [THIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminocaproic_acid) is 6-aminohexanoic acid which is a subunit. 

Given the similarities in names this is certainly a forgivable mistake. Given you've been corrected on this mistake a half dozen times, and still hold to the incorrect claim dispite all the information needed to show it false having been available to you, makes you a liar.

&gt;There is no proof that giving a pig grapes will ever ever make it turn into a falcon. And you can't disprove it either. There is no proof that random mutations + natural selection in a lizard will ever ever result in it growing feathers and wings and becoming a bird.

Kent Hovind has to be one of my favorite creationists, in that he has become a parody himself. He's been out of the lime light of the creationist movement due to a ""tax problem"" which resulted in a 10 year prison sentence.

Personally I think he represents the old school creationists, who's only argument is ""you can't prove that so I might be right"" Unfortunately for him, internet usage has become ubiquitous during his time in the slammer, and people interested in the creation/evolution debate have had a decade to suss out his arguments while he was ~~in the slammer~~ locked up due to a scientific conspiracy. 

For those who don't have an hour+ of free time the debate goes as follows.

Kent: You can't prove that so... God.

Crocoduck: Yes I can, here's why.

""I arrive at my conclusion that there is no real evidence Evolution in large part by reading articles like this one. It uses deceptive semantics to mislead the reader about what the scientists actually created.

If you read and understand their description of the process, you see that their molecules are in fact *not* self-replicating. They are *self-assembling*, which is really a very different thing:

""Lincoln synthesized in the laboratory a large population of variants of the RNA enzyme that would be challenged to do the job, and carried out a test-tube evolution procedure to obtain those variants that were most adept at joining together pieces of RNA. [...] The replicating system actually involves two enzymes, each composed of two subunits and each functioning as a catalyst that assembles the other.""

So what you have here is *not* a molecule that makes copies of itself. When you have is four molecules which undergo a chain reaction that gradually combines all of them into two products.

It's cool chemistry that might have technological implications, but it is *not* a self-replicating molecule, and it is certainly not ""knocking on the door of life.""""

DebateEvolution,6gbxoc,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Dinosaur soft tissue - a nightmare for creationists,"As we all know, Mary Schweitzer has extracted collagen from dinosaur bone fossils.

The Tyrannosaur rex specimen MOR 1125 Schweitzer used for her research, was excavated from the Hell Creek formation, Montana, USA. The Hell Creek site has been very extensively and frequently been dated, [applying several different and distinct techniques](http://www.academia.edu/23452449/Magnetostratigraphy_and_geochronology_of_the_Hell_Creek_and_basal_Fort_Union_Formations_of_southwestern_North_Dakota_and_a_recalibration_of_the_age_of_the_Cretaceous-Tertiary_boundary). These measurements all yield concordant results. The particular strata where specimen MOR 1125 was found is also very near the K/Pg boundary. The K/Pg boundary is among the most frequent dated geological stratum, on very different locations worldwide.

Applying different and independent dating techniques simultaneously on the very same specimens and yield concordant ages, is called calibration. The odds of such concordant results occuring by random change is nihil, ***ESPECIALLY*** when one or more of those techniques were invalid, as creationists claim. This already works with two simultaneously applied techniques but the calibration validation will be ever stronger when combining 3, 4 or even more techniques.

When calibration yields concordant results, it's basically ""game over"".

There are very interesting results of the Schweitzer research that didn't catch the attention they deserve. These constiture a nightmare for creationists.

Evolution theory says that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The anatomy of extant birds already clearly relate them to reptiles rather than, for instance, to mammals, and the fossil record sufficiently demonstrates the dinosaur &gt; bird transition. 

But molecular evidence would be welcome.

Proteins are redundant. This means that the actual functional parts often only constitute a rather small proportion of the total molecule. Also the folding of the protein is of great importance, so any change of the protein that does not affect the folding or the functional part, do not matter. For instance, it has been shown that the human cytochrome c protein works in yeast (a unicellular organism) that has had its own native cytochrome c gene deleted, even though yeast cytochrome c differs from human cytochrome c over 40% of the protein. In fact, the cytochrome c genes from tuna (fish), pigeon (bird), horse (mammal), Drosophila fly (insect), and rat (mammal) all function in yeast that lack their own native yeast cytochrome c. Yet, cytochrome c is most essential for life. Removing it will cause instant cell death.

Consequently, proteins vary in their biochemical make-up among species. Closely related species show less differences in the biochemical make-up of their proteins than compared to more distant species. That makes them suitable for establishing phylogenetic relationships.

Collagen is no exception.

And since we have the collagen of Tyrannosaur specimens, we might as well use them to find out which species to be the closest relatives of Tyrannosaurs. This is called amino acid sequencing. Another, different approach is conducting antibody tests.

Schweitzer also found this to be an intriguing idea and compared the collagen she found in MOR 1125 with samples she retrieved from, respectively, newts (amphibian), frogs (amphibian), chickens (bird) and a mastodont (extinct, ~400,000 years old mammal). 

What is the prediction biology makes about the phylogeny of birds? That birds evolved from dinosaurs (more preciese: birds and dinosaurs form a clade).

And what did Schweitzer find? Of all collagen specimens she analysed, the ones from chickens resemble those of T. rex most. This was affirmed by antibody testing. Later research, applying amino acid sequencing in comparing protein specimens retrieved from hadrosaur fossils, also firmly confirmed dinosaurs to be most closely related to birds.

&amp;nbsp;

...then evolutionary theory would be falsified.

&amp;nbsp;

""But wait,"" you say, ""these are all absurd. Of course there's inheritance. Of course there's mutation."" 

To which I reply, exactly.

Every biological inquiry since the mid 1800s has been a test of evolutionary theory. If Mendel had shown there was no mechanism of inheritance, it's false. If Messelson and Stahl had shown there was no mechanism for copying DNA accurately, it's false. If we couldn't show that genes determine phenotypes, or that allele frequencies change over generations, or that the species composition of the planet has changed over time, it's false. 

Being *falsifiable* is not the same thing as being *falsified*. Evolutionary theory has passed every test. 

&amp;nbsp;

""But this is really weak evidence for evolutionary theory.""

I'd go even further and say none of this is necessarily evidence *for* evolutionary theory at all. These tests - the discovery of DNA replication, for example, just mean that we can't reject evolutionary theory on those grounds. That's it. Once you go down a list of reasons to reject a theory, and none of them check out, in total that's a good reason to think the theory is accurate. But each individual result on its own is just something we reject as a refutation. 

If you want evidence *for* evolution, we can talk about how this or that mechanism as been demonstrated and/or observed, and what specific features have evolved via those processes. But that's a different discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

""Evolutionary theory will just change to incorporate findings that contradict it.""

To some degree, yes. That's what science does. When part of an idea doesn't do a good job explaining or describing natural phenomena, you change it. So, for example, if we found fossils of truly multicellular prokaryotes dating from 2.8 billion years ago, that would be discordant with our present understanding of how and when different traits and types of life evolved, and we'd have to revise our conclusions in that regard. But it wouldn't mean evolution hasn't happened. 

On the other hand, if we discovered *many* fossil deposits from around the world, all dating to 2.8 billion years ago and containing chordates, flowering plants, arthropods, and fungi, we'd have to seriously reconsider how present biodiversity came to be.

So...evolutionary theory. Falsifiable? You bet your ass. False? No way in hell.

The user /u/Madmonk11 in /r/Creation writes his own [essay](https://houseofadesertvoice.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/the-remnant.pdf) about:

&gt; Linking Evolution and Humanity's Mass Delusion to God's Purpose and the Problem of Evil

Now let's look at the most important parts of the essay:


&gt; Now, in our world, we have been gaining more and more knowledge. Yet, we have not been informed by perfect omniscience, fully anyway, and in general, we are not compliant with what instructions we receive. The more knowledge we receive, we find ourselves continually with unknowns. We make assumptions. We rely on the assumptions of others. as a collective, we become comforted by our increasing repertoire of observations mixed with suppositions and theories, and our worldview becomes more and more solid.

So basically, yes we get it. Science builds on the discovery of others. But sure, the more scientists build on top of each other, the more..... assumptions we do? What's the implication here? Only a fool would spin this in a bad light. This person has 0% knowledge of how science works as we can see in the next paragraphs.


&gt; Yet, a certain rare few of us, those of us who actually are receiving input from God, are noticing that our evermore detailed worldview is just solidifying in its incorrectness.

Ah yes, the creationist, who is always just one button away from God's Skype calls (only him and a couple of others have his contact address), watches over the earth and all of the scientists doing work that is *just* incorrect. Brilliant.


&gt; Pretty much everyone will acknowledge the phenomenon in Nazi Germany. Achaeologists and anthropologists from Nazi europe scoured he world collecting evidence that white Europeans were descended from a nordic master race from the North Pole that has been in a forever war with the Jews, the root of all evil. The society as a whole became convinced of this, and it took losing a war to shake the view.

Holy trivialization. The nazi regime spawned a lot of unscientific research. That is true. The true reason for this was that the fascist regime relied more on politics and propaganda then on actual science. The whole notion that we could actually classify people into ""jewish"" or ""non-jewish"" or ""negroid"" etc. was completely unscientific from a modern-day perspective. There's not a single truth in it, genetically speaking. But the nazi regime, in control of pretty much every social outlet (news, faculties, books), practically *pushed* people into accepting this as a fact.

So basically, a fascist regime with almost complete control to information and education formed a whole generation of very very bad (and dangerous) science.

&gt; and it took losing a war to shake the view.

Yes, true. Fascism had to be bashed before people came to their senses again. Are you implying the same kind of obstructionist, totalitarian propaganda is going on today again? Let's see what the author says:



&gt; Likewise, scientists from all over look into various collections of fossils, molecules, genes, and whatever they can find to come up with the view that we evolved from animals, that our universe is a random accident, etc. The more we observe, the more we fit into this supposition, this collectively dreamed up, yet totally inaccurate and logically impossible scenario. At the end of days, humanity will never be more convinced of its view of itself, and humanity will never be more wrong. We are making the puzzle fit our preconceptions derived from limited knowledge.

Rambling. Not even an argument and a complete non-sequitur. I don't think I could find a better paragraph perfectly describing the word **whining** better than here. No arguments brought forward, other than ""wah wah scientists are coming to conclusions that are just *wrong* because the scientists are building up their science on what other scientists have researched"" because for some reason this individual does not seem to be able to word out why this is a wrong method.

&gt; this collectively dreamed up, yet totally inaccurate and logically impossible scenario.

Dreamed up? Seriously? Totally inaccurate? Any reasons why? Logically impossible? According to ignorant creationists like you? Where are your arguments. Oh wait, this is just an essay to jerk yourself off not to provide any reasonable insights.


Anyways, let's top this off with something even more ridiculous.

Climate change denial:



&gt;It’s actually ironic that I am writing this on the day that the US President has withdrawn from the Paris environmental agreement. The news is ablaze with scientists screaming about environmental catastrophe.

Haha silly experts am I right?

&gt; While there are many small theories contributing to the whole of the climate change movement, ultimately, the movement propounds the notion that the earth is heating up, that this will melt the world’s ice, and the earth will be flooded. The primary catastrophe that threatens the earth is global flooding.




&gt; **I can’t help but laugh with a wince.**

What the fuck kind of argument is that? LMAO silly scientists and their facts haha I sure have to laugh because I don't buy it.

Oh wait OP does seem to have an argument:


&gt; The bible predicts a great many ecological catastrophes in our future. Plagues the likes of which we have not yet seen are predicted. a huge amount of aquatic life is to be destroyed. The sky will be darkened. Stars will actually fall. Asteroids perhaps? Who knows. Trees burned, land scorched. It’s all there. Exxon Mobil will probably not be the cause of all this stuff. Biological weapons the likes of the various zombie apocalypse movies? Maybe? Yet, the bible tells us that
the world has already been flooded, and there isn’t going to be another flood. According to the bible, there is really only ONE ecological disaster that we don’t have to worry about, yet that one is precisely what the population of the earth is so convinced is going to happen, and so violently insists can only be averted with just the right corporate tax scheme.

Tl;DR: Climate change is not real because the bible already predicted the flood and only **one** flood. Therefore, a second ""flood"" will not happen. Therefore, climate change is not real.


So after reading the most ridiculous argument I have ever laid my eyes on, the smugness continues:

&gt; Only a very few people will realize that humanity just doesn’t have the knowledge to be right about everything without divine help. And only these same few will watch with their eyes open as all the scientists and politicians hold hands and pronounce statements about the nature of existence that are completely wrong. 

Again no arguments to be seen. Just OP tapping himself on the shoulder that everything those smart scientists and politicians say are completely wrong because they aren't in direct phone-contact to god.


&gt; They will be called deniers by a population that cannot comprehend that all the people who have been to our schools, who we call smart, could all be absolutely wrong.


Yes. People who go to school, study different subjects, get a degree in a relevant field, *could* all be absolutely wrong. What's the point? Ah yes I forgot, the point here is OP just knows better...... So where's the debunking of the denial part?

As if this wasn't enough shoulder patting, it just keeps on getting more ridiculous:


&gt; So here I am not talking about the faithful Remnant as those with discipline to stay the course, but that the faithful Remnant are those (same people) who see our flawed and finite race going off the tracks.

Again, something something we're just humans therefore I see over the world and all is flawed.


&gt; The more ‘knowledge’ our society amasses, the more this remnant will be called deniers of the patently obvious.

This guy's head could not be more up his own booty. Yes, the more we learn, the more it seems like we are diverting from the ""remnant"" a.k.a. that book written by goat herders is getting more and more inaccurate.

I can't even comprehend how any brain would think this sentence is okay. The more ""knowledge"" we ""gather"" the ""wronger"" we actually get. Yeah okay buddy. Not even wrong.



&amp;nbsp;


&gt; In the end, though, we will be the only ones who are correct.

""OP excitedly proceeds to stroke his penis.""



&gt;As every human leaves their mortal coil and meets the truth, they will be utterly shocked to learn that all of their scholars and academics and founts of knowledge were wrong about the very basics about where we came from and where we are.

""OP finishes at the thought that all of those millions of smart people were actually wrong and only he, the non-scholar, was right all along (because he says so)""




&gt; And this will demonstrate just one of the many things that God is trying to teach us with this fallen world: without him, we will fall into delusion, and the only way to avoid this is to believe what he tells us.

Anyways I got this response:

___

&gt; No self replicators exist between the complexity of a simple crystal-like structure and the simplest autotrophs with around 1 million base pair genomes, despite millions of viruses and other parasites existing along this range. Not a single one. If simpler self-replication were possible we should see them in vivo.

&gt; I'm not saying we should specifically see RNA-only replicators, but any replicators simpler than 1MB genome cells. There are RNA and DNA viruses with around 3KB genomes and they get along fine without being gobbled up by other cells.

&gt; I've seen others discuss minimum complexity as a problem:

&gt; * SETI researcher Paul Davies: ""The underlying problem is complexity. Even the simplest bacterium is, at the molecular level, staggeringly complex. Although we have no idea of the minimal complexity of a living organism, it is likely to be very high. It could be that some sort of complexifying principle operates in nature, serving to drive a chaotic mix of chemicals on a fast track to a primitive microbe. If so, no hint of such a principle has been found in laboratory experiments to re-create the basic building blocks of life.""


&gt; * Origin of life researcher Stuart Kauffman: ""Of all the problems with the hypothesis that life started as nude replicating RNA molecules, the one I find most insurmountable is the one most rarely talked about: all living things seem to have a minimal complexity below which it is impossible to go""

&gt; * Eugene Koonin: ""Given the intricacy of the molecular machinery of even the simplest cells, the lack of any observations on cell origin, except from other cells, and the lack of any apparent intermediate stages in the evolution of cells, the origin of cells engenders the ominous specter of irreducible complexity""


___

My questions to you are:

1. What do you think of the list itself?

2. How significant is this problem of minimum complexity?

3. What do you think of the 3 listed quotes?

3. What do you think of this statement (taken from above):

&gt; If simpler self-replication were possible we should see them in vivo.

My response was this:

&gt; Why should we? On earth, a lot of animals do not currently life on the whole spectrum of complexity. There are jumps everywhere because a lot of animals died out. We don't see any dinosaurs or mega-sharks today but they did exist and nobody is expecting that we ""should"" see them in vivo today. They simply died out, together with the RNA world and 99.99% of all life that ever lived on this planet which died out. Also, we ""shouldn't"" see self-replicators in real life nowadays because of obvious reasons. Apparently, RNA replicators can't survive in an oxygen-rich world which means any sign of them were destroyed as soon as autotrophes took over this beautiful world and secondly, self-replicating RNA is delicious food for any bacteria. I don't think any biologist would agree that we should expect to see them. RNA enzymes are a cool way to understand early life on a young earth, but those replicators aren't good survivors compared to todays animals. This is also why scientists have to make these RNA experiments in sterile environments to simulate early-earth (Early earth= zero bacteria or viruses that could harm RNA), whereas today's earth is not sterile in any way.

[2] If I made an old program with code that is similar to a newer program that has the same function, then I should be able to copy and paste the old code into the new program if the old code is well-written, so there is a similarity between both programs.

](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6dunoi/the_real_problem_with_convergence_evolution_news/)
Convergent evolution is when different organisms develop similar adaptations to similar environments or ecological niches. For example, sharks and dolphins have similar shaped bodies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Living in the same environment, selection favors the same general set of morphological adaptations. So you end up with different organisms that look similar. 

&amp;nbsp;

[In the linked piece](https://www.evolutionnews.org/2017/05/the-real-problem-with-convergence/) (from Discovery Institute, of course), the author claims that this is a problem for evolutionary theory for two reasons: It's unlikely (I'm going to ignore this, because *yawn* big scary numbers), and it violates ""the evolutionary pattern"" that more closely related species ""share similarities with each other much more consistently than with species on other branches"" that is followed ""with great precision.""

&amp;nbsp;

Except the author, Cornelius Hunter, applies this logic to *morphological* rather than genetic traits. And we do phylogenetics with genetics if at all possible, because it's more reliable than morphology. We've [experimentally verified](http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol445D_W00/exp_phylo.pdf) phylogenetic techniques *independent of morphology*. And we do have to account for convergence in these techniques, which we've gotten *really* good at. 

&amp;nbsp;

So this whole argument rests on misleading the reader about how biologists generate phylogenies. (Yes, there are obviously phylogenies that consider morphological data, mostly having to do with extinct species where genetics isn't an option, but this piece deals with extant organisms, so that excuse isn't available.)

&amp;nbsp;

The crux of the argument is that nylonase, the enzyme the degrades nylon, a synthetic fabric, didn't actually evolve, because it's a modified form of a preexisting enzyme. 

This older enzyme had some limited ability to interact with nylon, and this modified version of the enzyme just does it *better*. But it's not *new* new. It's just adapted from the old enzyme.

&amp;nbsp;

Really. That's the argument *against* the evolution of nylonase.

&amp;nbsp;

This is called exaptation: When you have a feature that does one thing, but it is co-opted to do a different thing. Happens all. the. time. It's a major source of evolutionary novelty. Saying ""This gene isn't new at all! It evolved from this other gene!"" doesn't undermine evolutionary theory; it's another datum in support of it.

&amp;nbsp;

The authors go on to make this claims:
&gt;The research underlines once again the very limited capacity of mutations and natural selection to create the complex features that characterize all living things

That's wrong. This shows that the evolution of novel traits isn't as hard as creationists think it is. This is one more study that shows how anytime you hear a ""it would take X mutations in Y amount of time, and that's just too improbable"" argument, think about how few changes are actually required for some major novel traits.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the post, in full:
&gt;Based on observed mtDNA mutation rates, mtEve dates to about 6000 years ago, contradicting the proposed timeline of the out-of-africa expansion. The 200ka date commonly cited comes from comparing human and chimp mitochondiral genomes, but this contradicts the observed rate and uses special pleading to assume a substitution rate 30 times slower than the mutation rate.

&amp;nbsp;

No. Here's how you figure out something like this.


&amp;nbsp;

First, you need to pick a region of the genome that accumulates substitutions (changes) at a relatively constant rate. This usually has to be a nonfunctional region - either intergenic (between genes) or a pseudogene (the nonfunctional remnants of a gene). This is important, because selection should not work to clear mutations in these regions, since such mutations should not affect fitness.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, what you care about is the *substitution* rate, **not** the *mutation* rate. The mutation rate is the rate at which changes occur. And change to the DNA is a mutation. Mutation rate is usually calculated as mutations/site/replication. The *substitution* rate is the rate at which mutations are fixed, meaning that everyone in the population has them, and is calculated as substitutions/site/year. Calculating the rate per year rather than per replication (i.e. per DNA copying) makes a big difference. 

So why do we use one but not the other?

&amp;nbsp;

It's really simple: Not all mutations get passed on to the next generation. Humans are multicellular. One of my skin cells could experience a mutation, but that mutation will never get passed on to my offspring. Only mutations that occur in germline tissue (cells that ultimately result in sperm or egg) *might* get passed on to offspring. The changes that get passed on and accumulate are substitutions, so we use that rate to determine the *time to most recent common ancestor* (TMRCA), the amount of time since two individuals/populations/species have diverged. 

&amp;nbsp;

The third step is to survey the genetic diversity of individuals, document the differences, and then using the substitution rate, work backwards to determine how long their lineages have been apart. And then do this again and again and again for lots of individuals to get a range of times. Very importantly, you have to do these calculations using the substitution rate, *not* the mutation rate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's an illustration of why this is important:

Say, for example, we have documented a mutation rate of 100 per generation, and a substitution rate of 2 per generation. (I'm just making up numbers and using the same units to keep it simple.) Now let's say we have two people, there are 1000 differences between them. If you used the mutation rate to calculate the TMRCA, you would say it would take **5 generations** to reach the 1000 differences (500 in one person, 500 in the other). But that assumes that every mutation that occurs gets passed on, which is completely unrealistic. In this example, it's only 2 per person that get passed on, so it would take at least **250 generations** to achieve the 1000 differences.

&amp;nbsp;

So when someone writes...
&gt;The 200ka date commonly cited...contradicts the observed rate and uses special pleading to assume a substitution rate 30 times slower than the mutation rate.

...they are completely wrong. You *must* use the substitution rate to do calculations like this, and it *is* slower than the mutation rate. There's no special pleading here. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm happy to go into this in more detail, but this error is sufficient to explain the different dates. Creationists are using the wrong metric to get a more recent date. It's that simple.

DebateEvolution,6cmlj9,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Why the fossil evidence in Darwin's time suffices greatly as evidence for evolution,"The number of excavated and studied fossils in Darwin's time is only an extremely small fraction of the ones we know of today. Yet, the fossil record familiar for early 19th century palaeontologists and biologists *greatly suffices* as evidence for evolution.

Darwin dedicated no less than two chapters of his *Origin of species* to the fossil record. In chapter IX he deals with the ""imperfection of the geological record"" and mentions the gaps in the fossil record, the Cambrian radiation event, the intermittence of geological formations and other problems and tries to explain or solve them.

In chapter X though he elaborates on the things that actually were known in his time. And this evidence greatly suffices as evidence for evolution of life. What exactly was the state of affairs in geology and paleontology when Darwin embarked on the Beagle for his famous voyage to all corners of the planet?

In 19th century geology the notion already started to take shape that the earth must be very old. This was derived from the observation that the geological record consists of thousands of distinct layers with greatly differing composition in an, at first sight, random order of appearance. And when layers are of different composition, you justly might infer that they are of different origin. That is, each layer formed in its own way.

How do we know? Well, if you find a layer which is littered with marine fossils, you might expect it to be a former sea floor. Layers where one finds land animals must have been terrestrial. Layers of charcoal are fossilized forrests. Challk rocks consist of trillions of fossilized coccolithophores and other plankton fossils and thus must have been formed in a relatively shallow sea. Etc.

When you find thousands of intermittent layers of all types cumulated on the very same spot (also refered to as the 'geological column'), where dozens of former sea floors (limestone, chalk layers, sandstone with marine fossils) are alternated by former forrests (coal layer), former desert planes, former terrestrial planes, all *on the very same spot*, you know a lot of time must have passed by.

But EVEN when we ONLY conclude that deeper layers are older than the ones on top of those and disregard any implication that all combined must span a large amount of time, EVEN THEN we must conclude about the following *observations*:

1. the biodiversity of each geological formation differs greatly from any other one

2. each geological formation has a unique biodiversity. Some genera may overlap several geological formations but in each formation there are genera and even families of species that are entirely unique for that formation

3. genera come and go. For instance: in Cambrian layers you won't find land plants, jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals. Instead you will find trilobites and a bunch of other, often almost alien life forms. In the Crateceous we do find land plants, jawed fish, amphibians, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals. But most of the extravagant Cambrian life forms like trilobites went extinct. If we look around today, dinosaurs are gone and the birds and mammals are very different from their Crateceous relatives.

In other words, even when we refrain from any claim of an old earth, or even leave the question about the age of the earth unanswered, we *still* observe that life GREATLY changed over the geological eras.

Consequently, Darwin didn't start his inquiries on biodiversity by asking *if* there's evolution but *why*. He tried to explain what mechanisms could account for *the observed change in biodiversity*.

The observed geological stratification and biodiversity found in the fossil record though DO DISCARD *DIRECTLY*:

- the simultaneous creation of all species ever lived, extinct or extant, on earth

- the notion of a world wide flood

- for that matter, a young earth.

The reason for this is simple: Allele loss during a bottleneck is *random*. There's nothing about a bottleneck that forces alleles to be lost. It's just *more likely* the smaller the population gets. 

So we have examples where we see little loss of allelic diversity, and we have examples with a very sharp decline in diversity. (You'll notice that Rana mentions none of these. Northern elephant seals are my pet example.)

&amp;nbsp;

The specific thing is a study of white-tailed deer in Finland that Rana claims invalidates a specific method of measuring genetic diversity as a valid way to calculate past population size. 

Except it doesn't seem like Rana read the paper in question. 

He says:
&gt;Though the researchers found that the genetic diversity of this population was lower than for a comparable population in Oklahoma (reflecting the genetic bottleneck that occurred when the original members of the population were relocated), it was still surprisingly high. Because of this unexpectedly high genetic diversity, size estimates for the initial population would be much greater than four individuals. To put it another way, this population size method fails validation—one more time.

&amp;nbsp;

Except the authors say this:
&gt;In terms of classic population
genetic theory (eq. 1), this high level of retention of heterozygosity in a population presumably founded by four individuals is unexpected. Nevertheless, our individual-based simulation of population establishment where the genealogy of the males and females in the population are tracked allowed calculation of a predicted heterozygosity which closely matches the observed heterozygosity in the current Finnish white-tailed deer population.
Because the introduced white-tailed deer population enjoyed rapid initial population growth, it spent a relatively short time period at a small size, which has allowed the retention of relatively much genetic diversity.

&amp;nbsp;

In other words, using techniques that accurately model real populations, you get an accurate answer, and in this specific case, we know why: rapid reproduction and rapid population growth. 

&amp;nbsp;

Deer reproduce a heck of a lot faster than humans (they reach sexual maturity within two years and have one to two offspring per year for eight to ten years). So not only does this study explicitly *not* invalidate the technique Rana claims it does, it actually exhibits how we can optimize these techniques as we learn more. In other words, how science is self-improving, allowing use to learn more over time.

Here's why it's nonsense:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“best fossil proof for theory of evolution”

It’s not “proof,” it’s just one more body of evidence

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Darwin thought…

Irrelevant

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;scientists in one place say one thing, scientists in another place say a different thing

Scientists disagree! Stop the presses. Happens all the time. Doesn’t call into question the underlying theory.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;scientists can’t agree on which land animal changed into a whale

No. Not everyone agrees on what that ancient animal *looked like*. There isn’t really much dispute that hippos are the closest living relatives (i.e. share a more recent common ancestor than any other land mammal) of whales. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ambulocetus…thought by some to be a walking whale

That’s what the name means. It’s named that because it’s a closer relative to extant whales than any extant species (it’s closer than hippos), so it’s on the whale lineage, but it had legs and feet – it walked. Hence “walking whale.” 

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Duane Gish: “I don’t know why they could call that creature a whale…”

Fuck that guy. 

&amp;nbsp;

No, really. I'm not going to pretend Gish is anything more than a dishonest hack who made a career out of lying. Fuck that guy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;ambulocetus might not be a direct ancestor!

Okay. Might be the case. Still represents something more adapted for water than hippos, and closer to extant whales than any living terrestrial mammal. 

Also, the rationale for this claim is the eyes high on the head, like alligators. You know what else has eyes high on the head? Hippos! It’s a useful trait if you live in shallow marshes or coastal regions! Less so once you live in deep water! Selection would favor this trait (i.e. individuals with “high eyes” would have higher fitness) during the transition, but not once they lived exclusively in open water. This. Isn’t. Hard. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;No fossils of rhodocetus tail, therefore how do we know it looked like a whale?

First response: We also don’t have fossils of Lucy’s feet, but we know what shape they were based on her hips and femur. 

Second response: Okay, pretend the tail doesn’t exist. It still has features that indicate it’s more whale-like than ambulocetus, and temporally it existed closer to extant whales than ambulocetus. Which all means that rhodocetus represents an intermediate species between terrestrial mammals and extant whales. 

There’s also a cut in the video at this point, during Gingrich’s answer to this question (at 5:57 in the video), so I don’t take the presentation in the video at face value. I suspect there is a “but…” prior to the second half of that sentence that go spliced together. He goes on to say “with that said…” as the audio fades out. So I’m not taking the presentation in the video at face value. Show the full tape.

&amp;nbsp;

Wait hang on. At 6:54, there’s a picture of the fossil progression, with question marks or or X’s over most of them. When did we start disputing that ambulocetus existed? Did I miss that part? No, we’re just going from “but the eyes are located differently from modern whales” to “isn’t part of this lineage at all in any way.” That doesn’t seem reasonable. And they got rid of basilosaurus with no explanation, at all. Hasn’t even been mentioned. Just cross that one off with a big red X for no stated reason.

But at least they kept dorudon, which on its own is sufficient to make the point about whale evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;changes due to accidental changes like mutations “are preposterous”

K. Except that’s how evolution works. The changes aren’t directed. They just happen. Lots of different mechanisms, but they’re all more or less “accidental.” You don't have to like it, but if you want to claim otherwise, we're going to need evidence of the mechanism that purposefully drives them.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, why do they keep bringing up hyenas? Nobody thinks whales came from something like hyenas. Some of the early members of the whale lineage (like *Indohyus*) may have *looked* like hyenas, but they aren’t very closely *related* to them. Again, hippos are the closest extant relatives. Whales are artiodactyls. Hyenas are in the cat branch of the carnivores. Did they have nobody on staff that could check this kind of stuff?

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt;For whales to evolve “too many body transitions would have to occur by chance.”

Asserted without evidence. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;nostrils would have to move to top of head and form a blowhole

No mention of the robust fossil record documenting this change. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Hair would have to disappear and be replaced by blubber. 

Hair is outside the skin, blubber is a layer of fat below skin. The are two different things. Whale actually have hair in utero. Are these filmmakers even trying?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Each new trait would require at least one new structural protein, which would require “at least 300 letters of DNA”

Asserted with out evidence. 

Also, 100 amino acids is a laughably small protein. Like, that’s a hormone, not a structural protein. Did nobody crack a biology textbook, or, like, peruse Wikipedia before writing this silliness? 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;dice analogy

Ignores selection, or presence of functional intermediates, or exaptation, or…

&amp;nbsp;

And…that’s it. That was a giant waste of time. There isn’t a single reasonable argument made in there, there is a TON of evidence omitted, and a bunch of statements that are completely false. Is this really the best the creationist-industrial complex can do?

First of all, /u/AlbanianDad miserably [fails to understand evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6banny/whale_evolution_vs_the_actual_fossil_evidence/dhmoz48/):

&gt; What I also don't get is that mutations are supposed to be random. When they pick an animal to evolve into a whale (like a hyena) they show it as though evolution had a ""direction"" from land to water. Or a will. Or a conscious of some sort. Like it was ""trying"" to evolve into a whale.

Well, mutations are indeed found to be random in respect to their effects on fitness. But, no, we don't try to show as though evolution had a ""direction"" from land to water. Instead, evolution is natural selection acting upon genetic variance, only that genetic variance is due to genetic mutations. So evolution is not a random process in the end.

Therefore:

&gt; ... why don't millions of animals across the globe grow dorsal fins randomly?

is *nonsense* because structures **DON'T** grow randomly.

&gt; Where are all the remnants of hyenas (or whatever animal) left in whales?

No, because hyenas were not the species that are thought to be the ancestors of cetaceans. Hyenas belong to the order of carnivora. Cetaceans belong to the order of artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.

And we don't talk about ""remnants"" but shared traits.

Here are the ""remnants"" of even-toed ungulates in cetaceans:

- breathing with lungs like all land animals do and not with gills like most sea critters do

- cetaceans are placental mammals, milk feeding their young ones and giving live birth

- their skeleton in about all respects is typically amniotic and synapsid-like, unlike fish, which are anamniotic

- early cetaceans like Dorudon and Basilosaurs had anatomically intact hind limbs, attached to a pelvis. Only those hind limbs were far to small (about a housecat's size) for such rather large and long animals (Dorudon up to 2 tons). Moreover, the pelvis in both species was not attached to their spines. You can't walk with hind feet that are detached from the spine. One may ask what marine animals were doing with anatomically intact hind limbs in the first place

- cetaceans have anatomic features that are only found in artiodactyls and nowhere else in any other animal (ankle bone structure).

A whole lot don't you think? And not even closely a complete list.

Then we have /u/ThisBWhoIsMe with the usual tattle about ""the hidden secrets"" of ""Darwiniast failure"" being ""caught"":

&gt; I liked the part where the Whale's Fluke turned out to be a fluke, Professor; ""I just speculated."" Also, the look on Doc's face, 5:38, when he got caught.

Maybe ThisBWhoIsMe could explain how an animal like [Dorudon](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDGwhales/PDGdorudonskel.jpg) could have propelled through the oceans???? With those tiny detached hind limbs? With its small front limbs? With only the long, lean tail its fossil remains are suggesting?

Now look at [the skeleton of modern sperm whale](https://readtiger.com/img/wkp/en/Sperm_whale_skeleton.jpg). See, no  fluke there as well. But about the same proportions of body volume to front limb size.

You know how modern sperm whale propel themselves: my means of fluke ondulation of the tail.

How do you think Dorudon propelled itself through the ocean water? I am wasting away your answer.

Right.

BTW, also observe the detached hind limbs in Dorudon ([in detail](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=imgres&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn1cTGuPnTAhXJ1hoKHeVPDnoQjRwIBw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Ftimevanson%2F7282107938&amp;psig=AFQjCNGggpA1o0QOTMXtT_hWiNGrYSVK4w&amp;ust=1495196875118079)) and the corresponding vestiges in sperm whales.

DebateEvolution,6btaly,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationist Question: What would drive selection for a new environment?,"This is something that comes up a lot, but rarely as clearly as in [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/6banny/whale_evolution_vs_the_actual_fossil_evidence/) of whale evolution:

&gt;but the question may become ""why does it select for living in the water instead of on land?"" It's certainly more likely that the animal the whale supposedly evolved from was already adapted for land just fine. I don't see why it would need this ""direction"" to evolve for the water. Chances are, as it's supposedly evolving into a whale, in the beginning it has some adaptations useful for water but still cannot live in water. Therefore they may be useless and actually provide a disadvantage for living on land.
Ideas?

&amp;nbsp;

Yes, we do have ideas. The very short answer is ""competition."" Too few resources in one place, so you start consuming them elsewhere, which drives selection for the new resources or environment.

&amp;nbsp;

The slightly longer answer is ""the competition-dispersal tradeoff,"" which is a dynamic where you can stay where you are and fight for resources (which carries a cost) or you can disperse to new resources (which also carries a cost). Selection favors the action that incurs the lower cost. High competition drives selection for dispersal. 

&amp;nbsp;

Read on for the long answer. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let's start with the basics: Resources are limited, so there is competition between individuals within populations. Unlike most of modern evolutionary theory, this observation goes back to Darwin himself. 

Because resources are limited, selection acts on those best adapted to survive and reproduce, and those beneficial traits increase in frequency. 

The question is, ""what drives selection for a new environment?""

&amp;nbsp;

The answer, as I said above, is competition, specifically a high level of competition in the ""old"" environment. When you have a population of, say, 100, in an area that can only support, say 50, those who are less well adapted for that environment will incur a very high cost to competing there - they will probably lose, which is to say die without reproducing. 

In such a situation, selection will favor dispersing to consume different resources rather than competing. This is not a conscious choice; some individuals will have alleles to consume only the ""old"" resources, so they compete, and they will lose. Others will have alleles that allow them to utilize slightly different resources. Just slightly. But they will encounter less competition, and so selection favors those alleles, which is to say they become more common generation after generation. 

&amp;nbsp;

Over many generations, the individuals that have dispersed away from the ""old"" environment may separate entirely from that population, and acquire morphological traits that allows that to consume completely different resources, or live in a completely different environment, from the parent population. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the specific case of whales, you have a population that lived on the edge of water. Some individuals were better at living and acquiring resources *within* the body of water, rather than competing for resources on its edge or on the nearby land. Nothing drastic, but some where better swimmers than others, for instance. Think Michael Phelps compared to your average human. Lung capacity, limb length, hand and foot size, etc. Relatively subtle differences that give a leg up in the different environment. For these individuals, selection favors ever more extreme versions of these traits that facilitate life in water - fins instead of legs, nostrils on top of the head, etc. 

Again, I want to make this very clear, there's no choices being made here. There is simply variation - some individuals better in the new environment, some worse. The better survive, and those traits - webbed fingers, for example - become more common. Over time, the mean phenotype shifts, and the extreme variants become more extreme. Eventually you get fins, loss of hind limbs, blowholes, etc. 

It's all down to competition driving directional selection for resource acquisition in a new environment. That's really it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, one may wonder, that sounds fine, but do we *really* know this is what happens? 

Yes, we do, because we can watch it happen. One example is apple maggot flies. 

&amp;nbsp;

Apple maggot flies can consume two food sources: apples and hawthorn berries. Hawthorn berries are the native food source, but a subspecies has emerged that feeds and live exclusively on apples. This change was driven by competition for hawthorn berries driving adaptation to a new food source - apples. The apple-feeding population have reproductive cycles timed differently, which has adapted to maximize food availability for larva. This is exactly the dynamic I described above, but it's taken place only over the last two hundred years or so. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, what drives adaptation for a new environment? A lower cost associated with dispersal than competition. Easy.",44,1495073001,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/6btaly/creationist_question_what_would_drive_selection/

To me, however, he seems to be guilty of equivocating.  ""Function"" has a specific meaning in Behe's analogy.
 
In Behe’s analogy, the mousetrap is part of a living being.  Its function is to catch mice.  Catching mice, therefore, is analogous to producing the effect of survival in the living being.  The ""completed"" mousetrap does this in a particular way,  but of course there are many ways to catch mice, just as our various organs produce the effect of survival in different ways.  My heart ""catches mice"" in a way that my lungs do not.   Thus, refuting Behe’s analogy involves demonstrating how a mousetrap can catch mice (i.e., produce the effect of survival) at each stage of its development, not how it could achieve any effect conceivable.  Tie clips do not catch mice; in Miller's scenario, therefore, the organism would not survive.

DebateEvolution,69f6nq,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.DebateEvolution,,A brief teleological defense of intelligent design...,"Here are a couple of criteria for identifying an intelligently designed thing.

1) It is assembled in a way that seems improbable (given our previous experience) as an effect of the operation of natural forces on such materials.

2) It seems to serve a specific function.

Biological life meets these criteria.

1) It is assembled in a way that seems improbable (given our previous experience) as an effect of the operation of natural forces on such materials.  

The regular operation of the forces of nature, in our experience, do not produce living things.  (Here I am confining myself to abiogenesis.  Evolution itself, as an unguided process, seems improbable to me as well, but I have already discussed that here recently.)

2) It seems to serve a specific function.

All of the systems and organs of living creatures exist for this purpose: to survive and reproduce. This makes biological life stand out among the regular effects of nature on physical objects, and it makes me think biological life is designed, just as the appearance of purpose in cars would make me (and I suspect everyone else) believe they were designed and not an effect of the regular operations of nature. And I would believe this even if I had only just learned about cars today and did not know the history of their making or who made them.

**Edit**:  In my original post I said biological creatures are unique in that they resist entropy by struggling to survive and reproduce. When we die, the genetic information that makes us who we are becomes disordered and lost and our ability to convert energy to work correlates directly with our being alive.  I therefore equated this struggle to survive with the struggle against entropy.  I still believe the struggle to survive is synonymous with resisting entropy in biological creatures.  Nevertheless, I have replaced the reference to entropy with the struggle ""to survive and reproduce"" because, if I am right (and the two are synonymous) this replacement doesn't matter anyway, but if I am wrong, it does.

I think there are at least three things to keep in mind if the whole issue is simply to distinguish designed from not designed in terms of biological life.

1) Imperfect designs are also the products of designers, so a design’s imperfections cannot rule it out as a created thing.

2) We may not be smart enough to judge the quality of the design in question.

3) What was once a perfect design may now be broken to some degree.

I realize that if number one is the case with biological life, that would rule out an omnipotent creator as the exclusive designer of biological life, but this is a secondary consideration.  All we are considering at the moment is whether or not the thing is designed.  One way to account for apparent imperfections might be to posit the existence of multiple designers: an original one (God) and subsequent imperfect ones.  For instance, a great many jokes could be made at the expense of a bulldog’s design flaws, but we know that this design is owing to the efforts of imperfect minds who have been given permission, for better or worse, to alter the design they first encountered.  There may be other designers than humans at work among living things.  

Anyone with even a modicum of humility should acknowledge the truth of number two. 

As for number three, when I consider the diverse, complex, and interrelated dance of living things on this planet, I am genuinely in awe.  It is sublime and breathtakingly beautiful.  At the same time it is tragic, filled with suffering and horror.  In other words, it seems to me like something that was once beautiful has been badly broken.

DebateEvolution,68y7bb,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationist Claim: Evolutionary theory requires gene duplication and mutation ""on a massive scale."" Yup! And here are some examples.","Tonight's creationist claim is unique in that it is actually correct! I'm going to quote the full post, because I want to preserve the context and also because I think the author does a really good job explaining the implications of these types of mutations. So here it is:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I believe you are saying the transition from this

&gt;I HAVE BIG WINGS.

&gt;to this (as a result of a copying error)

&gt;I HAVE BUG WINGS.

&gt;is an example of new information by random mutation. I see that this is new information, but it is also a loss of information. I wonder if she means something like this has never been observed:

&gt;I HAVE BIG WINGS.

&gt;to this (from duplication)

&gt;I HAVE BIG BIG WINGS.

&gt;to this

&gt;I HAVE BIG BUG WINGS.

&gt;This would amount to a net gain of information. It seems like something like this would have to happen on a massive scale for Darwinism to be true.

&amp;nbsp;

Yes! That *would* have to happen a lot for evolutionary theory to make sense. And it has! 

Genes that arise through duplications are called paralogous genes, or *paralogs*, and our genomes are full of 'em. 

&amp;nbsp;

Genes can be duplicated through a number of mechanisms. One common one is [unequal crossing over.](http://web.pdx.edu/~newmanl/UnequalXover.gif) Here is [a figure that shows how this can happen, and through subsequent mutations, lead to diversification.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Carrigan/publication/230616846/figure/fig4/AS:214095426002954@1428055735326/a-When-unequal-crossing-over-denoted-with-an-X-occurs-within-the-intergenic-region.png) 

&amp;nbsp;

But this isn't limited to single genes or small regions. You can have *genome* duplication, which is something we observe today in processes called [autopolyploidy](http://bio1151.nicerweb.com/Locked/media/ch24/24_10SymAutopolyploidy_3-L.jpg) and [allopolyploidy.](http://www.hammiverse.com/lectures/24/images/1-3.png) 

&amp;nbsp;

Here are a few examples:

&amp;nbsp;

Oxygen is carried in blood by proteins called globins, a family that includes the various types of myoglobin and hemoglobin. These all arose through a series of gene duplications from an ancestral globin, followed by subsequent mutations and selection. 

[Here's a general figure showing globin evolution.](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Globin_gene_evolution_2.gif)

[And here's more detail on the beta-globin family in different types of animals.](http://www.biologia.uniba.it/Darwin/04-occhio/occhio8.jpg) 

&amp;nbsp;

One of my favorite examples of the importance of gene duplication is the [evolution and diversification of opsins,](http://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/opsin_evolution2.jpg) the photosensitive proteins in animal eyes. These evolved from a transmembrane signaling protein called a G-protein coupled receptors. 

[Here's a much more detailed look,](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/364/1531/2819/F1.large.jpg) if you're interested. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I can't talk about gene duplication without mentioning HOX genes, which are responsible for the large-scale organization of animal body plants. HOX genes are arranged in clusters, and work from front to back within the clusters. [All animals have one, two, four, and in some cases maybe six clusters, which arose through gene and *genome* duplication.](https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/evoresources/Evolutionary%20medicine/evo%20devo%202016/macropic/hox%20genes.jpg) 

&amp;nbsp;

But how do we know that these genes actually share a common ancestor, rather than simply *appearing* to? [Because phylogenetic techniques have been evaluated experimentally, and they do a really good job showing the actual history of a lineage.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1736360) We've done the math. This type of analysis really does show relatedness, not just similarity. 

&amp;nbsp;

So yes, for evolution to work, we *do* needs lots of new information through gene duplication and subsequent divergence. And that's exactly what we see. I've given three examples that are particularly well documented, but these are far far from the only ones.

DebateEvolution,68pg99,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationist Claim: ""Biologists can't explain the evolution of introns/spliceosomes""","Who wants to learn about early eukaryotic evolution? That's today's topic, the claim being that biologists are unable to explain how the eukaryotic genome, containing introns and using a splicesome to excise them following transcription, could have evolved. 

Unsurprisingly, the assertion that we have no plausible mechanism for these evolution of spliceosomes and introns is not true. We actually have several plausible mechanisms, and there isn’t a firm consensus on which is correct. 

&amp;nbsp;

[Here’s the mechanism I think is the most probable.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626174)

It starts with a genetic element called group II introns. These are found in bacteria, and they are auto-catalytic, that is, self-splicing. They are also mobile genetic elements, meaning they can move around in the genome. Finally, they are often associated with proteins called maturases, which are encoded by these elements, and have reverse transcriptase ability. So group II introns are transcribed, cut themselves, and can be reinserted elsewhere in the genome. 

&amp;nbsp;


But these are *bacterial* elements, and we’re talking about eukaryotic introns and splicing, which brings us to endosymbiosis of an alpha proteobacterium. Such an event is responsible for mitochondria. One of the hallmarks of endosymbiosis is the transfer of genes from the endosymbionts to the nuclear genome. We can see this happening right now with *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

&amp;nbsp;

Why does this matter? A protein called Prp8 is a major component of splicesomes, [and it is probably homologous with the maturases of group II introns.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078730/) So during the endosymbiotic process that resulted in the mitochondria, the mobile genetic elements to create introns and excise them from transcripts were probably transferred to the nuclear genome. I say “probably” because that’s how scientists talk, but the we have a pretty darn good grasp of phylogenetics, having experimentally verified a number of techniques. So I say “probably,” but I mean “almost certainly.”

&amp;nbsp;

Has this mechanism been demonstrated? Again, probably. [In this study,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217561) two new introns were documented in yeast, as a result of a process very similar to what I just described above (utilizing extant cellular components rather than ancient bacterial ones). 

&amp;nbsp;

So, to review, you don’t need anything for RNA splicing except auto-catalytic ribozymes, which we have. To get introns, you also need cellular retrotranscribing enzymes, which we also have. Best of all, it’s most likely that we (eukaryotes) acquired both elements during the endosymbiosis of alpha-proteobacteria, which resulted in the mitochondria. Isn’t that nifty? A bunch of the characteristics of eukaryotic cells all coming together at once through a set of related processes during the same evolutionary event (primary endosymbiosis of alpha proteobacteria). 

It’s only unexplainable if you’ve never tried to explain it.

DebateEvolution,681xey,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Those pesky hind limbs,"Dorudon was a cetacean that lived in the Eocene. Beyond any doubt it was a marine animal, [you can tell this from its streamlined body shape](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2688267).

First of all, cetaceans are not fish but they belong to the mammals. We can tell from anatomy, DNA, physiology and behavior, like:

- they breath through lungs, not gills

- females produce milk to feed their newborns

- they belong to the placental animals 

- they give live birth

- the inner ear anatomy

- they are warm-blooded

- they propel through the water by up/down instead like fish left/right movement of the spine

- and some hundreds of other traits that link them to mammals.

Note: the traits above are mostly unique to mammals but there are some individual exceptions, for instance, live birth is also observed in other non-mammal species like some sharks but it is the total picture of hundreds of traits that make the point (and of course especially telling when sharing traits with mammals that are unique for those).

But the most telling trait that binds cetaceans to the mammals is their genetic make-up: of all animals living on earth, the one that resembles cetaceans genetically most by DNA comparison, is hippopotamus, an artiodactyl.  Not all too surprisingly, hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic animal.

There’s also anatomical evidence for cetaceans being artiodactyls:

- the double pulley joints anatomy of the ankle, a trait unique for artiodactyls

- a hooked knob pointing up towards the leg bones in the astralagus, unique for artiodactyls.

Dorudon is classified as a cetacean for a lot of anatomical reasons: 

- alignment of the upper incisors with the cheek teeth (typical for cetaceans)

- the nostril is not in the tip of the snout but has travelled to halfway its head

- the ear region is surrounded by a bony wall

- reduced pelvis and hind limb size (I come back to this!)

- structure of the tympanic bone

- the anatomy of the teeth

… and a few other traits that are unique for cetaceans.

Now we have established that cetaceans are mammals, belonging to the artiodactyls, we might pose the question why there are artiodactyls living n the oceans in the first place where their closest relatives all live on the land.

And those pesky hind limbs of Dorudon tells us why.

Dorudons and also another later, extinct cetacean, Basilosaur, have [fully developed hind limbs, attached to a pelvis]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Durodon_pelvis.jpg) and, [another specimen]( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7072/7282107938_e31856d35f_b.jpg) (both Dorudon atrox).

Those hind limbs were still fully developed according to basic amniote anatomy:

- femur including patella

- fibula and tibia

- tarsals and metatarsals

- digits

- neatly attached to a pelvis.

But perky those hind limbs were indeed:

- first of all, they were extremely small for such rather large animal (Dorudon was ~ 5 meters tall and weighted some 2 tons). The size of Dorudon’s hind limbs was about a modern housecat’s ones. I don’t think an animal that long and heavy could have walked with such small hind limbs

- but, moreover, the pelvis was detached from its spinal cord. You just can’t walk with hind limbs detached from the spinal cord

- also much of the ankle bones and carpals were fused as well, again making walking impossible.

Now the next, profound question here is: what was a *full-blown marine* animal doing with *fully developed, amniote type of* hind limbs which were *detached from the spinal cord* and *too small* for such a large animal and *whose ankle bones and carpals were fused*, making walking entirely impossible.

In other words, what was a fully marine animals, that used front flippers and a tail fluke for propelling, doing with hind limbs it couldn’t walk with?

If you want to engage, here are the rules when you want me to respond:

- if you want to rebut anything I wrote, only empirically founded arguments will be taken into consideration. Everything in my post is empirically founded so I expect your rebut to meet those requirements as well. Just ""It might well be that ..."", ""It could be that ...."" or any empirically unsubstantiated statement, like ""it used the hind limbs not to walk but to propel"" without any empirical evidence for it, will be discarded without further ado.

- Empirically founded means that you can point out to observations done by properly educatend experts on the matter. For instance, when you want to dispute the anatomical observations in my post, you must show me another observation done by a proper palaeontologist or anatomist.

1) Is anyone here honestly not surprised that this creature has retained the same essential form for 400 million years?  Given that random mutation and natural selection are constant factors, how do you account for the reality that a species has remained so static?  Evolution, by definition, implies change of some kind, at least over such a long period of time.  I suspect that, if it were not for the empirical evidence that has to be accounted for, no evolutionist would have predicted such a phenomenon.

They were presumably living in the same environment all that time.  In fact, as far as I can tell, an incredibly static environment is the only option open for evolution as a means of explaining its persistent body type (though this would still leave unexplained why other life forms in the same environment changed so drastically).

What's everyone's single favorite piece of evidence that refutes evolution? [That's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/65tg0q/what_is_your_single_favorite_piece_of_evidence/) on r/creation, and since it is specifically dealing with evolution rather than creation, I think it's appropriate here. I've picked out some of my favorite posts, so here they are and the response. I'd love to hear from the original posters.

Here we go...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Then we learn much more about how life works, and we realize that the slow rate of mutation is actually too slow to explain the complexity of life today. So either this planet has been supporting life for several orders of magnitude more than 6 billion years, or evolution is a slow process that occurs extremely rapidly.

&gt;We see some cases of ""rapid evolution"" today, but they all seem to center around either killing off all of a particular critter that couldn't adapt (without creating something new) or enhancing an existing capability (say, stronger forelegs on a lizard that is dealing with heightened competition). We don't really see cases where an eye develops from a light-sensitive patch of skin.

The old ""evolution is too slow"" argument. Only deals with single-base nucleotide substitutions. No gene duplications, no genome duplications, no hybridization, and ignores actual observed cases of rapid changes happening. For example, the extremely rapid speciation in Lake Victoria cichlids, or the acquisition of a primary plastid in *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Evolution, even by admission of evolutionists, doesn't explain how something lifeless becomes living all by itself.

&gt;Dead things stay dead. That is well known. Something living is needed to give life to what was not living.

&gt;This was proven by Pasteur, and that's why ""Pasteurized"" is on bottles of milk, not ""Darwinized"" or ""Haeckelized"".
So if a miracle created the first life, then it becomes possible to believe other miracles could have created various species. We can guess what species were created by studying the mechanical difficulty of evolving one creature to another.

Abiogenesis happened. We have lots of evidence. RNA world. Spontaneous assembly of RNA polymers and vesicles, spontaneous appearance of self-replication, all demonstrated in the lab. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I don't know exactly what Pasteur did to disprove abiogenesis, but it seems like we can hit this pretty easily today - jar up some peaches, ensure the seal is good, pasteurize the heck out of it, then let it sit for ten years. Sure, it will break down into goop, but it won't actually spawn anything either.

Was the early earth a closed system?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Ask them where the language of our DNA came from. As far as I know, it's universal across all organisms - certain genes code for particular proteins.

&gt;If they believe evolution, then the almost have to believe that an entire coding language was just conveniently built into nature waiting to inevitably rise from the muck and write itself a masterpiece.

Assumes the DNA --&gt; RNA --&gt; protein pathway appeared intact, which...nobody thinks that. Also, the universality of the genetic code is evidence of common ancestry. There's no inherent reason it has to be the way it is. 

And on top of that, we have a decent idea of why the code adapted the way it did. For example, check out the super-cool work on why we use cytosine in our DNA (Google ""Confounded cytosine!""). 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Nothing doesn't produce something and chaos doesn't produce order.

Really. This was in the ""what's your single favorite piece of evidence"" thread. Lots of elements + lots of energy. That's not ""nothing,"" and it's not chaotic. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Blood hounds smell better than any other dog, are they a different species?

Nope. But hybridized plants are. Or Lake Victoria cichlids. Or HIV. Or...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Simply put, the reason the DNA across so many species being so similar doesn't necessarily point to them sharing a common ancestor; since DNA is literally a biological programming language, one could argue that the reason the DNA is so similar (and even identical in certain areas) is because the code is good, much like how various computer programs will share certain portions of code.

DNA is not a computer code. It doesn't direct activity. Each gene contains the information for a sequence of amino acids. That's it. It doesn't tell them what to do, where to go, how to interact. It's just little bits of biochemical activity that interact, and the interactions yield emergent properties. 

And it's not even a *good* way to store information. It's just better than RNA. Example: The most common mutation in cytosine turns it into uracil, which changes a G-C base pair into A-T. That's dumb. Why would you design it that way? If you can make it work however you want, don't make it like that. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The other piece of evidence that I like, but it's really technical is the difficulty evolving a prokaryote (like bacteria) into a eukaryote (like a human).

&gt;I posted at r/debateevolution, they didn't even put a dent in the arguments!
https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/30c0fi/eukarya_could_not_have_evolved_from_bacteria/

&gt;I presented this to a Christian Darwinist who was a biology pre-med student, and in one hour he was converted to a creationist. The article is technical, it is a brutal read, but it's my favorited because of the level of scientific detail.
You can see for yourself, my detractors couldn't do much to refute the paper I cited written by Change Laura Tan who is a cellular biologist.

Because bacteria evolved directly into humans. And we've never observed something like endosymbiosis happening. Except that we're doing just that right now with *Paulinella chromatophora*. 

The arguments against this point when previously posted were quite good. If you take the most eukaryote-like archaean, and the most archaea-like eukaryote, they're pretty darn similar morphologically and biochemically. It really isn't that hard, unless you want to either lie or be ignorant. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Thanks to the 2nd law of thermodynamics...

Nope. 

Edit: Fine.

&gt;Thanks to the 2nd law of thermodynamics and the fact that mutations are almost entirely harmful to living creatures, successfully compiling the vast quantity of useful information we see in the genetic codes of the millions of life forms worldwide would take nothing short of a miracle.

Most mutations are neutral, we have many mechanisms through which information can increase, and have examples of each. See HIV-1 Vpu for a simple example, eye evolution for a more complex example. 

&amp;nbsp;

And...that's it. Those are r/creation's favorite pieces of evidence against evolution.

DebateEvolution,65pp3u,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,How did homochirality emerge? Like this.,"So over the last few weeks, we’ve been talking a lot about junk DNA. I invited a bunch of frequent posters on r/creation to weigh in. A few did, most didn’t, but one said this:

&gt; How about we debate the origins of chirality, instead? Why should we pander to discussing what he wishes, on an entirely different sub? I don't have the time to waste chasing down his pet example that no one has done the proper research to refute, yet.

Ask and ye shall receive. 

&amp;nbsp;

Chirality refers to the asymmetry of biological molecules – things like amino acids and nucleotides can be “right-handed” or “left-handed,” and biological systems only ever use one variant (L-amino acids, for example). 

Since a homochiral mixture will spontaneously become racemic over time, we need a mechanism through which homochirality could have appeared *before life began*. Creationists like to point to this problem as an insurmountable barrier for abiogenesis. Unsurprisingly, they are either ignorant of the work that has been done on this process, or dishonestly ignoring it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m going to keep this short, but here’s how homochirality could have appears in an abiotic environment.

&amp;nbsp;

One mechanism could have happened in space. Amino acids can form in space, and exposure to polarized light can lead to enantiomeric enrichment (EE), meaning that one variant is more common than the other. Here or [two](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2001ESASP.496..167M/0000167.000.html) [sources](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976459) on this mechanism. 

But how do you get from a relatively small EE to homochilarity? Autocatalysis! That’s when each variant promotes formation of more like it, and suppress formation of the opposite enantiomer, as demonstrated [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/16/5732.full.pdf). 

That mechanism can operate on earth or in space, but [here’s](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Ortiz16/publication/23421863_Evolution_of_Solid_Phase_Homochirality_for_a_Proteinogenic_Amino_Acid/links/09e4150caf2f1667a0000000/Evolution-of-Solid-Phase-Homochirality-for-a-Proteinogenic-Amino-Acid.pdf) another that’s earth-specific. Turns out physical disturbance can also lead to EE, which can then be followed by autocatalysis. 

&amp;nbsp;

But what about RNA? Turns out we have a mechanism for that as well. We know that RNA polymerization is catalyzed by the surface of various clay minerals. [Those same minerals can be stereoselective,](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11084-006-9022-9) preferentially associating with one enantiomer over the other. Once that happens – autocatalysis. 

&amp;nbsp;

So far from being an insurmountable problem for abiogenesis, we have multiple mechanisms for EE in abiotic systems. This simply isn’t the bogeyman creationists think it is. 

Want more? Here’s a [detailed review,](http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/2/5/a002147.full.pdf) and two [popular]( https://phys.org/news/2015-03-discovery-demystifies-life-chirality-phenomenon.html) [level](https://www.chemistryworld.com/feature/the-origin-of-homochirality/9073.article) articles. 

&amp;nbsp;

Your move, creationists. 

“But we’ve never observed abiogenesis!”

Yup. But the claim was there’s no way to generate homochirality abiotically. That claim is false. 

“But these aren’t *all* the amino acids/ribonucleotides!”

Yup. This work demonstrates the mechanism.

Oh man, new information, what ever oh ever do we do?!

Basically [this article](https://www.evolutionnews.org/2017/04/giant-virus-attacks-darwins-tree/) is a crock of ignorant excrement that amounts to ""biologists disagree about a new discovery, therefore evolution must be wrong."" Try to find an actual argument in there. Really. It's devoid of a point. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the deal. 

There are big viruses. BIG viruses. Bigger than some cells. With genomes that are bigger than some cells. Most of the ORFs in these genomes are of unknown function, but the ones that we do know have homologues in all three domains of cellular life - bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. 

This means there are two options here:

1. These viruses have infected a wide host range and acquired these genes via horizontal gene transfer.

2. These viruses share a common ancestor with the common ancestor of all cellular life. 

There is a third option that nobody really buys, but the DI states as now-discredited: that viruses represent an earlier, pre-cellular form of life (in other words, cells evolved from viruses). I don't know anyone who *really* buys that idea, but sure. Cells didn't evolve from viruses. Gotcha. Here's a participation trophy for that one, DI. 

So while the DI is setting up a strawman, real scientists are working out which of the two actual alternatives is more likely. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 1: Giant viruses acquired their genes via HGT.**

We know HGT between virus and host is a fairly common process, and some of the closest homologues to the genes in the viruses are found in their present hosts, or very similar organisms. The degree of similarity between some of the viral and host genes indicates the sequences haven't diverged that long ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Option 2: Giant viruses share a common ancestor with the common ancestor of all cellular life.**

Another way to state this is that these viruses are derived from very ancient cells. We know that viruses can evolve from cellular genetic elements. (My favorite example involves a plasmid stealing a capsid via HGT and becoming a virus.) [There has actually been a study hypothesizing this exact situation,](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015530&amp;type=printable) in which a common ancestor diverges into *four* domains, the fourth being the giant viruses (technically called the NCLDVs - nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses). 

&amp;nbsp;

The best part of all this is that these hypotheses are *not* mutually exclusive. This is only one relatively small group of (very large) viruses. Other viruses originated independently. My money is on the coevolution of a core NCLDV genome as a parasite of the LUCA population (option 2), followed by a TON of HGT over the next 4-ish billion years (option 1). 

&amp;nbsp;

But man, people disagree, so I don't know if evolutionary theory can weather the storm. 

Stupid DI. We get new information, we make interesting observations, we figure out what explains them. We have two possible explanations, both fitting squarely within evolutionary theory. This is how science works. Not that the idiots writing for DI would know. ",30,1491955445,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/64uqq0/the_dumbest_thing_you_will_read_today_giant_virus/

If one observes something resembling design, the most common sense, rational, and simplest explanation is design, not random chance. 

Even if you accept the historical evolutionary narrative, then the most rational explanation is that the mutations were guided by an intelligent agent.

There is no evidence the mutations are ""random"".

Besides, DNA proves intelligent design. Why? Because *information* has it's cause in intelligence. It's that simple. Analyzing the human genome and the *instructions* in DNA is no different than analyzing human written code and its functions.

&amp;nbsp;

Why is this here? Because I don't want to hear a word about the improbability of random mutation ever again. The probability stated above (~1.65x10^-8) assumes that everything has to happen *without selection, in a single generation*. But selection is a thing, and it negates any and all ""big scary numbers"" arguments against evolution. This little simulation gets at why.

DebateEvolution,63fd6u,nomenmeum,,t2_oogqj,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution's Problem with Probability...,"Arguments for common descent are strong when applied to creatures that interbreed with each other.  Two humans who share a broken gene are more likely to have that broken gene in common because they descended from a common human ancestor than because they developed the broken gene in themselves independently.  The arguments are not as strong when applied to creatures that do not interbreed.  Chimps and humans do not interbreed.  In order to claim that a broken gene common to chimps and humans is the result of common descent, one must first provide a probable explanation for how the ancestors of humans and chimps could have interbred in spite of the fact that they do not now interbreed.  Otherwise, one should look for other reasons to explain this shared broken gene than common descent.
  
In an earlier post, I proposed that such a gene might have broken independently among primates, but the general consensus on that thread was that, while this is possible and there are mechanisms to account for it, it is so improbable that I should not accept it as an explanation.

  
But what is the alternative?  To me, it certainly does not seem more probable that the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution has led to the increase of genetic information required to move from the first living cell to every modern form of life.  Any honest assessment of the variables involved in such a process must concede that they are unimaginable, if not incalculable.  To say that they dwarf those involved in the coincidental breaking of shared genes is a profound understatement.  As an example of just one tiny fiber in a thread of the massive tapestry of life, consider the probability of a land animal becoming a whale.  David Berlinski (Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University, a postdoctoral fellow in mathematics and molecular biology at Columbia University, author of works on systems analysis, differential topology, theoretical biology, analytic philosophy, and the philosophy of mathematics) puts this very starkly (beginning at around 11:00) in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ElA0--JNg) .   In [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9h-hmlMz5c&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL3E4krOqKtJtPtPKjBlPi8cIfprDXijKO) , William Lane Craig cites physicists John Barrow and Frank Tippler’s actual estimate of the probability of the evolution of the human genome by the mechanism of Neo-Darwinian evolution.  It is genuinely staggering.  And it only estimates the probability of human evolution.  What are the numbers incorporating every known life form? 
     
Why should we accept so improbable an explanation?  And if we do not have a probable explanation for common descent, why should we not look for other, less improbable, explanations for common features (i.e., common initial design, subsequent coincidental breaking of genes, etc.)?  Such explanations are not only less improbable by comparison but are in harmony with what we actually observe in things such as the inability of chimps and humans to interbreed.  Even Richard Dawkins, in [his debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwsuGiSzCkc&amp;t=402s) with Rowan Williams (around 6:20), concedes that living creatures “look overwhelmingly as though they have been designed.”  Indeed, “appearance of design” is a frequent expression among evolutionists, which is essentially an acknowledgement that design should be the default position, to be abandoned only when a more probable explanation appears.

Cordova","[Darwin’s Delusion vs. Death of the Fittest](http://www.uncommondescent.com/darwinism/darwins-delusion-vs-death-of-the-fittest/) by S. Cordova. Oh, wait. Could that be /u/stcordova? You're damn right it is! I'd page him, but I'm sure he'll be along shortly.

This ludicrous abomination was written by our creationist-in-safespace, back on June 2, 2013. Barrack Obama was fresh into his second term of president. I was getting stoned on my couch. And I didn't know /u/stcordova existed. It was a simpler time. 

So, what is the article about? It's about how clearly, inheritance of genetic material leads to accumulation of error. It cites a few scientific papers which are easily debunked. The majority of the opening is needlessly fluff, plus a boner-inspiring picture of a woman carrying eight fetuses, leading me to believe she's part-hamster. Unfortunately, this article doesn't appear to be about the risks of animal-human chimeras, nor was it penned by a Dr. Moreau, so I don't think we're going to discuss that.

The first scientific concept to be abused is [Mutational Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_meltdown), which suggests that in a small population, negative mutations can accumulate and lead to an extinction event if it occurs in a rather tight timespan, such that there is not enough time to select the mutations away -- this would only happen in an incredibly inbred population.

So, let's see how he abuses it:

&gt;How about humans? Were our ancestors more fit than we? Even though we are more technologically advanced than our ancestors were, we are more sickly.

...are we? He cites the following [intelligent design trash](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/is-human-intellect-degenerating/). I'll admit, their case is better than his: there are a lot more creationists around than I remember prior, but that might have something to do with the Internet. But it's also blatantly false, as we set new world records at the Olympics every four years and we have a positive IQ drift -- in most of the world, at least. So, I don't see it. At least he's consistently wrong, as we seem to be at an evolutionary pinnacle.

So, now we start looking into arguments about dropping features:

&gt;Let’s start with blind cave fish. Blind cave fish presumably evolved to be blind. Living in totally dark environments, functioning eyes became a metabolic liability. Hence, fish that lost their eyesight became more reproductively successful, even though they are functionally disabled.

...okay? Yes, this is how it works. If we lived around a dark star, you could bet that vision would be way, way down on the evolutionary ladder. It still takes many, many, many generations to see any effect and you have to apply that pressure to the whole population, not just small divisions. Otherwise, the movement of individuals and the mixture of genes will maintain a floor to the attribute and even prevent speciation.

&gt;Another example of “survival of the sickest” is sickle cell anemia where a defect in the blood enables African populations to better cope with malaria. Individuals suffering from sickle cell anemia would hardly view the condition as evidence of being “fit”.

You only have to survive to reproductive age, and pass on your genes, to be considered 'fit' enough. You could die the moment after you ejaculate, as long as you get the job done. It won't help your kids, but maybe she's a good woman.

&gt;But what about anti-biotic resistance and superbug bacteria? Superbugs are more reproductively successful, but in the overwhelming majority of cases, reproductive success was the result of dysfunction, not increase in integrated complexity.

Uh...okay. I know that's a lie. But let's note that, and see what he thinks supports it.

&gt;In his article, [Is Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics an Appropriate Example of Evolutionary Change?](https://www.trueorigin.org/bacteria01.php), Kevin Anderson lists 40 of the major cases of anti-biotic resistance, and *almost all were the result of broken pumps, bad expression of proteins*, etc.

Oh, great, he's citing another creationist website. This must be from before his scientific literate phase, when Salvatore was still puppeting Ray Comfort. Keep an eye on that italicized phrase, it's going to come back later.

Kevin Anderson appears to be a shitty scientist:

&gt;When rifampin is present, this mutation provides a decided advantage for survival compared with those cells lacking these specific mutations.  But, each of these mutations eliminates binding affinity of RNA polymerase for the rifampin.  As such, these mutations do not provide a mechanism accounting for the origin of that binding affinity, only its loss.

Okay? How would acquiring resistance to an anti-biotic by mutating a gene EVER provide a mechanism for the origin of said gene? It's further down the timeline, by its nature it can't explain that. You might as well ask when my wife is going to give birth to my grandmother -- it doesn't work that way, and not just because I'm not married.

Mr. Anderson seems to think that a short-term loss of functionality is demonstration that functionality could never be restored. He ignores that the mutation can be unwritten once the bacteria is capable of surviving in the environment. He also ignores that specialization always has a cost.

&gt;Mutations that reduce or eliminate the repression control of MarR result in over-production of the MarAB efflux pump, which enables the cell to expel higher concentrations of antibiotics or other antibacterial agents (Oethinger et al., 1998; Poole, 2000; Zarantonelli et al., 1999).

Remember those italics? Yeah. This is where the functioning pump is.

&gt;However, a mutation that causes loss of regulatory control (in this case the repressor protein, MarR) does not offer a genetic mechanism that can account for the origin of this regulatory control.

And yet again, he's looking for origins from a mutation.

Let's move back, because what's coming next is a ton of fun and how this article got its subtitle. And it's incredibly wrong. I could have just gone to this, but I felt like tearing up his entire work first to really nail down how empty his theory is.

&gt;[The following video is a crude 1-minute silent animation that I and others put together.](https://youtu.be/SrIDjvpx7w4) God willing, there will be major improvements to the animation (including audio), but this is a start. Be sure to watch it in full screen mode to see the details.

&gt;The animation asserts that if harmful mutation rates are high enough, then there exists no form or mechanism of selection which can arrest genetic deterioration. Even if the harmful mutations do not reach population fixation, they can still damage the collective genome.

&gt;The animation starts off with healthy gingerbread parents. Each parent spawns 2 gingerbread kids, and the red dots on the kids represent them having a mutation. To simplify the animation, the reproduction was depicted as asexual, but the concept can easily be extended to sexually reproducing species.

&gt;The missing gingerbread limbs are suggestive of severe mutations, the more mild mutations are represented by gingerbread kids merely having a red dot and not having severe phenotypic effects of their mutation. The exploding gingerbread kids represent natural selection removing the less functionally fit from the population. 4 generations are represented, and the fourth generation has three mutations per individual.

Simple form: negative mutations are passed on. Therefore, mutations will keep accumulating, until the population dies! THEREFORE, EVOLUTION IS A LIE! A FUCKING LIE! Sure. If you're an idiot.

Among the bacterium, this logic is true. But amongst bacteria, they produce huge populations. They double every 20 minutes regularly, compared to humans which might double every 3 or 4 generations optimistically [50-70 years]. The negative mutations aren't a concern, because those that get them die quickly, and those that don't take their place.

But in humans, we got a better strategy: I got a dick and balls. It's mostly about those balls though: did you know the average ejaculation has between 200 and 500 million individual sperms? You know what's the most interesting thing about my sperms? They only have half my genome.

Why does that matter? Well, I have two copies of every gene. If I pick up a bad one, hopefully the second is okay. But if my sperm gets a bad one, he's a dead sperm. He's not making it to the egg -- [he's one of these badboys](http://www.conceiveeasy.com/uploads/treating-abnormal-sperm.png). Sperm isn't as complex as a person, so this genetic beta test isn't perfect -- but it's enough that most serious errors get caught long before there's an individual.

That's 200m to 500m potential people. And only one of them, the most perfect one [in theory] gets through. Unfortunately, the egg doesn't have quite the same mechanism -- I recall egg-genesis splits into 4 germ cells, of which only one is selected to be an egg and the others shut down.

So, what does he close this shitty video with?

&gt;Note the persistence of bad mutations despite any conceivable mechanism of selection. 

Yes. No *conceivable* mechanism. *Conceivable*. As in *conception*. Penis-in-vagina. Am I dumbing this down enough?

IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT BABY BATTER!

It seems to me that there are two possibilities:

1) The mutation is a brute fact of reality; it has no cause.

2) The mutation has an unknown cause (or causes), hence its unpredictability.

Possibility number one cannot be right because this would amount to an argument from ignorance.  We would be moving from the premise “I don’t know the cause of mutation X” to the conclusion, “Therefore, mutation X has no cause,” and this would never be rationally justified.  

That leaves possibility number two, but this option concedes that the mutation is an effect of particular (as yet unknown) conditions on particular individuals. 
  
To me, this makes plausible the idea that those mutations we share with chimps appeared independently in human and chimp genomes.  True, the probability that the mutation occurred in one individual (an ancestor common to both chimps and humans) rather than in two (the ancestor common to all humans and the ancestor common to all chimps) is greater, but in the overall scheme of things, this difference does not seem very significant to me, especially once one concedes that the mutation is a result of particular (though unknown) causes which are likely to affect individuals with comparable genetic structures in the same way.

I know this thread won’t accomplish that, but the point here is to briefly (well, sort of…) run through the argument that irreducible complexity is a refutation of evolutionary theory and all of the different ways it fails. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, we have to define irreducible complexity (IC). The “modern” version of this concept comes from biochemist Michael Behe, who articulated the idea in his 1996 book  “Darwin’s Black Box.”

Here’s how Behe defines/explains irreducible complexity:

&gt; By irreducibly complex, I mean a single system which is necessarily composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly, that is by continuously improving the initial function which continues to work the same mechanisms by slight successive modifications of a pre-cursor system, because any pre-cursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is, by definition, non-functional.

&gt; An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually, it would have to arise as an integrated unit in one fell swoop for natural selection to have anything to act on.

&amp;nbsp;

There are a few different ways to interpret this concept. One can read it as simply defining IC, without drawing larger conclusions for the validity of evolutionary theory, or one can read it as drawing from IC the conclusion that evolutionary theory is largely invalid. I favor the latter interpretation, because of this line:

&gt; An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution.

This indicates that Behe *is* using IC to draw conclusions regarding the validity of evolutionary theory. That’s the whole point; IC is supposed to refute evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

We can further interpret this idea in two ways. Based on the above articulation, it seems to me that Behe is excluding a number of evolutionary process from consideration when it comes to the origin of IC systems. 

Specifically:

&gt;cannot be produced directly, that is by continuously improving the initial function...

Assumes constant selective pressure (i.e. a constant fitness landscape – no variation in what is adaptive or deleterious over time), and also excludes useful intermediate states.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;...the initial function which continues to work the same mechanisms...

Excludes exaptation, the co-opting of structures that do one thing to do something else. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;...by slight successive modifications of a pre-cursor system...

Excludes all mutations except single-base substitutions.

&amp;nbsp;

All of these excluded processes are mechanisms of evolutionary change. To simply exclude them from consideration when trying to evaluate the “evolvability” of a system is completely invalid. If this is in fact how Behe intends to use the concept of IC, which I believe it is based on his own definition, then the hypothesis “IC systems cannot evolve” is not even wrong. Identifying a system as IC has no bearing on its evolvability if that characterization excludes most evolutionary mechanisms. 

So, **Option 1: Irreducible complexity cannot address whether complex systems can evolve.**

This is how I interpret Behe’s argument, as articulated above, so personally, this is why it fails.  

&amp;nbsp;

But let’s say I’m wrong, and IC *doesn’t* exclude all of those processes. Let’s say all evolutionary processes are fair game. Again, I don’t think this is the correct way to interpret the above argument, but let’s just say. 

If this is the case, IC is at least theoretically applicable to the question of evolvability, and under this interpretation, there are two further ways to interpret Behe’s argument.

&amp;nbsp; 

First, he could mean that *no* systems identified as IC could evolve; if a system that meets the conditions for IC exists, it could not have evolved, period. This is demonstrably false. Two simple counterexamples are HIV-1 Vpu and the Cit+ line in the Lenski LTEE. I want make clear: These are not systems thought to be irreducible that have been shown to actually not be. These are examples that adhere to Behe's definition, but that we have *documented* evolving. Which means, if the hypothesis is “systems identified as IC cannot evolve,” then that hypothesis is false. 

**Option 2: Irreducible complexity fails as a refutation of evolutionary theory.**

&amp;nbsp;

Or, Behe could simply be arguing that *some* IC systems cannot evolve. Some can, some can’t. Which means that the above examples don’t falsify the hypothesis. In fact, no counterexamples would, because this formulation leaves open the possibility that there is always the *chance* that we *might* find some system that cannot have evolved. And even then, it would still have to be *demonstrated* that such a system cannot have evolved. This is not falsifiable. It is a classic designer-of-the-gaps argument.

**Option 3: Irreducible complexity, as a refutation of evolutionary theory, is not falsifiable.**

&amp;nbsp;

And those are the three ways to interpret the hypothesis that identifying a system as irreducibly complex precludes the evolution of that system. Each interpretation necessarily leads to a different outcome. The hypothesis is either inadequate to address the question, false, or unfalsifiable. [Here's a flowchart.](http://imgur.com/hkcHiql)

DebateEvolution,61625n,stcordova,,t2_79d54,self.DebateEvolution,,DarwinZDF42 can't explain evolution of homochirality in proteins,"I claim DarwinZDF42, the resident PhD in Genetics and microbiology and professor of evolutionary biology can't give a credible explanation of the evolution of homochirality in linear polypeptids called proteins from a primordial environment.

The infamous Urey-Miller experiment and those like it created heterochiral racemic mixtures of amino acids.  Even if, because of some asymmetry properties in physics or homochiral amplification happened briefly, it won't last long (relative to geological time) because the Gibbs free energy favors  spontaneous formation of racemic rather than homochiral pools of amino acids, not to mention the polymerization step if done through high heat (such as in Sidney Fox's proto proteins) destroys homochirality.

There have been a few claimed experiments to solve the homochirality problem, but they involved things other than amino acids many times, and the few times they did involve amino acids, they were not heterogenous mixes of amino acids and the amplification process involved ridiculous wetting and drying cycles in non realistic conditions.  And they would become racemic anyway after they laid around a while.  The Gibbs free energy favors formation of racemic rather homochiral soups over time.  One can't fight basic physics and chemistry.  That is the natural and ordinary direction of chemical evolution.

Furthermore, in water, the Gibbs free energy favors spontaneous hydrolysis reactions, not the requisite condensation reactions.  The only desperate solution is to have the poor amino acids sit on a shore where they can dry a little bit during the day in low tide to undergo condensation reactions. But then, they won't likely be alpha-peptide bonds (like in real life) but other kinds of bonds, and they might likely not form  linear polymers.  Oh well.

And after all that, the poor proto-protein will have to fall back into that warm little pond to form life before the spontaneous hydrolysis reactions blow it apart again.

But beyond all that, the sequence of the amino acids has to be reasonably right (more improbability), and we need lots of proteins simultaneously in the right context along with energy sources like ATP to get things going.  Hard to have ATP without proteins.  That is the chicken and egg problem, so to speak.

So why the need for homochirality?  Look at the Ramachandran plot of amino acids:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramachandran_plot

If there is a mix of chirality, then there will be a mix of natural ""turning"" ability of amino acids in a peptide chain.  The result of such a mix is the inability to form necessary protein secondary structures like the alpha helix:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix

With the exception of the one residue that isn't chiral (glycine) this would mean a set of functional peptides with 500 chiral residues would have to be all left (or all right) to create such secondary structures necessary for function.  The probability of this happening by chance is:

2^500 ~= 3.2 x 10^150

DarwinZDF42 could try to address these points, but I expect a literature bluff and noise making, not a real response.    Would that be a responsible thing to do for his students?  Well, if he wants to really give them counters to creationist arguments he better do a lot more than give non-answers like he did in the last round where he pretty much failed to show up except to say:

Now me, I'm just a trouble maker with of no reputation and a high school diploma.  If I'm as dumb as his associates say I am, he should be able to easily refute me.

From wiki:
&gt;Topoisomerases are enzymes that participate in the overwinding or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this torsion would eventually stop the ability of DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand.

&gt;In order to prevent and correct these types of topological problems caused by the double helix, topoisomerases bind to double-stranded DNA and cut the phosphate backbone of either one or both the DNA strands. This intermediate break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed again. Since the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not change, the tangled and untangled DNAs are chemical isomers, differing only in their global topology, thus the name for these enzymes. Topoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of DNA.[1]

&gt;Bacterial topoisomerase and human topoisomerase proceed via the same mechanism for replication and transcription.

Here is a video showing what topoisomerase has to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fbPUGKurI

Now, since topoisomerase is so important to DNA replication and transcription, how did topoisomerase evolve since the creature would likely be dead without it, and if the creature is dead, how will it evolve.

No hand waving, no phylogenetic obfuscationalism that doesn't give mechanical details.

&gt;inclusive fitness as the key concept that was omitted. By doing that, you are emphasizing natural selection over drift and that just adds to the original misconception. Inclusive fitness is a insignificant factor in evolution in 90% of all species because individuals don't even know who their relative are. (Think bacteria and protozoa.) In the rest, mostly animals, inclusive fitness only accounts for fixation of a small percentage of the alleles that are fixed by natural selection. Furthermore, alleles fixed by selection are only a fraction of those fixed by random genetic drift. 

&gt;I'm afraid that Sally Le Page has missed the real problem in the original video and only made the misconception worse by bringing up inclusive fitness. 

&gt;The last point (#6) is complicated. Charlie_McDonnell said in the video that we share 50% of our DNA with bananas. This is clearly incorrect. I don't know what the exact number might be but let's do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Let's say that bananas and humans have 10,000 orthologous protein-coding genes and let's say the coding regions are 50% identical in amino acid sequences. That would account for less than 0.5% of the genomes. Adding in a bit of other genes and functional sequences won't get us over 1%. The rest is mostly junk DNA and it's unlikely there is any significant sequence similarity. We certainly don't share 50% of our DNA with bananas.

You can either have a mutation rate so high that the bad stuff builds up so fast that the good stuff and selection can't keep up (but there are a large number of adaptive mutations occurring as well), OR you have very slow accumulation of adaptive mutations, which implies a low overall mutation rate, which means no genomic entropy.

One question would lead to another, and I was just constantly trying to learn more about it. When my parents learned of this, naturally, they were very disturbed. At first, things were very tense between us, but they (especially my dad) have started to open up more. We've had some very deep conversations about religion and life and when I bring up evolution, I can tell he's really listening to me.

**New Protein's Without God's Help**

&gt;""We've been trying to explain all this to the protein ""experts"" at ICR for the last seven years. We have told them that new proteins could indeed form from the random ordering of amino acids. We have warned them that their calculations were based on faulty assumptions and soon someone would document **the natural formation of a new protein from the random association of amino acids.**

&gt;Now it has happened! Not one, but two, new proteins have been discovered. In all probability **new proteins are forming by this process all the time, but this seems to be the first documentation of this phenomenon.** The newly discovered proteins are enzymes that break down some of the byproducts produced during nylon manufacture. **Since nylon first came into commercial production in 1940, we know that the new enzymes have formed since that time.**""


I took the original papers going back to the 1975 researchers and manually entered some of the sequences into the NIH BLAST programs.

I haven't looked at NylA yet, but a little BLASTing at the NIH NCBI gene banks gave me some interesting discovery.  It turns out other bacteria have highly similar genes already that eat nylon.    When the NCSE put out this essay, it was before people figured out a functional version of the gene was already in existence.

Here is the Accession number for the NylB gene in Flavobacteria:
WP_012476894.1 

Tell me if you get a similarity hit elsewhere using NIH approved tools like this one:
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

Hmm, I got a hit with that registered as this accession number of Agromyces: BAE97621.1 with 100% coverage and 99% identity!  Whoa!  The gene already existed, maybe for million of years (if you believe in Old Earth).  It might not bee that new.

Get that!  The ""new"" gene in Flavobacteria that the NCSE was crowing about already existed in Agromyces, but when the NCSE put out it's essay in 1985, the Argromyces genes had not been sequenced and published yet (which happened in 2007).  So the NCSE was making an argument based on ignorance.


I also got a lot of similarity to WP_012476894.1 ( 6-aminohexanoate hydrolase) in other bacteria, suggesting the basic proteins and genes existed elsewhere than what the NCSE article insinuates.

This paper on Agromyces points out Agromyces also can degrade nylon, so the Flavobacterium that Darwinists have be crowing about didn't really have that novel a gene, it existed in other bacteria, so by definition it isn't novel:

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172308700148

One alternative is to argue 392 amino acid residues (or about 1200 nucleotides) simultaneously evolved in to different bacteria since 1935 from a random sequence.  But Darwinists surely can't believe that.

One can invoke horizontal gene transfer, but that is still problematic since the pOAD2 plasmid on flavobacteria that enabled nylon degradation could just as well come from a pre-existing gene on another bacteria, so this doesn't solve anything.


Or did that sequence pre-exist in both those bacteria (minus a tweak here or there)?  If they pre-existed, it's hard to say they weren't already expressed genes.  For all we know the Agromyces nylon eating gene could already eat Nylon.  But if it evolved, how many  nucleotide changes do Darwinists think was involved from the ancestral gene?   

Now some of Darwinsits need some biochemistry understanding.   Suppose an enzyme that degrades one substance gets tweeked to degrade nylon, it probably means the enzyme loses specificity for another substance it might have been used for before.  So to gain catalytic function in one dimension, it likely has to lose it in another.  That's how enzymes are.  Or were you Darwinists naïve enough to think acquisition of a new catalytic function by and existing gene implied the new function did not come at the price of destroying pre-existing function?  

So if one has to blow apart something that's working to make something else work, that's not good for evolving more complexity that involves new enzymes in addition to pre-existing ones.  Don't Darwinists realize there is an accounting problem here?

&gt;did bacteria really evolve a new gene to eat Nylon?

It could just as well be said Darwinian process destroyed a pre-existing function in order to create a different one.

For example, one thing that *always* comes up is that we have the Word of God, and therefore we should accept creation. But, that takes faith, etc, and then it can bog down. 

Instead of pointing out the fallacy, go for ""okay, why should I accept the Bible as divinely inspired?""

Well, it contains verifiable truths about the world that the authors could not have known, and therefore we know it's divinely inspired.

Okay, great, what are these truths, and how can we verify them? Now we're back talking about hard evidence instead of tit-for-tat-ing about faith and close-mindedness.

DebateEvolution,5v1usq,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,More Fun with Nathaniel Jeanson,"Jeanson (who we met previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5t8895/scientist_claiming_evolutions_mutation_rates_dont/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ttv3g/creationist_scientist_dr_nathaniels_jeansons/)) sure writes a lot, but none of it is peer reviewed, and none of it makes any sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

Let’s take a look at some of this other work. I like this one: The section titled “Irreducible Complexity” from [Three Puzzles Evolution Can’t Solve.]( https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-against-evolution/three-puzzles-evolution-cant-solve/)

&amp;nbsp;

I’m just going to go through it top to bottom with my thoughts. Let’s see how Jeanson does, shall we?

&amp;nbsp;

Right of the bat, quote mine. Great start. 

&amp;nbsp;

First section if “Irreducibly Complex Cells,” in which Jeanson waxes on how complicated the DNA ➔ RNA ➔ Protein pathway is, and how it couldn’t have evolved. There’s even a little inset called “all or nothing.”

I wonder if he’s heard of ribozymes?

&amp;nbsp;

The next section is about four ways evilutionists try to explain things.

First is artificial selection, which he brushes aside as invalid because it’s not *natural selection*. Nevermind that the mechanism is the same.

Then comes a bit on “evolutionary scaffolds,” which I take to mean simpler structures intermediate to modern cells. Fine such as it is, but he then takes the term literally and says well bridges need designers, so evolutionary theory fails. No discussion of the idea of, for example, protocells on its merits. 

Third is…phylogenetics? He doesn’t use the word, but that’s what he describes. Except, nobody uses phylogenetics as evidence *for* evolution. Like, if you said to me, ""give me the single best argument for evolution!"" I'd probably talk about the eye. Then maybe I'd explain how we can use phylogenies to show the relationships. It’s a way to determine and organize evolutionary relationships. I don’t know what this guy thinks phylogenetics is, but he’s wrong. 

Then neutral evolution, which he claims is a synonym for “luck.” And the counterargument, of course, is that it’s too improbable. 

Except that it isn’t, and neutral mechanisms (which are not the same thing as random mechanisms, which someone claiming to be an expert should know) aren’t the only things going on. It’s not selection *or* random mutation *or* drift, it’s all of them together, at the same time. 

&amp;nbsp;

The next section…oh. That’s it. That’s the whole thing. 

&lt;checks again&gt;

Yup. That’s it. No evidence provided. No data presented. Just “cells are complicated!” and then half-assed evasions of four things he *thinks* biologists use to argue for evolutionary theory, except he even gets those wrong because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I really don’t think those are deliberate straw men, I think he’s just that clueless. 

What a tool. Textbook liar for Jesus. Gritted out a Ph.D. so he could play a scientist on the internet, without actually understanding any of the words he's using. What a fraud, and an insult to real scientists who put in time and effort and did and continue to do real work. I have nothing but contempt for this charlatan.

DebateEvolution,5ttv3g,RussianChick2007,,t2_xk1aj,self.DebateEvolution,,"Creationist Scientist Dr. Nathaniel's Jeanson's rebuttal to the article ""Creationists Invent Their Own Mutation Rate!"" which criticizes his research regarding mutation rates &amp; mitochondrial DNA. Any science experts care to check out his response and share their thoughts with me?","Dr. Jeanson's response to article (http://www.evoanth.net/2016/05/23/invent-mutation-rate/)

i) The main claim is that my mutation rate is 35x faster than the published one. In fact, if you look at the article the author cites, the ""published"" rate (Soares et al) is one derived first assuming evolution and millions of years, and then fitting facts to these conclusions. For example, Soares et al first assume an ancient timescale (the very fact that my research contradicts), and then fit DNA differences to this timescale. Not only is this circular reasoning (i.e., assuming evolution to prove evolution), it's also indirect science. It's analogous to trying to measure the rate of erosion in the Grand Canyon...by measuring the depth of the Canyon, assigning millions-of-years dates to each layer, and then calculating the rate of erosion...rather than actually physically measuring it. So the main claim of the blog you cited is not a logically sound or scientifically compelling argument against my published work.

ii) ""By adding null results from small studies like this he could effectively fine tune his mutation rate."" Here, the blog author accuses me of dishonesty. In fact, my goal in citing these additional studies were for the purpose of complete transparency and rigor. I cited all possible studies I could find. If the author of the blog really wanted to accuse me of cherry-picking, the author should have cited many studies I missed (which the author doesn't do).

iii) The author tries to explain away my published mutation rate by invoking three possible scenarios under which my actual mutation rate would drop. 
The first scenario envisions a movement from heteroplasmy to homoplasmy; the author thinks this is not a mutation. For the sake of argument, let's grant the author this conclusion. But now let's take it to its logical conclusion. Ask: Where did the heteroplasmic mutations come from? The only possible answer is mutation. Therefore, perhaps we should look at changes in heteroplasmic mutations, rather than changes in homoplasmic. If you look at the same table from the Ding study, you will find that the rate of heteroplasmic changes is 4x higher than the homoplasmic ones--which makes the problems for evolution even worse. So this argument doesn't stand up to scrutiny. (In fact, sticking to homoplasmic mutations is the most scientifically conservative approach to this question, for reasons that get into significant technical depth.) 
The second scenario and third scenarios invoke a similar principle--that I scored somatic mutations rather than germline ones. In theory, this could be a valid objection. But, again, let's take it to its logical conclusion. For example, the author of the blog took for granted that number of mitochondrial DNA differences among the different people groups. But how many of these have been validated as germline changes and not somatic ones? For example, the author has no problem with my citation of 123 differences being the max difference between two humans--but how does the blog author know that these differences are germline ones? Furthermore, the evolutionary mitochondrial Eve and out-of-Africa model is founded on the assumption that mitochondrial differences among ethnic groups are germline. Should this be questioned now as well? If the author of the blog is not careful, he will soon undermine the entire mitochondrial DNA field! 
But for sake of argument, let's conservatively say that this germline-somatic dilemma is enough to prevent us from reliably inferring a mutation rate from the Ding study. What does the blog author suggest that we invoke instead? The logically circular rate derived from Soares et al?

Let me further address these second and third scenarios with some questions of my own for the blog author:

-If the rate I cited from Ding's data is invalid, why does it agree with the 7+ studies that have been published previously? (See Table 4 of the following paper, as well as the discussion therein: https://answersingenesis.org/.../recent-functionally.../) Why is there such strong scientific consistency across multiple independent scientific studies? If the blog author wishes to question the conclusions of the one study he cites, he has a lot more evaluating and explaining to do than the single paper with which he interacts.

-Why do mitochondrial DNA clocks point towards a young-earth and reject a millions-of-years timescale for every other species in which the mitochondrial DNA mutation rate has been measured? (See the following: https://answersingenesis.org/.../spectacular.../; https://answersingenesis.org/.../on-the-origin-of.../) Please note: In the fruit fly, roundworm, water flea, and yeast mitochondrial mutation rate studies, the rates were measured in mutation accumulation lines--in other words, over several generations of genealogically-related individuals. Almost by definition, these studies measure germline mutations--not somatic ones. Why do all of these studies agree so strongly?

-What testable predictions does the blog author's model make? This is the gold standard of science--the one to which creationists have been held for years. If the blog author thinks that he has a better answer than what I have published, I challenge him to make scientifically testable predictions from it. For example, from my young-earth creation model, I can predict (i.e., I'm claiming that I can) the mitochondrial mutation rate in the millions of species in which it has yet to be measured. I'm willing to test my predictions in the lab. I challenge the blog author to do the same. Otherwise, by the evolutionists' own standards, the blog author's claims pseudoscience.

You might have noticed that these three questions that I ask refer to an extensive literature that has already been published on this topic--literature with which the blog author never interacts. You could almost say that the author seems to be cherry-picking which studies to address and which ones to ignore. I'm not saying this to accuse--my actual opinion on the subject is that I presume that he has no idea that this published literature exists. Rather, my point is saying this is to show that the ""cherry-picking"" stereotype can cut both ways.

This ribozyme contains 74 nt and catalyzes formation of a 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage with a catalytic rate of 0.016 min(-1). The RNA adopts a simple secondary structure based on a three-way junction motif, with ligation occurring at the end of a stem region located several nucleotides away from the junction. Cytidine was introduced to the cytidine-free ribozyme in a combinatorial fashion and additional rounds of in vitro evolution were carried out to allow the molecule to adapt to this added component. The resulting cytidine-containing ribozyme formed a 3',5' linkage with a catalytic rate of 0.32 min(-1).

Note: This is just a quick show-case for the tip of the iceberg. There is *way* more to say about this particular study (which entailed several additional studies done on the same enzyme). It is also not the first self-replicating Ribozyme obtained via in-vitro evolution, but it was the first one who had an easy to find link to the original paper.

[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652413/) is a further summary of the studies done with this particular Ribozyme and further annotations for anyone interested.

**""Self-sustained Replication of an RNA Enzyme""**

Note that the studies which followed the above study are absolutely crucial as an addition to the original study, as it contains the multiple trials that have been done using this Ribozyme.

This is just to showcase what people mean when they say ""We **do** have evidence for the RNA-World.""

DebateEvolution,5qqz7p,Dataforge,,t2_6ozaq,self.DebateEvolution,,The relationship between evolution and abiogenesis.,"User u/HighLocke has made a thread conflating the issue of abiogenesis with evolution. Specifically he asks ""How can you have evolution without abiogenesis?""

He's not the first creationist to make the claim that evolution is dependant on abiogenesis, to the point that we should reject evolution if abiogenesis cannot be proven.

So the question is, are evolution and abiogenesis related? The answer is yes, they most definitely are:

* They are both categorised under biology. Although some might argue that abiogenesis is more related to chemistry.
* They are both part of the natural history of Earth.
* They are both accepted by the majority of atheists, although a minority may believe in something like panspermia instead.

But evolution and abiogenesis being related does not mean what a lot of creationists claim; that evolution depends on abiogenesis.

I honestly wonder how creationists can come to that conclusion, because I've never heard a proper explanation for why that's the case. Indeed even the most cursory logic would show that evolution and abiogenesis are independant of each other.

Evolution states that a single common ancestor evolved into all life on Earth. What happened before that is completely irrelevant, as long as the end result was life existing. 

I do understand that creationism deals with the creation of life, so a discussion of the naturalistic origin of life is relevant to that discussion. But here's the problem: If you were to somehow disprove abiogenesis you are still left with 4 billion years of history that disagrees with creationism. Disproving abiogenesis isn't going to make all of that go away.

The whole argument does beg an interesting question: If disproving abiogenesis would disprove evolution, then does proving evolution prove abiogenesis? Can we prove that life formed naturally 4 billion years ago by investigating fossil hominids in the last 6 million years? Logically that must be the case if creationists are right about evolution depending on abiogenesis. Of course they're not right, and any rational mind knows that multiple theories and hypotheses can exist independently, and require independent lines of evidence.

Finally, the real reason creationists make this claim is obvious: They want it to be true. Really, that's it. It's as simple as it is wrong. They desperately want to intellectually justify their beliefs, and the easiest way to do that is to attack the weakest link, and pretend that brings the whole house of cards down.",102,1485650177,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5qqz7p/the_relationship_between_evolution_and_abiogenesis/

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2416-why-intelligent-design-qualifies-as-a-scientific-theory



Hypothesis (Prediction): Natural structures will be found that contain many parts arranged in intricate patterns, metabolic pathways similar to electronic circuits, sophisticated language and translation  systems,  indicating high levels of  Information,  and interdependence, like hard/software. No information, nor codes or ciphers ( translators ) can exist and will be found without an initial mental source, since information is, by its nature, a mental and not a material quantity. 

Observation: The genetic code system is a language , and the universal code is nearly optimal and maximally efficient ( only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the genetic code ).  Genomes use the genetic code to write two separate languages, beside a cipher, to translate codon triplets into a amino-acid ""alphabet"" constituent of 20 different left handed amino acids to make proteins.  One code describes how proteins are made, and the other instructs the cell on how genes are controlled and when expressed. There are 13 characteristics of human language. DNA shares 10 of them ( all LEVELS of Information: Statistics, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics, Aprobatics are used )  This comparison between cell language and human language is not a loose analogy - it’s  literal. Human language and cell language both employ multilayered symbols to produce a blueprint - required to describe a artifact, and in biology, a organism. 

   DNA sequences that code for proteins need to convey, in addition to the protein-coding information, several different signals at the same time. These “parallel codes” include binding sequences for regulatory and structural proteins, signals for splicing, and RNA secondary structure. The universal genetic code can efficiently carry arbitrary parallel codes much better than the vast majority of other possible genetic codes. This property is related to the identity of the stop codons. We find that the ability to support parallel codes is strongly tied to another useful property of the genetic code—minimization of the effects of frame-shift translation errors. Whereas many of the known regulatory codes reside in nontranslated regions of the genome, the present findings suggest that protein-coding regions can readily carry abundant additional information. The output are thousands of essential proteins and enzymes required for life;   sophisticated molecular machinery is needed to replicate the code (for inheritance/perpetuation), transcribe it, translate it into protein with many intermediate steps requiring highly specific operations, and to repair it in the foreseen event that it is damaged (to preserve/protect it) or destroy it in the event that it suffers irreparable damage (to forestall cancer).  Beside the standard genetic code, other 23 genetic codes are known, beside epigenetic codes, that is, the Splicing Code, the Metabolic Code, the Signal Transduction Codes,  the Signal Integration Codes , the Histone Code,  the Tubulin Code, the Sugar Code, and the Glycomic Code, all essential to define a organism and phenotype. 

Experiment :
One language is written on top of the other, which is why the second language remained hidden for so long. Biologic systems and processes cannot be fully accounted for in terms of the principles and laws of physics and chemistry alone, but they require in addition the principles of semiotics—the science of symbols and signs, including linguistics.  Summarizing the state of the art in the study of the code evolution,  science cannot escape considerable skepticism. It seems that the two-pronged fundamental questions: “why is the genetic code the way it is and how did it come to be?”, that was asked over 50 years ago, at the dawn of molecular biology, might remain pertinent even in another 50 years, if methodological naturalism is adopted, and only natural explanations for its orgin are permitted. The consolation is that scientists cannot think of a more fundamental problem in biology. Despite extensive and, in many cases, elaborate attempts to model code optimization, ingenious theorizing along the lines of the coevolution theory, and considerable experimentation, very little definitive progress has been made.

 Intelligent agents  act frequently  with an end goal in mind, constructing  complex  multipart-machines, that require a blueprint to build the object. Furthermore, Computers   integrate  software/hardware and store  high levels of instructional complex coded information. In our experience, systems that either a) require or b) store  large amounts of specified / instructed complex information  such as codes and languages, and which are constructed in a interdependence of hard and software invariably originate from an intelligent source. No exception. There is a presence of an identical feature in both DNA and intelligently designed codes, languages, and artifacts. Because we know intelligent agents can (and do) produce complex and functionally specified sequences of symbols and arrangements of matter, intelligent agency qualifies as an adequate causal explanation for the origin of this effect. Since, in addition, materialistic theories have proven universally inadequate for explaining the origin of coded information and translation systems, intelligent causation  stands as the only entity with the causal power known to produce this feature of living systems. 

Falsification:  Nobody has yet been able to demonstrate naturally emerging informational systems based on codes and ciphers, and instructional information stored within these codes to produce a defined complex specified outcome. Perry Marshall, author of the book Evolution 2.0, has yet to pay the prize to someone that will come up and will meet the challenge.

Objection: Intelligent design is not science
Answer: Intelligent design  is falsifiable: any positive demonstration that instructional complex coded information as stored in DNA and epigenetic codes can easily be generated by non design mechanisms is a potential falsification of the ID theory

Objection: the evidence in the Dover trial disproves ID as a scientific theory
Answer: ask ANY real scientist, if he thinks the best way to proceed in scientific truth, is to have courts of law decide what scientific theories should be accepted.

Objection: Well, we don’t have another universe to compare ours to, and as Hume points out, that’s exactly the problem.
Answer: Its not a problem at all. We just need to define what distinguished designed objects from things that emerge randomly. 
1. High information content (or specified complexity) and irreducible complexity constitute strong indicators or hallmarks of (past) intelligent design.
2. Biological systems have a high information content (or specified complexity) and utilize subsystems that manifest irreducible complexity.
3. Naturalistic mechanisms or undirected causes do not suffice to explain the origin of information (specified complexity) or irreducible complexity.
4. Therefore, intelligent design constitutes the best explanations for the origin of information and irreducible complexity in biological systems.

The issue of origins is absolutely critical to all human thinking, human behavior and human life.  It is the foundation of our existence.  It is the foundation of our purpose.  It is the foundation of our destiny.  Without a right understanding of origins there's no way to comprehend ourselves.  There's no way to understand our earth, our universe or the ultimate meaning of anything. 5

When it comes to explain the possible mechanisms and  cause of origins, the physical universe,  life and biodiversity, usually three options are mentioned. Chance, physical necessity, and creation through the intelligence, will and power of a conscient agent. Lets give a closer look at the three options.

Chance. What kind of causal power has chance ? Chance expresses the odds or likelihood of a event  taking  place. Chance isn't a thing or a mechanism or a physical being or a causal agent. It's not a directing force. Chance doesn't make anything happen.  It's only a way to quantify the probability of a event taking place. But in modern thinking, chance is being transformed in the ingredient of evolution theory through random mutations, a causal ingredient of biodiversity. 2
Physical necessity is  the term that is given to the situation where something is forced to take a certain course of action. Events that are conditioned by some values, forces, laws , norms or goals.  In physics  the concept of necessity was applied  to cases of strict determination and restriction due to  so-called causal laws. Its the hypothesis that the constants and quantities had to have the values they do, so that the universe and the earth could not take any other course, than the one it did. 1,3 
Intelligent design/creation stands for guided, reason based , directed , planned , projected , programmed , information based,  goal-constrained, willed  causation by a conscient intelligent powerful eternal, non-caused agency. Chance and evolution could be a included mechanism in the intended goal, but that would in the end still be a intelligence-based process.

There are only these options when it comes to origins.  Either is there  a intelligent creator, or there is not. Those are the only  options.  If there is no God, then everything is a result of ..... what exactly ? 
Chance , as exposed above, isn't a thing. Physical necessity could only act  once a physical universe exists. Beyond the universe, there were no physical laws. 

Once its granted that no thing has no causal powers, its evident the universe could not have emerged from absolutely nothing. Nobody times nothing equals everything is irrational to the extreme ( nontheless, some very ""smart"" people think that proposition makes sense, and write extensive books about the subject ). Or, behind this complex universe is an incomprehensibly intelligent and powerful eternal being who made everything. 

Genesis 1:1 is unique in all literature, all science, and all philosophy.  Every other system of cosmogony explaining the universe, whether in ancient religious myths or modern scientific models, starts with eternal matter, or eternal energy in some form.  Only the book of Genesis starts with eternal God.  Genesis then is the book of the origin of the universe.

In Genesis we find the origin of order, information, and complexity.  There is order, there are physical laws that function of fixed rules, there is information, and there is life based on cells, that are equivalent to factories and complex irreducible machines.  Order , coded information and complexity never arise spontaneously.  They are always generated by a prior cause programmed to produce these things simultaneously. 

We also find in Genesis the origin of life, the marvels of the reproductive process.  The almost infinite complexity programmed into the genetic system of plants and animals are inexplicable apart from special creation by a great, supernatural, powerful intelligence.

Genesis tells us about the origin of man, the most highly organized and complex entity in the universe, the origin of marriage,  the remarkable universal and stable institution of marriage as having been ordained by the Creator; the origin of evil.  The origin of physical and moral evil in the universe is explained in Genesis as a kind of temporary intrusion into God's perfect world, allowed by God as a concession to the principle of human freedom and responsibility and also to manifest Himself as Redeemer of sinners as well as Creator. In the book of Genesis you find the origin of salvation by grace through God's mercy and a substitute.  That's all in Genesis and it starts to show as God is merciful to Adam and Eve and doesn't kill them, even though they deserved to die for their sin.  In the book of Genesis that we find the origin of language. How you go from apes to man not just making some physical transition, but developing language, how you go from grunting and making unintelligible noises to human speech. is unexplained by modern science as well. The gulf between the mindless, instinctive chattering of animals and the intelligent, abstract, symbolic communication of man is absolutely and completely unbridgeable by any evolutionary process. You find in Genesis the origin of culture.  You find here such things as urbanization, the development of metallurgy, music, agriculture, animal husbandry, writing, education, navigation, textiles and ceramics.  All of that starts in the book of Genesis. You find in the book of Genesis the origin of religion.  Both the true religion and false religions appear, first of all, in the book of Genesis. 

Science knows nothing about origins. No wonder, when pressed hard, the last outcome most atheists come up with , is ignorance. We don't know yet. Science is working on it. 

Open questions in biology, biochemistry, and evolution

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2299-open-questions-in-biology-biochemistry-and-evolution

When methodological naturalism is applied, the only explanation for the origin of life is abiogenesis, and of biodiversity, Darwins Theory of evolution. Proponents repeat like a mantra : Evolution is a fact. If that were the case, there would exist far more convincing , clear scientific answers to  almost all relevant scientific questions and issues. This is far from being the case. Based on scientific papers, quite a different picture arises. Instead of compelling answers, questionmarks and lack of understanding, generalized ignorance in regard of almost all relevant issues,  and conceptual problems are the most common. Since the information is widely sparse and scattered amongst thousands of scientific papers, its not so evident that this is the factual state of matter. The general public is duped by effect slogans, that give the false impression of certainty of naturalism. The standard answer, when proponents of naturalism are confronted with this situation, is: ""We are working on it"". Or: ""We don't know yet"". 

Objection: more possible causal mechanisms exist, maybe even a infinity. 
Answer: What can be asserted without evidence, can be discarted without evidence. 

Objection:the universe isn't obliged in any to conform to our model of reality. Just look at Einstein's relativity theories. They demonstrate that the universe can confound us.  That justifies not become attached to any viewpoint. 
Answer: Even if a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is not fully understood, the possible mechanisms to explain our existence are still the same.

So far, I've been  breezing through the stupid crap this brochure presents as reason to ""doubt"" the theory of evolution. One sentence, however, is so seemingly ridiculous that I want another set of eyes to confirm.


Under the section ""Evolution- Myths and Facts"", the writer heavily cites an article from the October 1991 issue of *Scientific American*.


The writer of the brochure states this exactly:

""They also noticed that some of the different “species” of finches were interbreeding and producing offspring that survived better than the parents. They concluded that if the interbreeding continued, it could result in the fusion of two “species” into just one.""

Given that human beings have roughly 125 mutations in their genome different than either parent is 3.8 billion years of life enough time for the diversity we see to occur? I mean given that sexual reproduction only occurred 1.2 billion years ago and before that mutation rates were much much lower is there enough time for the monumentous number of changes and speciation to occur? 

I'm currently taking an evolution class and we were talking about the mutation of an allele in mice that produces a dark coat compared to a sandy one. Based on the mutation rate, population, and generational time frame it would only take 1000 years for this mutation to occur naturally and just braking down the math that 3.8 billion/1000 = 3.8 million mutations.

Why do atheists all the time ask for empirical proofs for Gods existence ? If you lack belief in a deity, yet spend tons of time debating people who DO believe in God and seeking to shoot holes in their  beliefs, does this mean they  are seeking to find God in a roundabout way (desiring to be persuaded)? Or does it mean that they think they are justifying in their non-belief  and making themself feel better and more warranted / justified to disbelieve in God by shooting down the believers in a creator ? 1

A common argument is that there is no evidence or proof for Gods existence, and what cannot be backed up with evidence, can be dismissed without evidence. 
Whatever couldn’t be proven or disproven was in the  “realm of fiction or hallucinations.... . But why the demand that proponents of intelligent design / creationism must produce empirical conclusive proofs for Gods existence, as if that is the be-all and end-all of all epistemological inquiry? Often, when i ask atheists, what evidence would convince them that design explains best the origin of what is observed in the natural world, they give no answer. Truth said, most of them never thought about the question. What would they consider good or compelling evidence and how would they define what is evidence of design in nature ? The question they must answer is : “what evidence would you find compelling?” 

There is a huge body of work from many serious thinkers arguing the theistic God; there is no such body of work painstakingly arguing in favor of Santa Claus (i.e., the mythical figure), the tooth fairy, leprechauns, unicorns, mermaids. That’s why the theistic claim is a lot more credible.

It is much more plausible that the universe came about by the causal agency of God than by self-causation or random chance. We should accept the claims by virtue of the demands of rationality and plausibility, by which we also determine whether anything else is true.

Its pointless to ask for proofs. Thats on the lowest level of a atheism - theism debate, reserved to the ones that have no education in philosophy and science.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1397-biosynthesis-o-amino-acids

Could the oxygen and nitrogen cicle be explained by naturalistic means ? The reason for the abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere is the presence of a very large number of organisms which produce oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae became the first microbes to produce oxygen by photosynthesis. They are one of the oldest bacteria that live on earth, said to exist perhaps as long  as 3.5 billion years. And their capabilities are nothing more than astounding.  No cianobacteria, no oxygen, no higher life forms. These cianobacterias have incredibly sophisticated enzyme proteins and metabolic pathways, like the electron transport chains, ATP synthase motors, circadian clock, the photosynthetic light reactions, carbon concentration mechanism, and transcriptional regulation , they produce binded nitrogen through nitrogenase, a highly sophisticated mechanism to bind nitrogen, used as a nutrient for plant and animal growth.

The Nitrogen cycle is a lot more complex than the carbon cycle. Nitrogen is a very important element. It makes up almost 80% of our atmosphere, and it is an important component of proteins and DNA, both of which are the building blocks of animals and plants. Therefore without nitrogen we would lose one of the most important elements on this planet, along with oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. There are a number of stages to the nitrogen cycle, which involve breaking down and building up nitrogen and it’s various compounds.There is no real starting point for the nitrogen cycle. It is an endless cycle. Potential gaps in the system cannot be reasonably bypassed by inorganic nature alone. It must have a degree of specificity that in all probability could not have been produced by chance.

A given function or step in the system may be found in several different unrelated organisms. The removal of any one of the individual biological steps will resort in the loss of function of the system. The data suggest that the nitrogen cycle may be irreducibly interdependent based on the above criteria. No proposed neo-Darwinian mechanisms can explain the origin of such a system.The ultimate source of nitrogen for the biosynthesis of amino acids is atmospheric nitrogen (N2), a nearly inert gas. Its needed by all living things to build proteins and nucleic acids. This is one of the hardest chemical bonds of all to break. So, how can nitrogen be brought out of its tremendous reserves in the atmosphere and into a state where it can be used by living things? 

To be metabolically useful, atmospheric nitrogen must be reduced. It must be converted to a useful form. Without ""fixed"" nitrogen, plants, and therefore animals, could not exist as we know them. This process, known as nitrogen fixation, occurs through lightening, but most  in certain types of bacteria, namely cianobacteria. Even though nitrogen is one of the most prominent chemical elements in living systems, N2 is almost unreactive (and very stable) because of its triple bond (N≡N). This bond is extremely difficult to break because the three chemical bonds need to be separated and bonded to different compounds. Nitrogenase is the only family of enzymes capable of breaking this bond (i.e., it carries out nitrogen fixation). Nitrogenase is a very complex enzyme system. Nitrogenase genes are distributed throughout the prokaryotic kingdom, including representatives of the Archaea as well as the Eubacteria and Cyanobacteria.With assistance from an energy source (ATP) and a powerful and specific complementary reducing agent (ferredoxin), nitrogen molecules are bound and cleaved with surgical precision.

In this way, a ‘molecular sledgehammer’ is applied to the NN bond, and a single nitrogen molecule yields two molecules of ammonia. The ammonia then ascends the ‘food chain’, and is used as amino groups in protein synthesis for plants and animals. This is a very tiny mechanism, but multiplied on a large scale it is of critical importance in allowing plant growth and food production on our planet to continue. ‘Nature is really good at it (nitrogen-splitting), so good in fact that we've had difficulty in copying chemically the essence of what bacteria do so well.’ If one merely substitutes the name of God for the word 'nature', the real picture emerges.These proteins use a collection of metal ions as the electron carriers that are responsible for the reduction of N2 to NH3. All organisms can then use this reduced nitrogen (NH3) to make amino acids. In humans, reduced nitrogen enters the physiological system in dietary sources containing amino acids. One thing is certain—that matter obeying existing laws of chemistry could not have created, on its own, such a masterpiece of chemical engineering.Without cyanobacteria - no fixed nitrogen is available.Without fixed nitrogen, no DNA, no amino-acids, no protein can be synthesised. Without DNA, no amino-acids,protein, or cyanobacteria are possible.

First of all, this line of reasoning makes no sense because the big bang isn't related to evolution. Secondly, even with a creator we would still have the same problem.

&amp;nbsp;

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5mgp6h/how_you_can_provide_a_better_world_view_based_on/) mentioned the argument:

""or if we propose that the universe is eternal in any kind of form, like a multiverse, oscillating universe etc. , and had no beginning, how we can reach the present from eternity. If we add one event after the other starting now, whenever we stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. How can we then reach now from ( past ) eternity by adding one event after the other ?""

&amp;nbsp;

But even with a god, or creator, or intelligent designer we run into the exact same problem.

&amp;nbsp;

Every time the origin of the universe is brought up, especially Kalam style, god or the creator or the intelligent designer is almost always said to be timeless. Eternal. Existing outside of time. This is done, I believe, for two reasons. First, to find a way to avoid the ""everything had to have a cause"" argument by placing something outside of the rules, and secondly to give us that mythical exception to the rule that ""makes it all work."" However it doesn't work.

&amp;nbsp;

How long did this timeless force wait to start the universe? Oh wait, it is ""outside of time"" so it can be infinite/eternal. The problem is if you are outside of time, 1 second, and 1 planck, and  a googleplex of millennia are all equal. If you don't experience time, you have no frame of reference. So how many infinitely long eternities did this creating force exist by itself before deciding to create something?

&amp;nbsp;

Logically speaking, from my point of view at least, if something did exist ""outside of time"" its entire existence, no matter how infinite it is, would necessarily be simultaneous. Again, without having a way to separate a second from a year or a millennia everything that being or force did would have to be simultaneous, because to exist ""outside of time"" is to exist outside of causality. So there is no logical way for an outside timeless cause to be the start of our universe because it would have to have caused the universe as soon as it began to exist otherwise it could never have gotten around to creating the universe at all, which would make the universe as eternal as the outside force. And if the universe has to be eternal because of the outside force, we agree the universe can be eternal and thus can save a step by saying the universe is eternal without need of a outside cause.",19,1484047406,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5n4ikr/can_goda_creator_count_to_infinity_xpost_from/

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2407-how-you-can-provide-a-better-world-view-based-on-naturalism-strong-atheism-over-a-proponent-of-creationism-intelligent-design



Positive or strong atheism proposes  that ( most probably ) no deities exist. If we held that position, and that adequate answers exist which top creationism/intelligent design in explanatory power without the need for a powerful intelligent creative agency, we are at least going to have to provide sufficient positive compelling explanations based on philosophical naturalism, which points to the fact that the natural world can have a origin by its own, without the need of a God.  Some things happen because of an intelligent agency, some things don't.  Materialists don't believe in agency at all. So , how can this view be backed up rationally ?  

This view implies that we need good answers of how absolutely nothing magically can turn  into a Big Bang and life supporting universe and create the physical laws simultaneously, or if we propose that the universe is eternal in any kind of form, like a multiverse, oscillating universe etc. , and had no beginning,  how we can reach the present from eternity. If we add one event after the other starting now, whenever we stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. How can we then reach now from ( past ) eternity by adding one event after the other ? Furthermore, we have to explain how the second law of thermodynamics would be overcome. 

Then, its required that we  give good reasons of how random unguided forces  finetuned sucessfully the expansion of the Big Bang out of 10^120 attempts and possibilities ( thats a 10 with 120 zeroes ) , the four fundamental forces like gravity, which strength  is finely tuned to a precision of  one of 14 billion billion billion settings, and hundreds of physical parameters, and the conditions to permit life on earth. Its not that life adapted to the universe. The parameters had to be finely tuned right from the start;  If not, no universe could exist at all .  How life can emerge from non-life and produce  cells ? 

The cell is an interdependent functional city. We state, “The cell is the most detailed and concentrated organizational structure known to humanity. It is a lively microcosmic city, with factories for making building supplies, packaging centers for transporting the supplies, trucks that move the materials along highways, communication devices, hospitals for repairing injuries, a massive library of information, power stations providing usable energy, garbage removal, walls for protection and city gates for allowing certain materials to come and go from the cell.” The notion of the theoretical first cell arising by natural causes is a perfect example of irreducibly complexity. Life cannot exist without many numerous interdependent complex systems, each irreducibly complex on their own, working together to bring about a grand pageant for life to exist.

How could cells emerge through unguided, accidental random events, and luck was able to create  the storage device of information in DNA, transcription and translation machinery inside cells , invent a optimal genetic code, better and less error prone than one million alternatives, a translation system ( a genetic cipher, that equals to translation from english to chinese ) , and incalculable amount of precise instructions to create the first  self-replicating cell with a minimal number of precisely dimensioned and fitting parts, precise energy supply where needed for various chemical reactions, a error check and repair system all along the cellular processes, and  millions of amazingly diverse species with the ability to evolve and adapt to the environment, and explain the emergence of conscient intelligent minds from inanimated  matter. Furthermore, we have to give good reasons why it could be justified in exeptional circumstances  to torture, rape and kill little babies for fun. If we can't, we would grant that absolute, objective moral values exist. Since they are prescriptive, we would have to grant the existence of a moral giver or moral code prescriber above us.

We can also not afford us to commit the logical fallacy to make affirmative conclusions based on a negative premise. This illicit negative  occurs when a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion, but one or two negative premises. We need to be able to present and adopt a well-articulated, thorough-going positive world view based on positive evidence that results in good reasons to infer naturalism. What we have to present, is a positive case for  strong atheism by reference to the evidence that favours a naturalistic  interpretation of reality. Asking to provide positive, compelling evidence that points to the fact that the natural world can have a origin by its own, is not the same as to ask for evidence that God does not exist. If we are going to argue that adequate answers exist without the need for a creative intelligent powerful agency with will, we are at least going to have to provide sufficient naturalistic explanations.",81,1483741967,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5mgp6h/how_you_can_provide_a_better_world_view_based_on/

Wanna Build a Cell? A DVD Player Might Be Easier Imagine that you’re building the world’s first DVD player. What must you have before you can turn it on and watch a movie for the first time?

A DVD. How do you get a DVD? You need a DVD recorder first. How do you make a DVD recorder? First you have to define the language. When Russell Kirsch (who we met in chapter Cool created the world’s first digital image, he had to define a language for images first. Likewise you have to define the language that gets written on the DVD, then build hardware that speaks that language. Language must be defined first. Our DVD recorder/player problem is an encoding-decoding problem, just like the information in DNA. You’ll recall that communication, by definition, requires four things to exist:

1. A code
2. An encoder that obeys the rules of a code
3. A message that obeys the rules of the code
4. A decoder that obeys the rules of the code

These four things—language, transmitter of language, message, and receiver of language—all have to be precisely defined in advance before any form of communication can be possible at all.



A camera sends a signal to a DVD recorder, which records a DVD. The DVD player reads the DVD and converts it to a TV signal. This is conceptually identical to DNA translation. The only difference is that we don’t know how the original signal—the pattern in the first DNA strand—was encoded. The first DNA strand had to contain a plan to build something, and that plan had to get there somehow. An original encoder that translates the idea of an organism into instructions to build the organism (analogous to the camera) is directly implied.

The rules of any communication system are always defined in advance by a process of deliberate choices. There must be prearranged agreement between sender and receiver, otherwise communication is impossible. By definition, a communication system cannot evolve from something simpler because evolution itself requires communication to exist first. You can’t make copies of a message without the message, and you can’t create a message without first having a language. And before that, you need intent. A code is an abstract, immaterial, nonphysical set of rules. There is no physical law that says ink on a piece of paper formed in the shape T-R-E-E should correspond to that large leafy organism in your front yard. You cannot derive the local rules of a code from the laws of physics, because hard physical laws necessarily exclude choice. On the other hand, the coder decides whether “1” means “on” or “off.” She decides whether “0” means “off” or “on.” Codes, by definition, are freely chosen. The rules of the code come before all else. These rules of any language are chosen with a goal in mind: communication, which is always driven by intent. That being said, conscious beings can evolve a simple code into a more complex code—if they can communicate in the first place. But even simple grunts and hand motions between two humans who share no language still require communication to occur. Pointing to a table and making a sound that means “table” still requires someone to recognize what your pointing finger means.

The show most certainly would have appeared very convincing to one not educated in biological sciences. For one thing they proposed the evolution of legs from a fish that was trying to escape being eaten by another fish. The problem is that for this to be factual, the organism would have had to develop fully functional legs in the water for them to offer any advantage and another thing is that this 'walking fish' would have had to simultaneously develop the capability to breathe air through lungs and not by filtering oxygen from water through gills. Neither did they present the example of the Mudskipper fish that exists today as an apparent missing link in the evolution chain. If evolution works to develop new species, why does this 'missing link' still exist?

My perspective is that evolutionists go too far in how much they claim ToE adequately explains the origin of different species. Horses and donkeys are very similar and they produce a viable, but sterile mule. The horse and donkey differ in chromosomal number due to a Robertsonian fusion that results in abnormal chromosomal pairing in meiosis and near complete male sterility. In order for this fused chromosome to become homozygous then two individuals with exactly the same mutation must find and mate with each other. 

For argument sake, let's say the frequency of a fusion is 1 in 1,000. Now, a horse has 32 pairs of chromosomes and a donkey has 31 pairs. Assuming a random occurrence of fusions there are 496 permutations of all possible combinations. Therefore the frequency of an individual with a particular fusion would be 1 in 496,000. The frequency of a male and a female each with a particular fused chromosome is 1/496,0000 X 1/496,000 = 1/246 billion. Now that doesn't sound so terribly bad, but consider that the original male and female would have to be heterozygous for the mutation and therefore almost certainly sterile due to the aforementioned abnormal chromosome pairing in meiosis. Let's say the male is 1% fertile and the female is 10% fertile (due to spermatogenesis being more sensitive to aberrations) which means 1/1,000 such matings would produce an offspring. Now we are down to a probability of 1 in 246 trillion, but wait we are not through yet. When two heterozygous (each carry a normal + mutant chromosome) individuals mate only 1 in 4 offspring are homozygous for the mutation. Now we are down to 1 in roughly 1 quadrillion (10 to the 15th power) to get a single individual that is homozygous for the mutation. What about getting two individuals that are homozygous for the mutation finding each other and mating? Well that is 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 X 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 = 0.000000000000000000000000000001. Needless to say, but there most certainly haven't ever been that many horse-like matings in all of history. You may argue that with enough time even this ridiculously low probability will become a certainty, but for me it is so close to zero that for all reasonably practical purposes the probability IS ZERO.

But scientists are not emotionally attached to the idea of evolution like creationists are emotionally attached to the idea of God creating everything. Scientists do not ""care"" about evolution, it is simply the best-fitting explanation for the data we have. They have no reason to be biased against evidence that contradicts evolution.


Scientists do not want to waste their time studying something that is false.

____

**Discovery:**

&amp;nbsp;

The ApoA-1 Milano mutation was found by University of Milan researchers after their 1974 investigation of a low HDL / high triglyceride phenotype exhibited by Valerio Dagnoli of Limone sul Garda, a small village in northern Italy. Limone had only 1,000 inhabitants at the time and when blood tests were run on the entire population of the village, the mutation was found to be present in about 3.5% of the local population.

The mutation was traced to one man, Giovanni Pomarelli, who lived in the village in the late 18th century and passed it on to his offspring.

[The paper describing the method to identify patient zero.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1684746/)

It is characterised by the replacement of arginine by cysteine at position 173.

[The paper describing the exact amino acid change.](http://www.jbc.org/content/258/4/2508.full.pdf+html)


___

**Efficacy:**

&amp;nbsp;

ApoA1 Milano was first identified by Dr. Cesare Sirtori in Milan, who also demonstrated that its presence significantly reduced cardiovascular disease, even though it caused a reduction in HDL levels and an increase in triglyceride levels.

Apo A-I Milano has been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in animal models and in a small phase 2 human trial. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) mediated Apo A-I Milano gene therapy in combination with low-cholesterol diet induces rapid and significant regression of atherosclerosis in mice.

Due to its enormous apparent efficacy, some have speculated that development of synthetic ApoA-1 Milano may be a key factor in eradicating coronary heart disease.

Esperion Therapeutics, a high tech venture capital start-up, demonstrated proof of efficacy in both animals and humans, spending many millions of dollars over several years to conduct a single human trial which showed impressive and rapid efficacy by IVUS of coronary arteries.",100,1482861495,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5kl0vh/apoa1_milano_a_recent_example_of_a_beneficial/

Chief,"Towards the end Geoffrey discusses big improvements having been made to traditional (neural RAM) ""neural network"" models by guessing which words will work in a (vocal motor system) sentence. A neural network addresses the information as he explains, in a hierarchy that goes from individual pixels on up to a ""percept"". 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvQlrvmD0AU

This is further evidence that the ID Lab model tested operational definition used in the [Theory of Intelligent Design](http://theoryofid.blogspot.com/) is true.

&gt; Behavior from a system or a device qualifies as intelligent by meeting all four circuit requirements that are required for this ability, which are: (1) A body to control, either real or virtual, with motor muscle(s) including molecular actuators, motor proteins, speakers (linear actuator), write to a screen (arm actuation), motorized wheels (rotary actuator). It is possible for biological intelligence to lose control of body muscles needed for movement yet still be aware of what is happening around itself but this is a condition that makes it impossible to survive on its own and will normally soon perish. (2) Random Access Memory (RAM) addressed by its sensory sensors where each motor action and its associated confidence value are stored as separate data elements. (3) Confidence (central hedonic) system that increments the confidence level of successful motor actions and decrements the confidence value of actions that fail to meet immediate needs. (4) Ability to guess a new memory action when associated confidence level sufficiently decreases. For flagella powered cells a random guess response is designed into the motor system by the reversing of motor direction causing it to “tumble” towards a new heading.

In the ID Lab model each of the RAM data locations is a separate ""percept"" that is addressed by serializing the sensory bits to a unique number/percept that can be read from, or written to by guessing a new motor action to try. Where there are only 7 bits of red, green and blue information and what is seen in the environment is not overly complex there is no need for as many layers of neurons as in our cerebral cortex, which is for sorting out a much larger amount of visual information into a single percept. 

Knowing how this relates to the four requirement operational definition (for obligatory theory of operation explaining how the ID Lab model works) should make it easy to understand what he is saying. You'll know what much of the jargon boils down to and where ""Neural Networks"" of the future are going. This is not something a science journal reviewer can give you. This is your personally being able to understand what this video is saying as it relates to the ID Lab models where the same is true.

DebateEvolution,5jo1dk,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Want more macroevolution? How about a plasmid becoming a virus?,"Before we start, some vocabulary:

Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA common in bacteria. They replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome, and often carry important genes. Antibiotic resistance and genes for conjugation are often found on plasmids, for example.

Geminiviruses are small, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that infect plants. They have two main genes.

The CP is the gene for the coat or capsid protein. That's the ""shell"" of the virus.

The Rep gene codes for the Rep protein, which is basically a ""copy me"" signal for the host cell. 

&amp;nbsp;

Geminiviruses are the result of a plasmid (which have Rep genes) acquiring a CP gene from an RNA virus. We know this because their CP sequences are nested within the phylogeny for RNA viruses, while their Rep sequences are not related to any other viral Reps, at least not closely. Their closest relatives are the Reps of certain types of plasmids. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since viruses, transposable elements, and plasmids all fall under the umbrella of ""mobile genetic elements,"" and horizontal gene transfer between mobile genetic elements is a common occurrence, the best explanation is that a plasmid, with its Rep gene, acquired a CP gene from a virus infecting the same cell. With that acquisition, that plasmid became a virus. 

&amp;nbsp;

How's that for macroevolution? Or is this just evolution ""within kinds""?

DebateEvolution,5jeidc,Desperado2583,,t2_lgq25,self.DebateEvolution,,Frauds like Piltdown Man vindicate evolution.,"Piltdown Man faced harsh criticism outside the UK immediately following its publication in 1915, particularly from French and American scientists. The American Museum of Natural History, in fact, refused to display the specimen as a single species. The exhibit was instead described as an assortment of fossilized human and chimpanzee remains, just as it was later discovered to be. 

It's not surprising that the specimen initially seemed to fit as the heralded ‘missing link’, it was, after all, specifically manufactured for this exact purpose. However, in the years following its ‘discovery’, while no one suspected outright fraud, Piltdown Man did become increasingly more difficult to explain. It did not fit into anyone's cladistic or phylogenetic models of common descent, nor did it seem possible for it to be a natural offshoot. It was as if someone had just unearthed a “crocoduck”, impossible from an evolutionary perspective and obviously not related to any other form of life known to have ever existed.  

The specimen was eventually shelved in hopes that it could, someday, be explained, and there it sat, out of sight and all but forgotten. Meanwhile, the scientific community moved on without Piltdown Man, the one piece of the puzzle that didn't seem to fit anywhere. Far from being the ‘crown jewel’ of evolution, as some creationists would like to paint it, it was, instead, evolution’s biggest nightmare. A curious anomaly. An outlier inexplicable by any data that was currently available, and the one fly that everyone tried to ignore in their soup bowl. 

By 1950, the chemical testing, we now consider standard, had just become available, and it was thought that perhaps a more modern examination of Piltdown Man may shed some light on its mysterious place in prehistory. The specimen was dug out of storage and once again saw the light of day for the first time in decades. 

Modern methods of dating and chemical analysis revealed, with almost trivial simplicity, that the bones had been faked. While relatively few openly expected this to be the case, this was practically the least surprising finding that could have been made. By this time our understanding of phylogeny had become complete enough that literally any other finding would have been a major upset to someone's research. The faking of the specimen, while understandably shocking to the entire scientific community, was the one solution that made sense to everyone. It caused almost no debate, no academic upheaval and the scientific world collectively breathed a sigh of relief. 

Errors, such as Nebraska Man, all tell a similar story, in that case the discoverer himself being the first to realize and openly admit his own mistake. In the case of real legitimate science, such as the theory of evolution, it's the errors and fakes that stand apart from the data and contradict the theoretical models, and, in nearly every case, are all but dismissed long before they are confirmed to be fraudulent. Once they are confirmed to be false, they are no longer upheld by any significant group of supporters. They're dismissed, forgotten and buried. 

Pseudoscientific woo woo, on the other hand, stubbornly clings to, and continues to propagate, ridiculous findings such as the Shroud of Turin and the discovery of Noah's Ark for decades even after they are thoroughly debunked. Pop cultural beliefs that support a creationist worldview, such as “humans use only 10% of their brains”, “there is no junk DNA”, “scientists continually find functions for structures thought to be vestigial” or “speciation had never been observed”, persist despite having no basis in reality. More academic pursuits, such as ‘flood geology’ and ‘irreducible complexity’, continue to be touted as legitimate fields of study even after having been proven conclusively to have no value outside of apologetics.

If you add one event after the other starting now, whenever you stop, the timelapse will always be a defined timespan. You cannot reach eternity by adding one event after the other. Thats why there cannot be a past eternity, otherwise we would never reach now.

Then the naturalist has to give good reasons of how randomness finetuned the expansion of the Big Bang, the fundamental forces, and hundreds of physical parameters, and the conditions to permit life on earth, how life can emerge from non-life through unguided, lucky events, and randomness was able to create the storage device, transcription and translation machinery , invent a optimal genetic code, translation code, and incalculable amount of precise instructions to create the first irreducible complex self-replicating cell, and millions of amazingly diverse species with the ability to evolve, and explain the emergence of conscient intelligent minds from inanimated matter ( quantum mechanics supports the idea that conscience/mind predates, and permeates all physical being.

Never ever should the word ""theory"" or the having been written by ""theorists"" be thought of as necessarily indicating that it has been tested to be true.

It is thus possible for a scientific theory to beforehand be proposed, then later developed. This is what the Discovery Institute did by stating *""The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""* then inviting scientists to help develop the theory that the premise describes. It's an idea you can test (hypothesis) that tests true by development of a theory that does not pertain to ""natural selection"" and explains how (what standard scientific naming convention would have to call) ""intelligent cause"" works, which in turn explains what happened.

Where enough people are passionate they will keep trying anything, until a breakthrough happens. That's what just happened for the ID movement. In fact the ID theory predicts that where there are a whole lot of best guesses being tried where confidence being true is tested the result is collective intelligence that learns new knowledge from old. Regardless of testing true or false: all hypotheses are equally valuable, blessed.

Kathy Martin helped bring to life an evo-word free science classroom demonstration introducing self-assembly to her peers (science teachers) while at the same time making it a mixing salad oil simple thing not something that needs evolution to explain. Spinoffs from the noisy public hearing for the ""theory of intelligent design"" made the whole thing worthwhile. Jack Krebs and others from KCFS can be proud for networking in help some of the best scientists in the world.

To be credible in science and engineering it's necessary for me to separate ID from religious arguments from creationism. But that's what BioLogos does for Darwinian theory, which contains the ""natural selection"" variable. As long as science is not (in favor of religious answers) neglected: it is OK to be religious about ID theory. Here's an example from me, by my use of a creative illustration pointer:

https://sites.google.com/site/intelligenceprograms/Home/Causation.GIF

The ID controversy has shown that ahead of time proposing then presenting for testing a theory like this can lead to great scientific benefit. And science has a way of in return making dreams come true, in ways you never could have beforehand dreamed of. What in time develops is way better but it can at first be hard to know what to make of it. Once the shock of things not normally turning out exactly as expected is over comes the realization that the walls you/we built within come/came tumbling down and a new world will begin. The theory that makes childhood dreams come true is finally safe, free to fly, and in turn without fear so are we. You made it here too:

This is my first post to reddit, so please have a little mercy on me.
 I am an atheist who has currently been debating a Theist friend of mine just about every time we see each other. He claims that Michael Behe, author of ""Darwin's Black Box"", has presented evolutionists with an insurmountable challenge; namely, that of irreducible complexity.
I did some research, and came to the conclusion that Behe's argument is simply a new spin on the argument from design. However, my friend did raise one interesting point. In discussion of the irreducible complexity of the bacterial flagellum, I referred him to a paper titled ""The Flagellum Unspun"", in which the bacterial flagellum is demonstrated to not be irreducibly complex. If 10 proteins are removed, the flagellum can still function as the Type III Secretory Apparatus. My friend's response to this was rather interesting. He claimed that the flagellum is still irreducibly complex, as the removal of a single protein would render it non-functional. He claimed that 10 proteins being removed was not a refutation of Behe's definition of Irreducible Complexity, and actually supported it. In his mind, there would need to be 10 simultaneous genetic mutations to go from the Type III Secretory Apparatus to the Bacterial Flagellum, and that this was further proof of Intelligent Design. He asked me to find an organism in which a single protein, and only a single protein, had been removed from the flagellum, and that still had a function.

Why is that? Because the traditional Neo-Darwinian mechanisms have failed to produce the kind of evolution that is assumed to have occurred. While endosymbiosis and HGT are interesting concepts, they don’t conquer the problem of accumulating significant genetic information by mutations. They just push it back. Think about it.



First of all, the scientists studying the amoeba Paulinella, have not witnessed the chromatophore incorporating in to the organism. They have assumed that this is the case. What they then do is look for evidence that this has indeed occurred. From the outset, this is circular reasoning. They make an assumption then set out to find evidence that supports the assumption. Whether that evidence is strong or weak will depend on the initial assumptions and bias of the researchers.

Let’s say for the sake of argument that this organism, Paulinella does indeed have an exceptionally well matched organelle to that of cyanobacteria…a plastid. What is the implication? Does it discern between various theories? No, it is predicted by either. In this case intelligent design theory also fits the evidence. Design is the purposeful use of common parts. 
 

Think about the implication of Paulinella acquiring an organelle through endosymbiosis. It would be a leap in genetic information for the amoeba, but of information that has already been “built”. The problem of accumulating genetic information through random mutation is not solved, only pushed back. The information for a functioning amoeba still needs to be built. The complex information for a chromatophore in the cyanobacteria  still had to “mutate” into existence  in the first place. Has this been demonstrated as possible? No. 

You might want to do some further reading to more critically analyze endosymbiosis . 

http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/backgrounder-some-challenges-offered-for-lynn-marguliss-endosymbiosis-theory/

  Endosymbiosis is undoubtedly a fascinating concept and, at first glance, the evidence appears to support it as the mechanism for the evolution of chloroplasts and mitochondria. But it really isn't very good evidence - it is questionable on two counts.
1. It supports the alternative hypothesis equally well (in fact some of the features of mitochondria may be explained better by the alternative hypothesis).
2. It is the wrong sort of evidence because none of these data have been shown to be synapomorphies between prokaryotes and organelles.""

The protists in the termite gut, for example, harbor endosymbiotic bacteria that make the proteins to break down cellulose. 

&amp;nbsp;

What is rare, at least we thought, was the transition of these endosymbiotic bacteria into true organelles. 

&amp;nbsp;

But now we're seeing an example of that very event in a type of amoeboid cell called Paulinella chromatophora. What's the evidence? Transfer of genes from the bacterial endosymbiont to the nuclear genome of the amoeboid. The endosymbiont has lost over half of it's genes, and many have been identified in the host's nuclear genome. But then when those genes are expressed, the proteins end up with the bacteria. Gene loss and protein import are keys step in organellogenesis. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even cooler is the timeframe. This is going on *right now*, and probably started only about 60 million years ago, as opposed to 1.5 *billion* for your typical chloroplasts. 

&amp;nbsp;

So this has a lot going on. Organellogenesis, horizontal gene transfer, complex interactions between two species. It's a textbook case of the evolution of a trait that, if creationists were right, cannot possibly evolve. But here it is, happening before our eyes.

Would you say that it is plausible that a tornado over a junkyard could produce a 747 ?
Would you say that it is plausible that mindless random chance can write a book, or produce the hardware and software of a computer ?
The cell is like a factory, that has various computer like hierarchically organized systems of hardware and software, various language based informational systems, a translation system, hudge amounts of precise instructional/specified, complex information stored and extract systems to make all parts needed to produce the factory and replicate itself, the scaffold structure, that permits the build of the indispensable protection wall, form and size of its building, walls with gates that permits cargo in and out, recognition mechanisms that let only the right cargo in, has specific sites and production lines, ""employees"", busy and instructed to produce all kind of necessary products, parts and subparts with the right form and size through the right materials, others which mount the parts together in the right order, on the right place, in the right sequence, at the right time, which has sophisticated check and error detection mechanisms all along the production process, the hability to compare correctly produced parts to faulty ones and discard the faulty ones, and repeat the process to make the correct ones; highways and cargo carriers that have tags which recognize where to drop the cargo where its needed, cleans up waste and has waste bins and sophisticated recycle mechanisms, storage departments, produces its energy and shuttles it to where its needed, and last not least, does reproduce itself.
The salient thing is that the individual parts and compartments have no function by their own. They had to emerge ALL AT ONCE, No stepwise manner is possible, all systems are INTERDEPENDENT and IRREDUCIBLE. And it could not be through evolution, since evolution depends on fully working self replicating cells, in order to function.
How can someone rationally argue that the origin of the most sophisticated factory in the universe would be probable to be based on natural occurence, without involving any guiding intelligence ?

DebateEvolution,5el9nf,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"I have a few days off, time for a new thread. HIV Vpu is a clear case of the evolution of novel functionality. Now stop claiming it can't happen. Come at me, creationists.","Tetherin is a protein that is a component of the human immune system (and the immune systems of other animals, but we care about the human version). Tetherin is so named because it prevents some viruses from escaping the surface of cells after they've infected and replicated. So viruses that can successfully infect humans have to overcome tetherin.

&amp;nbsp;

HIV-1 has a small protein called Vpu that antagonizes tetherin and allows HIV to escape from infected cells. SIVcpz (chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus, from which HIV-1 evolved) also has Vpu, and chimps have tetherin, but Vpu is not a tetherin antagonist in chimps. SIV uses a protein called Nef in that role. 

&amp;nbsp;

Furthermore, you can put the SIVcpz Vpu gene in HIV-1, and it is unable to overcome tetherin when it infects human cells. 

&amp;nbsp;

Based on phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis, HIV-1 crossed from chimps into humans somewhere around 1930, give or take a decade or so. In order for that to occur, Vpu in the viruses that became HIV-1 had to have acquired the changes required to overcome human tetherin. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let's be clear about what happened here: A protein in the ancestral virus to HIV-1 had to accumulate a sufficient number of changes to acquire a new function, without losing it's old function, before there would have been selection for that new function. And this all happened within the observable past, since HIV-1 is, at most, about a century old. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is a textbook case of new information appearing through not only natural processes, but *non-selective* processes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Creationists, we're going to stop claiming this can't happen, right? Right.

There are many different types, but I am taking about the mosquitoes people think about, that have the following characteristics:

-The females draw blood only, and do it to aid reproduction.    
-This suggest that there are little alternative uses for this, otherwise males would also do it, as well as non pregnant females.    
-Without another use for evolution to co-opt from, the following things would need to evolve simultaneously. (1) the apparatus to extract blood; (2) the behaviour (which is hard wired) to find suitable hosts to extract blood; (3) The digestive and reproductive systems that can take advantage this blood.    


This (and other cases of behaviour needing to evolve such as spider webs), seems a pretty strong argument in favour of irreducible complexity that cooption can't explain. Any thoughts from evolutionists?


On the other hand I would like to see what those who disagree with evolution thinks of this (I know this may not strictly be the right sub, but I think it provides an interesting challenge against intelligent design and therefore is related). Why would an intelligent designer, design hard wired behaviour that mess up their other creations?

I transcribed it, so typos, emphasis, and readability edits are mine.

&gt; So these and other reasons are why secular evolutionists are abandoning Neo-Darwinism. Now in addition, what you find is that there's positive evidence for design in nature. What happens is a body plan is controlled by DNA, and DNA is kind of like the digital code in a computer. It has information, and **information is only the product of a mind.** You **can't evolve information except for very, very small amounts.** So you look at these major transitions, that tells you that you have huge amounts of new information being injected into your genome, but information can only be produced by a mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Now an analogy would be like alphabet soup. So, if you ever played with alphabet soup, you kinda stir it and you hope to see a word like “cat”, but there is no way you can stir your alphabet soup or boil it and get, let’s say, the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. You can't get that because the chemistry of the pasta, or the physics of the boiling water. **Highly specific arrangements of letters for a given purpose, like to convey a message, can only be done through intelligence.** Well if you look at the DNA and the information in the cell, that also can only be explained by intelligence.

Instead of rehashing what he said, I will let him speak for himself (lightly edited for readability). Typos and emphasis are mine.

I've broken his talk into 3 parts, and this is part 1.

&gt; And what we see now is that the evidence for Neo-Darwinism is in a lot of trouble. In fact, I'm about to go to a conference in London, that's a secular conference, and one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the world, the Royal Scientific Society
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; But what's happened now is even secular scientists are realizing that Neo-Darwinism doesn't make sense, and there are several reasons for that.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the problems is the fossil record. When you look at the fossils, what you see is that **anything really novel and new appears suddenly and you don’t see series of ancestors leading back to some more primitive form.** So you don't see series of ancestors going from, let’s say, an amphibian to a fish, or linking the large phyla together, what you see instead is that, for instance, the Cambrian explosion, where about 530 to 50 million years ago, you see the sudden appearance of all the major body plans we know today, so the first time you see something like a clam, or a starfish, or a fish, it **appears very suddenly** in the fossil record, without a series of ancestors going back to an evolutionary tree.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, what you find is when you hear the term “transitional fossil”, that means something very different from what people think it means. **What you don't have are true transitions.** A true transition is you have an ancestor, a transition, and then a descendant. That's not what a transition is. A transition, like Archaeopteryx, like Lucy, like Therapsids, they’re more like toaster ovens. What you see are species which are typically well within a given group that share features of another group. So it’s like a toaster oven. A toaster oven has features of both a toaster and an oven, but a toaster oven is not halfway between a toaster and an oven. **What you see in the fossil record is that anything new appears suddenly, and then it does not change beyond very small microevolutionary changes.**
&gt; 
&gt; So the fossil record is a huge, huge problem, and top paleontologists know it. What evolutionists often say to the public is very different from what they say among themselves. Also what you find is top tier evolutionists who are at the cutting edge of the research know things that don't necessarily filter down to second tier universities. That's part of the problem.",11,1479558445,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/5ds8jl/dr_brian_miller_of_the_discovery_institute_three/

&gt; A second issue is when you look at, what does it take to form a body plan? Like, what's the difference between a clam, and a sea urchin, and, let's say, a jelly fish? That basic body plan, whether it's a radial structure, whether it's bilateral, whether it has a nerve cord on the top or the bottom, those large scale architectural differences are formed in development. So you have an egg which starts to form new cells which become an embryo which becomes an adult.
&gt; 
&gt; That's called development, and the basic body plan is set up in development. So you have what are called developmental genes, and what happens is world class researchers that have studied these developmental pathways have recognized that any mutation which alters that developmental pathway which changes the basic body plan is harmful. From observation, from theory, you can't change a body plan through random mutations.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what people realized is evolution is true in a very small sense. So evolution can create a dark moth versus a light moth, you can have natural selection which causes a finch beak to become thicker or thinner, but you cannot explain major body plan changes through microevolution. That's what top secular scientists are saying. That's a huge problem.
&gt; 
&gt; So these and other reasons are why secular evolutionists are abandoning Neo-Darwinism.

And it did not take as long as I expected to add bonobo, as well as update all the files to the latest assemblies. 

The experiment had interesting results. There are clearly prominent bands we share with bonobos, not even found in chimps or others. A smaller number of banding regions better match a chimp, but all in all it looks to me like the origin of at least our Chromosome 2 is more bonobo than chimp. To judge for yourself here's the data:

&gt; In fact, there is an infinity of possible Codon distributions, that all fulfill the rule and, yet, are all different from each other.
&gt; This is easy to show. There are 64 different [three letter] Codons.
&gt; They can be divided into 2 groups where the members of one group are the reverse complements of the members of the other.
&gt; For example, one such division could consist of the following groups.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1439-atp-synthase

A critically important macromolecule—arguably “second in importance only to DNA”—is ATP. ATP is an abbreviation for adenosine triphosphate, a complex molecule that contains the nucleoside adenosine and a tail consisting of three phosphates. As far as known, all organisms from the simplest bacteria to humans use ATP as their primary energy currency. In each of the approximately one hundred trillion human cells is about one billion ATP molecules.
Without ATP, life as we understand it could not exist. All the books in the largest library in the world may not be able to contain the information needed to understand and construct the estimated 100,000 complex macromolecule machines used in humans.  Anything less than an entire ATP molecule will not function and a manufacturing plant which is less then complete cannot produce a functioning ATP. Dr. Jerry Bergman
New X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the working of adenosine triphosphate synthase, the basis of energy transport in all living organisms.
ATP captures the chemical energy released by the combustion of nutrients and transfers it to reactions that require energy, e.g. the building up of cell components, muscle contraction, transmission of nerve messages and many other functions. ATP synthase molecules located within mitochondria stick out on the mitochondria, attached to their inner surfaces in mushroom-like clusters. When food is broken down or metabolized for energy, the last stages of the process occur within the mitochondria.


ATP synthase is an irreducibly complex motor—a proton-driven motor divided into rotor and stator portions. Protons can flow freely through the CF0 complex without the CF1 complex, so that if it would have emerged first, a pH gradient could not have been established within the thylakoids. The δ and critical χ protein subunits of the CF1 complex are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into the chloroplast in everything from Chlorella to Eugenia in the plant kingdom.  All of the parts must be shipped to the right location, and all must be the right size and shape, down to the very tiniest detail. Using a factory assembly line as an analogy, after all the otherwise useless and meaningless parts have been manufactured in different locations and shipped in to a central location, they are then assembled, and, if all goes as intended, they fit together perfectly to produce something useful. But the whole process has been carefully designed to function in that way. The whole complex must be manufactured and assembled in just one certain way, or nothing works at all. Since nothing works until everything works, there is no series of intermediates that natural selection could have followed gently up the back slope of mount impossible. The little proton-driven motor known as ATP synthase consists of eight different subunits, totalling more than 20 polypeptide* chains, and is an order of magnitude smaller than the bacterial flagellar motor, which is equally impossible for proponents of evolution to explain.  10


ATP synthatse is a irreducible complex molecular motor par excelence. Disconnect one of its components, disturb one of its forms, replace some of your AA position,  and the system loses function altogether. Try to build it slowly, step by step, by mindless unguided processes, where would  the energy come from to build it, if it is the energy provider of life? Remember though that the energy that produces ATP synthase is essential to life, virtually for all forms of life. And unless the proton gradient is in place, ATPsynthase would be useless. 

“Various forms of this ingenious device are found in all forms of life.”[size=11]2[/size]

Thus, your statement, “But some anaerobic bacteria do not contain the enzyme ATP synthase” is apparently incorrect. If any bacterium is discovered without it, I would like to know about it.

In sum, all life depends on ATPase, but not all life depends on it for ATP production. Anaerobic bacteria use it to maintain pH balance instead. So ATPase must have been present in the very first cell. No known natural process could have built it up piece-by-piece, as you have suggested, because without the entire apparatus, there is no living cell and therefore no evolution, even in theory.

Since evolution by natural selection requires reproduction, and since reproduction requires life, which requires ATPase, the enzyme is therefore a prerequisite for evolution. But with evolution out of order until ATPase ‘appears’, evolution is not even in the running as a model to explain the origin of the molecular motor.

Each of the below mentioned parts are ESSENTIAL and IRREDUCIBLE. Take away one , and ATP synthase ceases to function. Neither could any of the sub parts simply be co-opted from anywhere else. That would be the same as to say, in order to make a motor function, and a cylinder is missing, go search and find any cylinder nearby , co-opt it, and solved is the problem. The thing is that cylinders come in all size, specification, materials etc. And there is no goal oriented search of parts that fit through evolution Evolution has no forsight. Furthermore, there must be the information how and when and where to mount the parts, at the exact place, in the right sequence.  Thats a far fetch for a mindless  tinkerer to be able to achieve. 

1.The nucleotide binding stator subunits (“cylinders”) :  The electrostatic interaction of these rotor and stator charges is essential for torque generation
2.The central stalk (“crankshaft”) : The torsional elasticity of the central stalk and the bending and stretching elasticity of the peripheral stalk create an elastic coupling between Fo and F1. Is is essential.
3, The A/V rotor subunit (“adapter”) ; It is not used in all ATP synthase motors, and can therefore be reduced.
4. The Rotor ring (“turbine”) ;  A ring of 8–15 identical c-subunits is essential for ion-translocation by the rotary electromotor of the ubiquitous FOF1-
ATPase.
5.The Jon channel forming subunit ; Subunit a harbors the ion channel that provides access to the binding site on the c11 ring in the middle of the membrane from the periplasmic surface . The channel is essential for the operation of the enzyme, because mutants in which the channel is blocked are completely inactive in both the ATP synthesis and/or coupled ATP hydrolysis mode
6. The peripheral stalk (“pushrod”) ; The peripheral stalk of F-ATPases is an essential component of these enzymes. It extends from the membrane distal point of the F1 catalytic domain along the surface of the F1 domain with subunit a in the membrane domain.

As you may know, I'm a computer designer by training and occupation, so my penchant is to examine the creation/evolution issue from the perspective of the implications of the information content of DNA.

DNA is in essence an [information space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_space). It is truly a huge information space. The [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome) comprises 3 billion [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair), each of which contains two [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit), for a total of 6 billion bits (6 gigabits) of information. In information space terms, it is a space of 6 billion [dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension). It can contain the [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) of any living creature with a genome no larger than ours--in fact it can contain *any possible creature's* genome of that size. Nevertheless, all of those possibilities occupy only a minuscule fraction of the total information space, and almost all of the [loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(mathematics\)) in that space represent nonviable genomes. The problem for evolution proponents, who claim that all the diversity that we see in the realm of life ""evolved"" from a single original cell by a process of random mutations sorted by natural selection, is the vastness of the information space and the tininess of the amount of that space occupied by genomes of viable organisms. As is typical for real information space implementations, the loci occupied by viable genomes appear to form innumerable clusters that are separated from one another by vast distances. This does not allow for traversal of the information space via random mutations from cluster to cluster. Rather, to permit evolution by random mutations and selection, it is necessary for all genomes that have ever existed to form continuous strings of near-contiguous loci, so that mutations can jump from locus to locus. Since this is universally not the case for other information spaces and does not appear to be the case for the DNA information space, it is incumbent upon the proponents of evolution to demonstrate that it is possible to traverse the information space from the genome of the very first protocell to the genomes of *every other life form* that now or ever existed, a truly Sampsonian task.

By default and until demonstrated otherwise, we should assume that the DNA information space is configured in a clustered fashion similar to other information spaces, and thus common-descent evolution is not a reasonable possibility.

---

Now I would like to present the results of an analysis I have been conducting on information spaces containing English words. 

[This image](http://imgur.com/a/QPa73) displays the results of a compilation of 172,880 words in a comprehensive list of English words. It simply lists the number of words in the list that are of each specific length. 

* Column **A** specifies the word lengths
* Column **B** reports the number of words of that length in column A
* Column **C** is a running total of the words that are shorter than or equal in length to the word length in column A
* Column **D** is the size of the information space of all words shorter than or equal to the word length in column A (specifically, it is 26^(A))
* Column **E** is the fraction C/D, which denotes the fraction of the information space occupied by actual words
* Column **F** is the first word of the length in column A encountered alphabetically
* Column **G** is the last word of the length in column A encountered alphabetically

Two things to notice:

* The first thing to notice is that the address space grows very quickly (exponentially, in fact) as the number of permitted letters in the word increases. For a word length of one, the address space permits a possible 26 words, specifically ""A"" through ""Z"". For two-letter words, the address space is 26^(2) = 676 words (column **B**), or, if we include the 26 one-letter words, the space accommodates 676 + 26 = 702 words (column **C**). But the address space for the largest word in the word list, having 28 characters, is 26^(28) = 4,161,536,836,220,038,342,098,551,818,958,563,878,766 words.
* The second thing to notice is that the number of actual words that occupy this address space, 172,880, may seem large when considered alone, but when considered in relation to the vast size of the address space, it is tiny beyond comprehension. For single-letter words, there are only two words, ""A"" and ""I"", situated in an address space that can accommodate 26 words, so 7.7% of the space is utilized. For two-letter words, 99 slots are taken in a space of 676 slots, for an occupancy rate of 14.9%. After this, the occupancy rate drops precipitously, until the occupancy rate for a 28-letter address space is an incomprehensible 4 * 10^(-35).

It is normal, both in word spaces and the DNA space, for there to exist clusters of functional loci. In the English word space, these clusters are the result of related words that have a common base—for example, words based on the Latin ""spectō"" (watch): spectator, spectators, spectate, spectated, spectates, spectacle, spectacles, bespectacled, respect, inspect, inspects, inspected, inspector, inspectors, aspect, aspects, expect, expects, expected, etc. Likewise, the DNA space will have clusters of related genes serving related functions in diverse life forms—for example, since every living organism requires the ribosome, there will be closely related genes for all the ribosome proteins and RNA strings, all clustered closely together in the DNA information space. These will be similar but not identical across the diverse forms of life. In addition, when mutations throughout a life form's history produce variants that are still viable, these also will be present in the ""ribosome cluster"".

But it is also normal, both in word spaces and in the DNA space, for there to be clusters that are inaccessible from other clusters by random mutations, because the clusters are separated by vast distances of nonsense loci that are not navigable by random mutations that can be realistically expected to occur. In the English word space, I found that there were clusters of words that could not be accessed by less than six simultaneous fortuitous mutations—one-third to one-half the words' lengths! And the situation could be expected to be worse in the extreme for the DNA space. The English word space is 28 characters, which, at (log_base_2(28) = 4.8 bits) per letter * 28 letters is a mere 135 bits, the human DNA space is a whopping 6 *billion* bits (okay, if you want to say that only 1% of human DNA is functional, then that number shrinks to a tiny 60 million bits). It would be reasonable to expect that the clusters of functional DNA would be isolated from one another by distances across trackless nonsense loci that lack proper superlatives to describe. Now, this may not be the case; perhaps DNA is somehow different from all other address spaces we know of. But it is reasonable to begin with the assumption that the DNA space is not an exception until demonstrated otherwise. Please demonstrate otherwise, or else accept that this is a fatal flaw in the notion of common-descent evolution.

The simplest things. Like: Why do we get nervous(before exams, holding a presentation and the like)? It is super random if you think about it from a creationist perspective. It has no use at all and just makes you feel bad. Well it is part of the ""fight or flight"" response wich is totally useless for an exam as you are not runing around.

If we take it to the extreme and look how heavy drugs can fuck up some people for their entire live because they suffer paranoia and totally change their character. Wouldn't a soul be resistent to this?

Or people with ASPD. Those who are not born with it most of the time experienced a traumatizing childhood. Something happens in their development and now they become these weird people. I bet if you wanted, you could ""grow"" ASPD people on purpose wich seems to me like control over a human character that shouldn't happen with a soul that is made by god.

Even just instincts like wanting to have sex or eat. We are so animal like. Seriously I bet not even 50% of all christian males abstain from masturbation. Why the fuck did god make it so hard to just not want to jerk off? We have so little control.

In sexual reproduction, for complex species (let's narrow it down to mammals), there would seem to be a small window for genetic change (not variation, like available coloration or size) to be passed on to offspring. Not having college level instruction in reproductive biology, I presume the ovaries and tesicles are the only organs contributing half the genome into gametes. 

So, how do the genetic changes become incorporated into the reproductive organs? I can only imagine that a beneficial change would have to occur in the gametes or rather quickly in the embryonic stage. If a change occurs in a developed body, I can't envision how it would become part of the reproductive organ's supply of (gamete creating) DNA. 

I may have missed the memo, but is that how it is supposed to occur? Totally in vitro? That would seem to relegate any speciation changes to mutation exclusively. Adaptation would still play a role in changing environments, based on available variations (like humans and dogs have many variants) but that would relagate permant/species change be exclusively by in vitro mutation.

Headlines such as “humans and chimps are 99% genetically similar”, “Almost Human: New Human Ancestor found”, “Common Ancestry confirmed by new experiment”, mislead the public into thinking Darwinian evolution is based on indisputable evidence, backed by a consensus amongst biologists. If anything, they are just filling in the details and fine tuning the Darwinian mechanism.

People claim that evolution is unreliable because science is never certain and thus they view evolution as not being totally valid as said here:

No theory is 100% complete. We just have what philosophers call ""the inference to the best explanation"". Pick any basic book on the philosophy of science. And I repeat, statistical confirmation just proves my - and the majority of scientists and the philosophers of science - point, which is: it can change, it's not 100%, but it would be ridiculous to deny the best that we currently have. Also, and with respect, if you can find a single academic that claims Darwinism is 100% complete, I'll eat my ""hat"" 
However, the point is that Darwinian evolution is not certain. The podcast briefly introduces some aspects of the philosophy of science.

This article is a first response to /u/VestigialPseudogene's gracious offer to consider suspending the MN presupposition, as made in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/58jixn/my_view_on_stereotypes_and_this_sub/d90wuwa/).

As I pointed out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4n8wv3/methodological_naturalism_is_an_unfounded/?ref=search_posts) article, I am not proposing that things that science can't currently explain be attributed to supernatural causes; there must be good reason to conclude supernatural causation over the natural. And, also stressed in that article, any attribution to supernatural cause should be considered tentative, pending further discoveries, as is always the case in science. This second point removes any concern that such conclusions become dogmatic and irreversible.

As I laid out in [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/52x7bd/how_does_the_addition_of_even_the_possibility_of/?ref=search_posts), I think that there is a compelling philosophical reason to leave open the possibility of extra- or super-natural causation: every time that we attempt to construct a *closed* system, we encounter inconsistencies caused by [self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference). This has occurred multiple times in mathematics:

* When logical statements reference themselves, the result can be nonsense. The statement ""This statement is false"" is false if it is true, and true if it is false. It is therefore nonsense. Similarly, but not so obviously, the statement ""This statement is true"" is nonsense, because it can be either true or false. The problem: self-reference (however, not all self-referencing statements are nonsense, as can be seen in Godel's theorems).

* In set theory, it is necessary to carefully define when and how sets can contain themselves as members. A first attempt at this, called ""[naive set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intuitive_set_theory)"", defines a set as ""any collection of objects or thinkable ideas"". Of course the set itself is a thinkable idea, so this is a case of self-reference, and leads to [Russel's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).

* Kurt Gödel's [incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) *proved* that any formal [axiomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system) system containing [basic arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic), such as ours, is either inconsistent or incomplete. We choose to consider it consistent, so it is therefore incomplete, i.e., there exist true assertions that can never be proven, and thus must be accepted on some other basis. Ironically, these assertions have been called ""supernatural"" theorems.

---

I propose that we consider supernatural causation in at least three circumstances:

* **Necessarily Extra-Natural Causation**. There is at least one event that *cannot* have a natural cause: the beginning of nature (the universe and time-space itself). At one time, it was generally held in the secular science community that time was eternal, and there was considerable resistance to acceptance of the notion that time had a beginning—it sounded too much like a capitulation to the position that Christians have adamantly maintained on the basis of the first sentence of the Bible. But the evidence is overwhelming that the universe indeed had a beginning. Even those unwilling to accept a God-based interpretation are nevertheless compelled to admit to the extra-natural many-worlds interpretation.

* **Prediction**. If a prediction is sufficiently unlikely and yet is fulfilled, it violates our laws of probability. Of course, there are some caveats that must be considered. When a meteorologist makes a weather prediction that is fulfilled, that prediction can be very unlikely from our perspective (insufficient data or computing power), but not from the meteorologist's. Also, ""self-fulfillment"" must be ruled out. Now, most Biblical predictions, or ""prophesies"", are unconvincing to the skeptic for a host of reasons: vagueness, shrouded in uncertain history, self-fulfillment, etc.; however, I claim that many objections fall apart under close examination. But I think that there is an outstanding example that is extremely difficult to refute: the Jewish return to their homeland, over two millennia after the prediction. I laid out the basics of this prophesy [here](), but there is much more to be said, and I suggest we leave that for another time.

* **Information-Theory-Based**. Like the prediction-based argument, this class of arguments is generally based on probability, and includes ID theory, irreducible complexity, and arguments I have posted that are based on the vastness of DNA's [information space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_space) and the sparseness of its population, making mutation/selection-based evolution effectively impossible.

The concept of 'Fine Tuning' is that the constants that describe the physical universe are so exact that if their values were to vary even by the smallest amount then the universe could not exist. Therefore there has to be an intelligence behind the generation of these constants as they could not happen naturally.  This means that, for example,  'C' which is a physical constant that is used in various explanations that describe the observable universe is not just some random value but is was specifically set by an intelligence as a controlling factor of our universe.  It is part of the basic fabric of our universe and as such is set to a precise value that cannot change for if it did the universe would no longer be able to exist let alone be created.

So how is this 'Fine Tuning' a problem for Young Earth Creationist (YEC). Well for starters YEC have a speed of light problem.  You see there are several readily observable astronomical sights that demonstrate that both the Universe and the Earth are both many orders of magnitude older than the YEC accept as calculated using the Bible.

Now when YEC are presented with these astronomical findings their answer is always along the lines of the the speed of light has changed over time.  However, the speed of light is directly related one to one with the physical constant 'C'.  A physical constant that, according to the creationist Fine Tuning argument, is a set value in order to permit the universe to exist. If the speed of light changes, then the physical constant 'C' must change and if the physical constant 'C' changes then according to Fine Tuning the universe will cease to exist.

Part 1.","FThe reason creationism fails, other than a total lack of evidence, is because there are only two ways to argue for it: by being misinformed, or to misinform others.

&amp;nbsp;

Seeing as how /u/No-Karma-II likes to cite papers now, he can't be misinformed, and so he must be one who misinforms. This is made perfectly clear by /u/No-Karma-II's citations. Let us examine the first one.

&amp;nbsp;

He said:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Wikipedia defines [error catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_catastrophe) in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism goes extinct:
&gt; ""Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [...] as a result of excessive mutations.""

&amp;nbsp;

But that isn't exactly accurate. I will place brackets around the parts No-Karma-II left out:

&amp;nbsp;

Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [**(often in the context of microorganisms such as viruses)**] as a result of excessive mutations. [**Error catastrophe is something predicted in mathematical models and has also been observed empirically.**]

&amp;nbsp;

Now, why would he leave that part out? Could it be because he already knew that comparing asexually reproducing bacteria and virus's method of propagation to our own is highly flawed? Or could it be, because it was mentioned as being **OBSERVED EMPIRICALLY,** that quoting it in full completely destroys his claim that “ Wikipedia defines error catastrophe in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism goes extinct?”

&amp;nbsp;

Now this is the “definition” No-Karma-II is trying to push on us:
&gt; ""Error catastrophe is the genetic condition in which deleterious mutations are accumulating over successive generations at a rate that is faster than selection can eliminate them.""

&amp;nbsp;

Which is such a vague definition that it defines every single species that exists, because it purposefully(and dishonestly) ignores *equilibrium*.

&amp;nbsp;

“This theorem may be expressed by saying that the frequency of the disorder among the individuals of the population (i.e. the proportion of individuals that manifest the disorder) reaches an equilibrium value (f) when it is equal to the frequency (n) with which new cases manifesting it are arising by mutation in each generation, multiplied by the persistence (p), that is, the average number of generations during which a mutant gene of the given type manifests itself in the population before becoming eliminated by selection.”

&amp;nbsp;

My quote comes from the same paper as No-Karma-II next quote:
&gt; “ it is evident that the natural rate of mutation of man is so high, and his natural rate of reproduction so low, that not a great deal of margin is left for selection [...] if u [the number of mutations per individual per generation] has the minimal value of 0.1 [...] an average reproductive rate of 2.4 children per individual would be necessary [...] without taking any account whatever of all the deaths and failures to reproduce for non-genetic causes”

&amp;nbsp;

This is the least inaccurate quote, the only edits are extra numbers and ends of beginnings of sentences. Now No-Karma-II says “ I could cite many more quotes from the same paper that make it clear that a value for u of 0.5 or more would ensure the extinction of the human race” but that isn't really accurate. If you actually read this 66 long page paper, which I'm sure No-Karma-II didn't, you would find that the authors was talking about how genetics plays a role in more diseases than what doctors of the time(the 1950's) where willing to accept. Muller also noted that the build up of mutations in the population will take a while to matter, “probably not half attained a thousand years from now even if conditions remained constant in the interim,” and even then we are in no danger of extinction:

&amp;nbsp;

“But even if we were quite convinced that humanity would not be content to continue indefinitely along the road to an actual genetic denouement, we should not for that reason feel justified in regarding the matter of mutational load as one of little consequence. Just because a practice will not result in the wiping out of the human race is no reason why we should go to the other extreme, of considering it innocuous or negligible, as some would have us do in the case of radiation as soon as they find that an atomic bomb will not result in a population of monsters.”

&amp;nbsp;

Basically if we start selectively breeding humans now, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble in the future if we don't people will die at the same rate as we did before agriculture and modern medicine. “At the same time, the amount of genetically caused suffering short of extinction will also have become comparable with what it had been originally”

&amp;nbsp;

While Muller was a brilliant man, even winning a Nobel Prize for his research on the effects of x-rays on Drosophila, his paper “Our Load of Mutations” is from 1950, 66 years old. Muller died in 1967, and the human genome wasn't fully sequenced until 2003. Muller also mentioned in this paper:

&amp;nbsp;

“Unless means could be found of lessening the natural mutation rate (a feat that would require the extended maintenance of the germ cells in vitro as a regular procedure)” which is now possible. As of 2001 we have created [geneticallymodified humans](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-43767/Worlds-GM-babies-born.html) and thanks to tools like [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) that will be even easier to do in the future. However, a paper I found might mean that isn't necessary for our survival.

&amp;nbsp;

“A Resolution of the Mutation Load Paradox in Humans” Published in 2012 by by the Genetics Society of America notes that:

&amp;nbsp;

“The evolutionary consequences of deleterious mutations were first studied by J. B. S. Haldane, who showed that the reduction in mean fitness in a diploid organism caused by recurrent semidominant deleterious mutation at a single locus is equal to twice the mutation rate (Haldane 1937). This led H. J. Muller to suggest that each new deleterious mutation ultimately leads to one genetic death, irrespective of the mutation’s fitness effect (Muller 1950).” 

&amp;nbsp;

However, this paper also says: 

&amp;nbsp;

“Our analytical results and simulations suggest a resolution of the mutation load paradox by showing that a very high number of deleterious mutations can be eliminated from the population each generation and that the population can still be viable. Our results also demonstrate that one mutation does not necessarily result in one genetic death.”

&amp;nbsp;

If, unlike Muller, you take into consideration the extent to which every individual mutation is deleterious, you can show that individual fitness plays a large role in how many mutations can be passed along without causing an error catastrophe, and:

&amp;nbsp;

“We have shown that the proportion of individuals that fail to have descendants in the next generation under a relative fitness model is substantially lower than that predicted under an absolute viability fitness model and that species could potentially survive a mutation rate of 10’s if not 100’s of deleterious mutations per genome per generation if selection was largely mediated through competition.”

&amp;nbsp;

Meaning that the “Thus if U^t has the minimal value of  0.1(n^t = 0.18)” quote used by /u/No-Karma-II is outdated and doesn't matter.

&amp;nbsp;

No-Karma-II says this about the next citation, “The Cost of Natural Selection”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; “As early as 1957, J.B.S. Haldane pointed out in his paper3 that selection has a reproductive cost that must be paid. The cost is paid in the form of reproductive excess that dies in order to meet certain requirements. Several requirements are identified: (1) mutation; (2) segregation; (3) balancing; (4) substitution; and of course (5) random. Mutation deaths are the 3 that concern us here. Any modification in the genome by mutation, whether it be beneficial or deleterious, exacts a cost. The beneficial mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do not* inherit the mutation in order to achieve ""fixation"" of the mutation, and conversely, deleterious mutations require the deaths of the offspring that do inherit the mutation. The deaths need not be in the first generation, and usually are not, but the deaths must eventually occur.”

&amp;nbsp;

Karma says more but the entire mention of the paper in his post is pointless, actually the summary of the paper contradicts his claim that mutations(especially the VSDMs on which natural selection can't select against because their effect is so weak) would build up and cause an error catastrophe, because the more mutations there are, the longer it would take for any one of them spread far enough to influence the survival rate of the population as a whole. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Unless selection is very intense, the number of deaths needed to secure the substitution, by natural selection, of one gene for another at a locus, is independent of the intensity of selection. It is often about 30 times the number of organisms in a generation. It is suggested that, in horotelic evolution, the mean time taken for each gene substitution is about 300 generation. This accords with the observed slowness of evolution.”

&amp;nbsp;

I am unable to get a hold of a copy from which is next citation originates.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; One surprising thing I learned in researching this article is the reason why non-coding DNA was immediately termed ""junk"": it was necessary for it to be useless because if it was, then the effects of deleterious mutations would be more manageable. By declaring 99% of the genome that is non-coding to be ""junk"", the target size for deleterious mutations was reduced 100-fold:

&gt; ""we believe the conclusion is inevitable that in the human genome, nucleotide substitution has an appreciable effect on fitness in only a small fraction of DNA sites, possibly less than 1% of the total.""

&amp;nbsp;

But, this claim is dubious at best, because his citation “Theoretical Aspects of Population Genetics,” is a 232 page book that costs between ~$10 and $70. I seriously doubt No-Karma-II researched this personally, which would make his claim plagiarism, based on the size of this source and the fact that only small snippets can be found for free. The quote he uses, which isn't available for viewing, doesn't even start at the beginning of a sentence. Due to the inability to verify the context of this quote, it must be thrown out.

&amp;nbsp;

His next two citations come from the same paper, “THE RELATION OF RECOMBINATION TO MUTATIONAL ADVANCE” also by Muller:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that [...] lines become more heavily loaded with mutation.""

and

&gt; ""There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.), but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis [...] although deserving of it.""

&amp;nbsp;

Now there are a few problems with these quotes. First problem is the first quote he lists is from page 7, and the second quote is from page 6. There is also the mater of the first quote being taken from the middle of a sentence, and having missing section in the middle of the quote. Let's take a look at his quotes in context, his quote will be italicized and the unquoted parts will be bold to contrast: 

**Our table has shown that, as the degree of advantage conferred by mutant genes diminishes, the rate of accumulation of the given genes is retarded in asexual species but not (over the long term) in sexual ones, so that it is these small mutations which give the greatest differential between the rates of sexual and asexual species.** *There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.) but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis* [**or other investigation,**] *although deserving of it.* **At any rate, below this level accumulation would falter and cease, no matter what the type of reproduction.**

&amp;nbsp;

The next quote, in context, in the same format:

&amp;nbsp;

**Nevertheless, the culling out is done in a less flexible manner in the asexual than in the sexual population, and is correspondingly more subject to maladjustments. If we disregard advantageous mutations, including those of reverse and suppressor types, and concentrate our attention on the effects of selection, we find that** *an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that* [**it can never get to contain, in any of its lines, a load of mutations smaller than that already existing in its at present least-loaded lines. However, the latter**] *lines* [**can (in some of their branches, at any rate)**] *become more heavily loaded* ~~by~~ with *mutation.* **It would be of interest to attempt calculations and experiments on the possible long-term effect of this ratchet mechanism on the populational load. In a recombining population, on the other hand, the application of more rigorous selection can result, in the course of generations, in an actual lessening of the mutational load. This would apply not only to individuals which represent population averages in respect to load but even to those least heavily encumbered. In fact, the load of the population could, theoretically, be caused to approach zero, although the operation would not be a practicable one.**

&amp;nbsp;

This quote is literally the end of the paper, and No-Karma-II absolutely misconstrues everything it says, what little of it he quoted. He leaves out some very important information, like that different lines can have different mutational loads. More importantly he leaves out the fact that in species that use recombination, such as humans(and all other sexually reproducing species) that in time recombination can actually **lessen** the mutational load! He has literally lied about how Muller's wrench works. As I have said, there are only two kinds of creationists, those who are misinformed, and those who do the misinforming. Now, so far we have only covered 5 of his 14 citations. Unfortunately this means I will have to make a few more of these posts, but so far it should be obvious that when it comes to science, creationism fails every time.

Regarding the stereotypes of creationists:

* Tightly correlated and tightly knit with religious fundamentalism/literalism

* Still using the same arguments since several decades. *(I have not been able to find a new sounding argument, just some arguments which are very clear variations of old arguments)*

* Not being experts in the field of biology *(I guess it should be possible to find them though, it's just very clear that we are looking at an awkward minority)*




&amp;nbsp;

All in all, the last couple of months seem to have been incredibly productive, congratulations. I have gone trough the submissions and tried to find creationists with novel/innovative arguments but so far it has been devastating:

* Accusations that the whole understanding of biology is wrong because of some kind of naturalism thing. (still don't get it)

* C^14 dating for fossils (This one is definitely decades old even though it should have died out decades ago)

* Baseless accusation of a whole scientific field for intentional/unintentional fraud, usually from an amateur

* People claiming all of DNA has function, again never backed up by much, ENCODE being the only thing coming near to it

* Irreducible complexity again and again, with biologists having the standard answer that we already have several examples that looked irreducible and then weren't anymore.

* Several cases of argument from ignorance: This and that looks to complex, this and that is too beautiful. Not really that convincing and also as old as the cold war, probably more.

* In the same vein, the ID argument, also pretty old and not new: This and that look to complex, therefore, without a shred of evidence, we can *infer* a designer.

* ToE is not falsifiable. Probably so old that people could copy paste answers for this.

That was just last week, we go deeper into the months:

* Error catastrophe. Sounds like a new argument at first, however it's the old ""populations are slowly degrading because of mutations"" argument.

* Several dozens of threads about the origin of life. Basically poking holes into something that is a hypothesis anyway. Again pretty popular and Hitler probably heard of that argument too.

* More about the naturalism thing. Sounds more like complaining than actually productively trying to bring forth an argument

* DNA found in dino fossils

&amp;nbsp;

In my humble observation, I realized that most topics seem to clearly evade the central topics of biology. Could you guys (the biologists etc.) step it up and bring more of them?

For example, I have no idea why you guys are talking so much about naturalism, abiogenesis, ID, dating methods and complexity. This is absolutely *not* central to the ToE.

DebateEvolution,58aosj,RealityIsReal01,,t2_128jzs,self.DebateEvolution,,Falsifiability not a requirement of science,"Karl Popper stated that what separates science from non-science is ""falsifiability"", or ability to empirically show that a theory is false. This might sound simple and reasonable, but in reality, it is very difficult to falsify and know when a theory has been falsified. Historically, theories have not been falsified, only replaced by better theories that have more explanatory and predictive power.

Falsifiability fell out of favor in philosophy of science some time ago. Recently, [many scientists](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/02/falsifiability/) are beginning to [question](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/) the [meaning](http://www.whytrustatheory2015.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of falsifiability. 

Falsifiability is not how science is done in practice. Scientists do not look at their theories in terms of falsifiability. Rather, they try to find evidence to support it. For what they cannot explain, they say they don't know. Practically all non-trivial scientific theories today about the world are unfalsifiable.

The problem is the concept of ""naive falsification"": You don't know if the theory has actually been falsified or the observation is valid and the theory can explain it but you are just ignorant of that fact. 

For example, some say that mammal fossils in the precambrian era would falsify evolution. If they actually found fossils there, would they just throw Darwinism into the dumpster? Ok, and then what? What replaces it? No, in reality and in practice, it would just push back the timeline of divergence. Or it could also mean there was another divergent mammalian branch. Or it could mean the measurement was wrong, a hoax, or alien or time traveling humans. 

Would a failed prediction (there have been many) of Darwinism immediately falsify the theory? No. Why? Because if the theory can explain and predict many observations, then it is scientifically valid. Scientific theories are known for their evidence, explanatory power, and many successful predictions (despite a few failures). 

Scientific theories are not falsified, they are replaced when better theories come.

Kepler's theory of gravity fell out in favor of Newtonian gravity, which then fell out in favor of Einstein's since it was able to predict and explain more. Geocentricism fell out in favor of Heliocentricism since it required less ""epicycles"" and was more simple and elegant. Scientists did not view these theories in terms of ""falsifiability"" but in terms of explanatory power and predictive power. 

Therefore, when certain scientists say Intelligent Design is ""unfalsifiable"", they are being unrealistic and trying to find excuses. Many Darwinist scientists today consider ID to be science (Though a few haven't come out of the closet). The main reason why ID isn't qualified as science is because it has a religious basis. But that isn't anymore invalid than having a materialistic/naturalistic world view, as many Darwinists do. 

**TL; DR:** Scientific theories are not falsified, they are replaced when better theories come.

First I will start with a claim: Humans have lived since the beginning of the Earth (4 billion years ago) and remained virtually unchanged. They just haven't found fossils for early humans yet. 

Explanations: 

- Genetic similarities between species: The designer simply mutated the genetic information to create all species of life all at once. 

- Phylogeny: The relationships between species can be explained through common designer. 

- Molecular clock: It is based on inference of rates of change and then backtracking to match the supposed evolutionary story. Uses a lot of fiddling of computations.

ID states that objects that have complexity, order, information, function, purpose, and machine-like parts can best be explained by design by an intelligent being that has knowledge.

What do humans design? Machines, vehicles, computer programs, robots, etc. All of which display complexity, order, information, function, purpose, and have machine-like parts. 

If we find these same characteristics somewhere in nature, then we can infer that it was designed by an intelligent designer, because knowledge and intelligence is required to create an object that displays these characteristics. Without it, there is only chaos and disorder. 

We do, in fact, find many biological parts inside of cells that meet all these characteristics and resemble inventions humans create. From this, we can infer that these parts were designed. 

A self-replicating robot humans build can potentially turn into a more complex robot down the road. But the original program for replication was designed by an intelligent agent. Likewise, genetic information has its source in knowledge.

DebateEvolution,57ssx4,UnfalsifiableLie,,t2_125w3u,self.DebateEvolution,,Darwinism is not falsifiable,"A believed hallmark of science is falsification. However, falsification only exists on paper and in the philosophy of science. In practice, it is never done, especially for Darwinism, and for many reasons. 

Darwinism is a ""historic"" science, meaning it is concerned primarily with explaining the origin of all species and lifeforms found today and yesterday. Therefore, it uses forensic methodologies to construct a narrative that explains the past. It also means it's much more difficult to falsify evolution than other sciences such as physics and chemistry, since you can't experimentally demonstrate history. 

Darwinism is also very heavily established in the scientific establishment, that many will still cling onto the theory. 

**Falsification is an opinion**

There is no consensus on what evidence is considered to falsify evolution. Who is to define it and how? Some, such as Richard Dawkins, say [precambrian rabbits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian_rabbit) because it would contradict common descent. Others [disagree](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falsifiability_of_evolution#Precambrian_rabbit) and say it wouldn't, for several reasons: one rabbit isn't enough but several might, it only proves time travel or alien rabbits, the fossils may be a hoax, error in measurement, or just ignored, like what happened with [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco) archaeological finding. 

**Falsification may not be known or premature judgement**

Suppose you do make an observation that could falsify a theory. How do you know it's not an error in measurement? Normally you would run several experiments, but this is very difficult in the field of Darwinism for the reasons mentioned and those that will be mentioned. 

More importantly, how do you know it's not due to ignorance that you are unable to explain the observation? For example, if you found precambrian rabbits, maybe it's due to a misunderstanding of the real process of evolution as some have suggested. 

**Falsification standards are made ad hoc and impossible to falsify**

According to [this](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Falsifiability_of_evolution#What_would_falsify_evolution.3F) website, evolution will basically be falsified if it can be shown that genes don't exist, mutations aren't real, and genes aren't passed down. 

However, these standards were created *after* it was shown that all these things are true and after genetics was discovered. 

Charles Darwin stated in his work the idea of irreducible complexity regarding the eye. Darwinism published his work before genetics was discovered, and so his best example of a complex structure was the eye. We now know of many molecular machines, such as the bacterial flagellum, that seriously casts the mechanism of Darwinism, namely random, unguided mutation, into doubt. 

Irreducible complexity is indeed a valid falsification, but notice how the ""rational"" wiki article doesn't mention it in their list.

There is also the possibility of falsification standards being impossible to test, that it is *de facto* unfalsifiable. 

**Too much evidence to be falsified**

There are those who say that evolution has too much evidence that nothing can falsify it. This is contradictory to the meaning of the scientific method and falsification: that scientific conclusions can never be proven, only falsified. This also amounts to nothing more than confirmation bias, since only positive evidence was collected and assessed and everything else was ignored. 

The ""rational"" wiki articles makes that statement.

**Denial, frustration, double standards, emotional attachment, confirmation bias**

Scientists are humans, and despite what they say about being very objective, are actually very much personally and emotionally attached to their theories. It becomes part of their identity. I am a scientist myself (computer scientist), and know many individuals who have said evolution is ""a beautiful theory"", etc. These people's minds can never be changed.

For example, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has officially declared, ""Intelligent design is not a scientific concept because it cannot be empirically tested"" (Science, Evolution, and Creationism (National Academy Press, 2008), p. 42).

However, on page 40 they stated the claims of intelligent design creationists are disproven by the findings of modern biology"" (p. 40). So according to the NAS, ID ""cannot be empirically tested,"" but its claims have been ""disproven by the findings of modern biology."" Surely both statements cannot be true. 

This shows that the scientific establishment cannot properly, and without bias, assess competing scientific theories. 

The ID theory is in fact, scientific, and falsifiable. If it can be shown that complex structures can very likely and consistently be produced through unguided, and random mutations, then there is no need for intelligent foresight. 

**TL; DR / Conclusion**

Darwinism is theoretically falsfiable on paper, but in practice this is not the case. Ad hoc explanations will be given to explain away anomalies or inconsistencies. Darwinism has been elevated to an unquestionable dogma in the scientific establishment.",28,1476642596,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/57ssx4/darwinism_is_not_falsifiable/

[Good example and discussion from the community of /r/evolution (before this sub was created)](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/zrayl/dear_revolution_i_joined_this_subreddit_for_the/)

Summary: People are annoyed by proselytizers an pseudo-scientifics and they feel like the influx of these people are ruining their experience.

&amp;nbsp;

Some time later the creator of this sub chimes in in /r/evolution:

[Link to full thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/1n8omc/i_created_rdebateevolution/)

Summary: This sub was originally created to specifically refer those ""annoying"" individuals to this sub so they can be left in peace.

&amp;nbsp;

As a result, both subs now feature very clear guidelines about which submissions are allowed. From /r/evolution's **Guidelines**:

&gt; &gt; Things we don't like

&gt; ""Debunk this"" posts

&gt; Pseudo-Science and Proselytizing

&gt; The moderators of this sub reserve the right to remove posts or comments that are not in keeping with the guidelines.

/r/biology does not have any clear posting guidelines, but I know from experience that the mods are very trigger happy with creationists who don't create submissions in good faith and honesty.

So basically; be annoying, get removed.

Then regarding this subreddit, [from the words of the sub creator himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4lj690/thinking_like_an_evolutionist/d3of020?context=3):

&gt; Hi, I'm the creator of this sub. I have never made any claim of being ""impartial"", I am 100% pro-science and I will NEVER put liars or cranks like the ones you list in the sidebar.

&amp;nbsp;

So basically, this sub was created as a trash can for other subs. If  you are being annoying in /r/biology or /r/evolution, the mods have an ""excuse"" to kindly refer you to this subreddit.

This should answer the question ""Why aren't *both* sides of the debate included in this subreddit?"" 

Two sides don't exist in this ""debate"" and this sub was *never* supposed to be an impartial sub. This is the answer.

DebateEvolution,57l1dn,No-Karma-II,,t2_ya3uo,self.DebateEvolution,,A Problem With the Many-Worlds Idea,"When two motorists arrive to an all-way stop intersection at 90° to each other at exactly the same time, who gets the right-of-way? I'm sure you all know the answer: in countries where cars drive on the right side of the road, the motorist on the right gets the right-of-way. But you may not be aware that this rule does not solve the problem of right-of-way. In fact, the problem has no closed solution! Regardless of how the rule is worded, there will always be an ambiguous situation—one in which it will be unclear who has the right-of-way. Such a situation is referred to in electronics as a metastable state.

How long does it take for a metastable state to resolve? The answer is it can take an indefinite length of time; there is no upper limit on the time it can take. However, each situation has a property—the metastability time constant^(1)—that tells us how fast the metastable condition will resolve with a certain probability. Two vehicles with computer-controlled automation may resolve the situation in microseconds; two dull humans may take tens of seconds.

Even the sport of basketball can be pestered with this problem, as [this video](https://youtu.be/qwTOG6CGRXI) demonstrates.

Now, why do I mention this phenomenon called metastability? I mention it because the latest research reveals that our universe exhibits behaviors very similar to the phenomenon of metastability. We are like that basketball, precariously balanced on the rim in the video above. Physicists and astronomers marvel at the fact that a plethora of characteristics are just right for intelligent life like us humans to exist. Some parameters are tuned to an accuracy of one part in 10^(120)! And they exist at multiple levels, from the universe's fundamental constants, to fortuitous ""coincidences"" such as the [triple-alpha resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process#Resonances) that gives us the abundant carbon necessary for life, to the serendipitous qualities of water as the perfect solvent [1](http://www.cemag.us/article/2007/10/water-perfect-solvent-or-poor-solvent),  [2](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/watersol.html).

Scientists and philosophers have to attempt to explain how it could be that our universe would ""just happen"" to be characterized by such wildly improbable parameters and conditions. The most straightforward explanation is simply that its special design was designed by a Designer, which sounds uncomfortably like it belongs in God's wheelhouse. Heaven forbid! We must find another explanation!

And so they did. It's called the [many worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation), in which there exists an infinitude of universes of all manner of fundamental parameters and characteristics. At every instant, each of the infinitude of universes splits into yet another infinitude of possible paths forward in time. However, only the ones that have the ""Goldilocks"" just-right characteristics that permit intelligent life to evolve will be observed, because only they will possess observers! The astute observer will note that these other supposed universes are definitionally undetectable, and thus are super- or extra-natural, and so are excluded from science by the BDMNP. But that does not stop scientists from embracing the many-worlds interpretation. But why would they prefer the supernatural many-worlds interpretation to the supernatural God interpretation? I suggest it's because the former has none of the baggage that accompanies the God idea: moral obligation and all that stuff.

Anyhow, back in the '70's, a curious phenomenon I noticed while performing checkout on the [CDC Cyber-203](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_Cyber#Cyber_200_series) computer one night caught my eye. I was tracking down an intermittent error, the worst kind to isolate. After hours of chasing, I found myself looking at the culprit metastable signal on an oscilloscope, produced because a signal path was too long from one clocked register to the next and so the signal was ""slicing the clock"". But when I triggered the 'scope on the metastable signal, I noticed that as I adjusted the delay on the trigger, the failing signal would move with the trigger and simply fade into oblivion.

Let me use the basketball example to explain what I was seeing. Imagine that we have a player at the free-throw line, shooting hundreds of millions of free-throws, one at a time, and you are an observer who has been tasked with reporting whether each free-throw attempt was successful. However, after a few hundred free-throws you get bored and decide to build a machine to automatically record the outcome of each attempt. Your machine has a switch that will be activated if the ball goes through the hoop, and others that are activated if the ball falls anywhere outside the hoop. You decide on a reasonable time to wait for the ball to complete its journey; let's say you give it 3 seconds from the toss. But you find a complication: every few hundred free-throws, none of the switches are activated. Undaunted, you set up a video camera to photograph what happens in those instances. You discover the situation in the above video: the ball balances on the hoop, and right as the video is triggered, the ball is falling down, either in the hoop or outside. Well, you say, it always resolves right as the video begins, so all I need to do is wait an extra second before recording the result. Upon waiting 4 seconds instead of 3, you see far fewer failures; nevertheless, you still see a rare case where no switch is triggered. The video camera results look just the same as before: right as the video is triggered, the ball is falling down, either in the hoop or outside. So you set the delay to 5 seconds. The failures get rarer, but the video camera results still look exactly the same!

What is happening? It's that, although the metastable situation can take any amount of time to resolve, the *likelihood* of it taking a long time is much smaller than the likelihood of it taking a short time. It's an exponentially decreasing function of time. So no matter how much time you give the metastability to resolve, *almost all* of the video shots will record that the metastability is resolving right as the trigger occurs.

So here's the analogy: Each free-throw toss is one of the infinitude of universes in the many-worlds interpretation. The metastability is the fine-tuning of all the many aspects of each universe, and the time that the ball balances on the hoop is the time that each universe is tuned such that it is on the path to evolving towards intelligent life like us. The great, great majority of universes never exhibit any metastability at all. Of those that achieve metastability for, let's say 100 years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Of those that achieve metastability for 1000 years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Of those that achieve metastability for a million years, almost all are crashing and burning as the time expires. Whatever amount of time you select, the vast majority of the universes that achieve that length of metastability time will be on the verge of collapsing, and will be in the process of doing so as they are observed.

So what is our situation? We inhabit one of the universes that manages to hang on until intelligence emerges. Of all the universes that do this, we do not live in a special one; rather, ours is typical of all the universes that survive long enough for observers to begin observing. And what should our eyes behold? We should see the universe disintegrating before our horrified eyes as we, like almost all universes that make it this far, collapse into a fireball. Notice, this should have happened, not now, but back when observers first began observing (whenever that was).

But this did not happen. I don't know how much longer our universe will continue before He decides to close the curtain, but the very facts that it has survived this long, and that it shows no signs of cataclysm just yet, are sufficient to debunk the many-worlds interpretation.

What interpretation does that leave us?

In biological science the definition of an organic species is a group of individual organisms, a population, that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. One species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring.

Now creationists agree that some random changes do occur in the genomes of living organisms do to the fact that DNA reproduction is carried out in a Brownian solution and automatic nature of chemical bonding, and that those gradual changes can effect biological elements within the organism. For example leg length, disease resistance, colouration etc..

So can some creationist biochemist / geneticist with understanding of the process of DNA reproduction please tell me what is the mechanism that prevents gradual change to the genome of a population to such an extent that it can no longer mate with a common ancestor.

[The fossil record for humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils) is fairly well put together at this point, with many transitional fossils of human-like apes that no longer live today.

* They all gradually look different and the fossils match with geography and time. (The analysis of anatomy doesn't require MN)

* They have all extensively, directly and indirectly been dated. The oldest cranium being around 7 Mya. Among the fossils there are more than **60** pretty much fully formed skulls, all between ten thousands of years or millions of years old. (The laws of chemistry and dating methods don't require MN)

So with some very basic science, a tiny bit of logic, and a buttload of math, I will once and for all put an end to his concerns.

&amp;nbsp;

First of all we are chucking all VSDMs (very slightly deleterious) out with window, not even considering them because:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; [VSDMs are usually invisible to selection, since they reside below the ""noise floor"" (see graph).](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/559nry/on_error_catastrophe_reprise_with_documentation/d8el5ii)

&amp;nbsp;

As /u/No-Karma-II pointed out VSDMs basically don't detract from a creature's survival rate, so if it doesn't effect the survival rate it won't/can't lead to an error catastrophe.

&amp;nbsp;

How harmful to species survival are mutations exactly? Well, that depends on where the mutation occurs, the DNA in our body doesn't have quantum entanglement, a change in once cell will only be spread to the cells that descend from that cell. So if I have mutant cells in my lungs, yeah that is bad for me, but my offspring can't inherit those, unless those mutations were present in all of my cells due to a mutation in the germline cells that resulted in my birth. We will come back to this later.

&amp;nbsp;

I cited [this paper](http://www.genetics.org/content/156/1/297) about the estimated mutation rate of the human genome in a reply in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/54ucim/on_error_catastrophe/d871ykx) To summarize humans experience ~175 mutations per generation (a period of 20 years) and of those the *U* (number of deleterious mutations) is 3.

&amp;nbsp;

So the percentage of mutations that are deleterious per generation is only 1.71428571429%. That is a small percent. That number will continue to grow smaller as we consider other factors. As I mentioned the only time these mutations will truly harm the species is if they are passed from parent to offspring. For this to occur the deleterious mutation in question has to happen in a germline cell. According to [this paper here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23829164) there are estimated to be ""3.72 × 10^13"" cells in the human body. That is 37.2 trillion cells. How every, finding the exact number of germiline cells in the male body is basically impossible, it seems like no one has done the research, so, I'm going to pull some math out of my butt, but it will be the best math.

&amp;nbsp;

To help the creationist(statically speaking) I will use the smallest average weight for males that are 20 years of age, so that way germline cells will make up a greater percentage of cells in the body.

&amp;nbsp;

Average 20 year old male weighs 72 kilograms. This is equal to 71287.13 cubic centimeters, and because the metric system is awesome this means the human body is 71287.13 milliliters. A human testicle is typically 15 to 25 ml in volume. To help the creationist I will use larger value of 25ml. So 50ml is 0.070138887622492% of 71287.13 ml. So 0.07% of a male body is germline cells. Well 0.07% of 37.2 trillion cells gives us only 26,040,000,000 male cells in which a mutation matters. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let's help the creationist out and ignore the fact that having all 3 of the harmful mutations occur in only .07% of the cells that matter is basically impossible. Even if all 3 deleterious mutations occurred in only the germline cells of the male body, that is 1.1520737327189 × 10^-8 % of cells carrying the harmful mutations. Now the average ejaculation of a fertile male releases between ~ 200,000,000 500,000,000 sperm. However only 1 sperm can fertilize an egg. So only 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm will fertilize an egg. I'm not even going to bother calculating how small the chances are that the 1.15 × 10^-8 % of deleterious mutation carrying cells will be part of that 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm that will fertilize an egg, but a logical guess tells me it would be pretty damn small.

&amp;nbsp;

Well a generation in the paper I cited is 20 years. I don't know very many people that reproduce within the first 15 years of their life, so only 1/4^th of the mutations will even matter if they occur in the sperm cells themselves. So it is possible that only 2.8801843317972 × 10^-9 % of the sperm could potentially be a part of that 5.0 × 10^-7 % of sperm that will fertilize an egg. Again, I don't have to tell you how small that number would be.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm not saying that that is the statistical chance of passing on a mutation, but that could potential be the lowest chance, if we ignore other factors like is the ejaculation happening during the female ovulation cycle, is birth control being used, is the male even having sex or is he masturbating? All of those could also decrease likelihood of the deleterious mutation being passed on.

&amp;nbsp;

I could do the same math as I did for the testicles with regard to female germline cells, but this would be fallacious. Ovaries aren't testicles. [“Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest are wasted.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary#Ovarian_aging) 

&amp;nbsp;

So in females, even assuming the unlikelihood of all 3 deleterious mutations occurring in only the germline cells, only 0.0003% of those germline cells will contain deleterious mutations, statically speaking. I'm not going to do the math, but the chances that 0.0003% of germline cells carrying deleterious mutations are also part of the 0.05% of germline cells that ovulate is incredibly small.

&amp;nbsp;

I could dig even deeper into the topic and mention how recessive and dominated traits could potentially make the mutation even less likely to matter. I could mention that gametes are haploid, so only half of the cells being created by a mutated gametocytes would even carry that mutation. But, I think the math we have done so far speaks for itself and I can conclude sooner rather than later...

&amp;nbsp;

So, even with giving the creationist the advantage by having all 3 mutations occurring solely in germline cells, and assuming those 3 mutations are in separate germline cells, and making germline cells the largest number possible(in males) we can't get a percentage of deleterious mutations high enough to cause an error catastrophe in the human species. Sorry /u/No-Karma-II but the theory of evolution has nothing to fear when it comes to human mutations.",123,1475930966,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/56gt6g/the_statistical_improbability_of_human_extinction/

So this is a little tangential to the normal fare here, but I thought it might make for a good discussion.

Remember those dinosaur fossils with the soft tissues found a while back? Well the guy running CSU's electron microscopy lab,Mark Armitage, analyzed a Tricertops horn containing soft fibrillar sheets and then published a [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065128113000020) in *Acta Histochemica* claiming it dated to the Biblical flood.

~~He got fired~~ The University elected not to renew his contract and Armitage sued the University claiming he was terminated for his creationist views, they just settled. 

My question here is, was the University in the wrong and should they have settled?

The way I see it, he wasn't let go for being a creationist, he was let go for being a bad scientist and embarrassing the University - and I think the University was justified in doing it. Granted, he's a bad scientist *because* he's a creationist, just like a homeopath is a bad doctor because they're a homeopath.

If he were an economics professor, for example, nobody would care that he was a creationist, it wouldn't compromise his ability to do his job. But he wasn't in the econ department, nor was he publishing long debunked fringe views in economics journals.

Or maybe it was just budgetary considerations like the University claims.

&gt; ""Error catastrophe is the extinction of an organism [...] as a result of excessive mutations.""

In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/54ucim/on_error_catastrophe/) article, /u/DarwinZDF42 (I'm dying to know what ZDF42 means) defines ""error catastrophe"" in such a way that it does not exist until the subject organism is already experiencing population decline:

&gt; ""Error catastrophe is when^(1) the mutation rate is sufficiently high that deleterious mutations accumulate to the point where the average reproductive output, i.e. the average number of viable offspring produced by each member of a population, fall[s] below one, so that over time the number of reproducing individuals in a population shrinks, and eventually that population goes extinct.""

(by the way, these definitions should not be confused with the term as coined by Leslie Orgel in 1963, which is a totally different and obsolete definition)

With your permission, I would like to slightly redefine error catastrophe for the purposes of this article so that it is identified earlier and reflects the original cause of the condition:

&gt; ""Error catastrophe is the genetic condition in which deleterious mutations are accumulating over successive generations at a rate that is faster than selection can eliminate them.""

In other words, error catastrophe occurs when the genome's genetic load is ever-increasing. The organism may still possess reproductive excess that allows it to prosper for many generations without having its population growth rate fall below one, at which point it fits /u/DarwinZDF42's definition. Nevertheless, its doom is sure as soon as its genetic load is irreversibly on the increase.

---

In 1950, H.J. Muller (later creator of ""Muller's Ratchet"") published a paper^(2) that sounded an early alarm regarding the threat that deleterious mutations pose to human survival. Among other scary things, he said:

&gt; ""it is evident that the natural rate of mutation of man is so high, and his natural rate of reproduction so low, that not a great deal of margin is left for selection [...] if **u** [the number of mutations per individual per generation] has the minimal value of 0.1 [...] an average reproductive rate of 2.4 children per individual would be necessary [...] without taking any account whatever of all the deaths and failures to reproduce for non-genetic causes""

Note that Muller is predicting problems when u = 0.1, that is, for every ten offspring, nine inherit NO mutations, and the tenth has ONE! I could cite many more quotes from the same paper that make it clear that a value for u of 0.5 or more would ensure the extinction of the human race.

---

As early as 1957, J.B.S. Haldane pointed out in his paper^(3) that selection has a reproductive cost that must be paid. The cost is paid in the form of reproductive excess that dies in order to meet certain requirements. Several requirements are identified: (1) mutation; (2) segregation; (3) balancing; (4) substitution; and of course (5) random. Mutation deaths are the deaths that concern us here. Any modification in the genome by mutation, whether it be beneficial or deleterious, exacts a cost. The beneficial mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do not* inherit the mutation in order to achieve ""fixation"" of the mutation, and conversely, deleterious mutations require the deaths of the offspring that *do* inherit the mutation. The deaths need not be in the first generation, and usually are not, but the deaths must eventually occur. Note that it does not matter how overt or subtle the phenomic effects are; if the mutation is to be propagated or extinguished, the cost of doing so must be paid (this cost-based analysis led Haldane to conclude that there is not enough reproductive excess in many animals, including man, to pay the costs associated with fixing any realistic number of beneficial mutations necessary for our evolution in the time allotted of several million years, but that is not the thesis of this article). The number of deaths that are required to fix a beneficial mutation is dependent on how fast it is to fix; as an extreme example, if it is to fix in one generation, all other members of the population must die in that generation! Typically, though, fixation occurs over many generations (Haldane estimated 300) and the cost is much lower. For deleterious mutations, the cost can be just one death—the death of the original offspring—or more if it occurs in later generations. In any case, all offspring that inherit the deleterious mutation must die if it is to be extinguished.

---

One surprising thing I learned in researching this article is the reason why non-coding DNA was immediately termed ""junk"": it was necessary for it to be useless because if it was, then the effects of deleterious mutations would be more manageable. By declaring 99% of the genome that is non-coding to be ""junk"", the target size for deleterious mutations was reduced 100-fold:

&gt; ""we believe the conclusion is inevitable that in the human genome, nucleotide substitution has an appreciable effect on fitness in only a small fraction of DNA sites, possibly less than 1% of the total.""^(4)

---

In 1964, H.J. Muller published the paper^(5) for which he is best known, in which he described the mechanism that came to be known as ""Muller's Ratchet"":

&gt; ""an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that [...] lines become more heavily loaded with mutation.""

Muller's Ratchet asserts that deleterious mutations in asexually reproducing organisms, once fixed, cannot be removed, because the genome reproduces as an indivisible unit. In the same paper, he advanced the concept of a ""selection floor"" [my term], stating that there is a minimum absolute value for selection's effectiveness, below which the effect is so subtle that it becomes invisible to selection:

&gt; ""There comes a level of advantage, however, that is too small to be effectively seized upon by selection, its voice being lost in the noise, so to speak. This level would necessarily differ greatly under different circumstances (genetic, ecological, etc.), but this is a subject which has as yet been subjected to little analysis [...] although deserving of it.""

[This image](http://imgur.com/a/H1TG0) illustrates the characteristics of selection as Muller described them. Notice three things:

* There are many more slightly beneficial/deleterious mutations than strongly so;
* Mutations whose effect is smaller than a certain threshold become invisible to selection—they will NEVER be removed. This is akin to a whisper uttered across the hall at a rock concert. Another analogy, illustrating the effects of these VSDMs and how they accumulate, would be rust on a car. Although the individual VSDMs are invisible to selection, their aggregate would be; the problem, though, is that the aggregates are evenly distributed over the general population, so that selection can only choose among many equally ""rusty"" genomes.
* The deleterious mutations greatly outnumber the the beneficial mutations of equal effect. The ratio is commonly said to be 1000:1 or greater.

Muller discussed the action of his ""ratchet"" only as it applied to asexual reproduction, since sexual reproduction can ameliorate its effects through swapping of linkage blocks, which are typically about 20,000 base pairs long. Although reduced in effect, Muller's ratchet still applies to meiosis because all mutations in a linkage block still are treated as a unit. And in any case, Muller's ratchet will express its fullest damaging effect on reproduction of the human mitochondrial DNA, which reproduces via mitosis of the female ovum.

In 1968, Motoo Kimera publishes a paper^(6) with some truly shocking numbers. He says:

&gt; ""in the evolutionary history of mammals, nucleotide substitution has been so fast that, on average, one nucleotide pair has been substituted in the population roughly every two years. This figure is in sharp contrast to Haldane’s well-known estimate [... which states that] a new allele may be substituted in a population every 300 generations""

and

&gt; ""at the rate of one substitution every two years [...] the substitutional load becomes so large that no mammalian species could tolerate it""

which is my working definition of error catastrophe, and

&gt; ""This brings us to the rather surprising conclusion [... that] the mutation rate per generation for neutral mutations amounts to roughly [...] four per zygote""

As we shall see, Kimera was still way low on his estimate of the number of mutations per offspring per generation, but even his low estimate caused him serious concern. In order to digest this disheartening information, he had to conclude that most mutations are neutral and thus hidden to selection. But this ignores the fact that deleterious VSDMs outnumber advantageous VSDMs by at least 1000:1, so these hidden mutations must necessarily be wreaking havoc, not inexorably marching up the hill of complexity.

In 1983, Kimera published^(7) his famous neutral theory. Although mechanisms have since been discovered that could account for neutral evolution, Kimera's impetus for proposing the theory was not so much evidence that it occurs as it was the absolute necessity that it exist to salvage the evolutionary paradigm:

&gt; ""This formula shows that as compared to Haldane’s formula the cost is larger by about 2 [...] under the assumption that the majority of mutation substitutions at the molecular level are carried out by positive selection [...] to maintain the same population number and still carry out mutant substitutions [...] each parent must leave [...] 3.27 million offspring to survive and reproduce. This was the main argument I used when I presented the neutral mutation-random drift hypothesis of molecular evolution.""

Wow! Let that sink in... every parent must leave 3.27 MILLION offspring! This is to prevent error catastrophe. This is why I claim that error catastrophe is a serious danger for higher organisms that exhibit low fecundity; they just don't have the excess offspring to pay the costs of mutation selection.

So the neutral theory is absolutely necessary, whether the evidence confirms it or not, for evolution to be a viable theory. And what would happen if we were to discover that mutations occur at higher rates than four per zygote?

---

In 1986, a scientific paper^(8) DID report significantly higher mutation rates (although later research would find even these to over-optimistically favor evolution):

&gt; ""gamete rates for point mutations [... are] on the order of 30 per generation [...]. The implications of mutations of this magnitude for population genetics and evolutionary theory are profound. The first response of many population geneticists is to suggest that most of these occur in ""silent"" DNA and are of no real biological significance. Unfortunately for that line of reasoning [...] the amount of silent DNA is steadily shrinking. The question of how our species accommodates such mutation rates is central to evolutionary thought.""

So, initial predictions were that the rate of mutation occurrence, **u**, could be no higher than 0.1 for there to be any hope that natural selection could sort and manage them to avoid error catastrophe. Then it grew to 1, 2 and 4, with appropriate accompanying alarm. Meanwhile, the problem is being exacerbated by a shrinking percentage of ""junk"" DNA, making the target for random point mutations grow.

---

Then in 1995 came the paper^(9) that asks the question that every creationist asks: ""Why have we not died 100 times over"", if we've been evolving for millions of years? Some of his comments:

&gt; ""Tachida^([10]) (1990) concluded that VSDMs (very slight deleterious mutations) impairing only one function—its interaction with nucleosomes—may lead to too high a mutation load""

&gt; ""Lande^([11]) (1994) and Lynch^([12]) et al. (1994) [...] concluded [... that] VSDMs can rapidly drive the population to extinction""

&gt; ""Simultaneous selection against many mutations can lead to further decline of Ne and facilitate extinction (Li^([13]) 1987; Lynch^([12]) et al. 1994).""

&gt; ""I interpret the results in terms of the whole genome and show, in agreement with Tachida^([10]) (1990), that VSDMs can cause too high a mutation load, even when Ne = 10^(6)-10^(7) [...] conditions under which the load may be paradoxically high are quite realistic""

&gt; ""the load can become excessive even when U &lt; 1 [...] as my analysis suggests—contamination by VSDMs implies an excessive load, leading to stochastic mutation load paradox.

&gt; ""accumulation of VSDMs in a lineage [...] acts like a time bomb [...] **the existence of vertebrate lineages [...] should be limited to 10^(6)-10^(7) generations**.

Throughout the paper, this problem is referred to as the ""stochastic mutation load paradox"". It is a paradox only because long-term evolution is not true, but that will NEVER be acknowledged, unless some other **naturalistic** theory displaces it. This has been the situation throughout the decades. Similarly, gaps in the fossil record were denied until Niles and Eldridge concocted their ""Punctuated Equilibria"" tale in 1981, at which time the gaps were openly acknowledged.

Kondrashov followed this paper with yet another^(14) in 2002. In it, the mutation rate per offspring per generation was set to the (minimum) value at which it remains today:

&gt; ""The total number of new mutations per diploid human genome per generation is about 100 [...] at least 10% of these are deleterious [...] analysis of human variability suggests that a normal person carries thousands of deleterious alleles""

Notice: One hundred is 1,000 times the value that early evolutionists calculated was tolerable without experiencing error catastrophe!

And how long would it take for the human genome to take on ""thousands"" of (let's say 5,000) deleterious alleles? At only 25 per generation and a generation period of 30 years, it would take only **6,000 years**! Does that ring a bell?

---

The story is not finished. I can give a half-dozen more significant papers since 2000 that nail the coffin shut on evolution. But I'm tired of writing and I'm afraid you won't read it anyhow. After all, I am a computer design engineer, not an EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST, so what can I know?

But if you ask, I'll post another (slightly shorter) article discussing them.

&gt; ""The argument here is that bad mutations accumulate to the point that on average, each individual would produce fewer than one viable offspring, leading to extinction. The term for this event is **error catastrophe**. The problem with this idea is that we have never observed it in any natural population, and we haven't even confirmed experimentally that it's possible in practice. It is possible in theory. The math works. But attempts to demonstrate that it can actually happen have been, at best, inconclusive. Here's some detail: The fastest mutating organisms on earth are RNA viruses, that is, viruses with RNA genomes, as opposed to DNA genomes like ours. RNA is less stable that DNA, and the copying machinery for RNA is less precise [my off-topic comment: this is a problem for the RNA world], so RNA mutates faster. No population of RNA viruses in nature has been shown to experience error catastrophe, and while RNA viruses can be driven to extinction in the lab by treating them with mutagens, it has not been conclusively shown that the extinction is due specifically to this mechanism.""

He continues on to give more detail. I think this is an area of specialization for this excellent evolutionary biologist.

Nevertheless, I disagree with him, though. Error catastrophe is more likely to occur in complex, ""low-fecundity"" organisms than in ultra-simple organisms (viruses are not even a form of life) that breed faster than rabbits. The reason is that these ""higher"" organisms are already stressed because, in Haldane's cost-based budgeting system, higher organisms have fewer excess offspring to sacrifice to selection. Simple, fecund organisms like viruses can often sacrifice 99% of their offspring to selection.

As I've mentioned in other articles, the latest estimates are that humans suffer **over 100 mutations per offspring per generation**. Most of these mutations are either neutral or very slightly deleterious (VSDMs), thankfully, but deleterious mutations are perhaps 1000 times more numerous than equivalently beneficial mutations. That means that humans are being loaded with deleterious mutations far faster than they can hope to select them out.

Quantifying the effects of this influence can be difficult, but we need merely look at the birth rates in many nations as evidence, and even the plummeting global birth rate. While it is true that much of this can be attributed to conscious efforts at preventing overpopulation, it is still also true that world citizens seem to have lost their drive to reproduce. Parenthood is scary to enter into and lacks clear personal benefits, and I can only imagine what it's like for a woman to dread that first childbirth experience. But like other animals, humans have always had an innate drive to procreate that overcomes these fears. We're losing that drive. Perhaps the clearest example of this is Japan. An article asks, [""Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex?""](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex) And for those who do have sex, most think that the purpose of sex is recreation not procreation, and pregnancy is a disease to be avoided. The drive to maintain the line is being lost. Other problems are mounting, too: allergies, which are caused by an immune system gone awry, are on the rise. The allergies are to things that have long been in the environment like pollen, dust, grass, corn, fish and peanuts, not to new artificial man-made chemicals (except perhaps latex). Why is our fine-tuned immune system going out of tune? I suggest that it's VSDMs.

And in the animal world among higher animals, the situation is no better. Although many extinctions can be blamed on loss of habitat, many cannot—they simply cannot reproduce effectively. Error catastrophe is a likely cause.

&gt;Perhaps one could attribute the obnoxious presence of the Alu sequences to degenerative biological processes that are not the result of ID. But was the Designer incompetent or malevolent in not avoiding the eventuality of this degeneration? -- Francisco Ayala
 one of the world’s leading evolutionary biologists


Ah, but that was mere 6 years ago, in 2010. What do we know in light now of laboratory experiments just a few years later? A back of the envelope calculation demonstrates that the Alu units which Ayala considered degenerate trash are now realized to have the potential to collectively implement 10^16 bytes of information in the brain and nervous system.

Here is the supporting documentation. First the computer RAM analogy to Alus as published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences:


&gt;These findings bring to mind information storage models. As the number of potential editing sites in each Alu-containing transcript is high, usually several dozens, the potential for combinatorial encrypted information is enormous. Binary use of A or I in millions of sites in the neural cell transcriptome can be considered equivalent to the 0’s and 1’s used for information storage and processing by computers. It is tempting to speculate that the more abundant RNA editing found in the human brain may contribute to the more advanced human capabilities such as memory, learning, and cognition. This suggestion is consistent with the hypothesis that the advantage of complex organisms lies in the development of a digital programming system based on noncoding RNA signaling (46, 56). The combinatorial posttranscriptional RNA editing of noncoding sequences may therefore contribute to higher brain functions and may play a role in the evolution of human specialization.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901480/ 

How enormous? For one cell enormous, for a billion cells enormoser!


&gt;A-to-I RNA editing occurs at over a hundred million genomic sites, located in a majority of human genes
&gt;….
&gt;With these results, A-to-I editing becomes the most comprehensively characterized post transcriptional modification. The massive number of Alu editing events dwarfs the few known functional and conserved editing events within the coding regions, and accounts for &gt;99% of all ADAR deamination reactions. The fact that such a heavy burden was not selected against raises
 the possibility that a fraction of the plethora of Alu editing sites may have been utilized, in ways that remain unknown (Mattick 2009; Paz-Yaacov et al. 2010), in the course of primate evolution. 

If there are approximately 1 billion brain cells, and 100 million bits of information being stored in each cell through the Alu-generated transcripts, using a back-of-the envelope calculation, the combined information storage capacity of the Alu-generated transcripts is on the order of : 10^17 bits which is 1.25 x 10^16 bytes. By way of comparison, a recent estimate of the brains storage capacity based on was suggested at 2.5 x 10^15 bytes. From Scientific American:
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/

Another news report in 2010 regarding work at the Stanford Universitiy Medical Center:


&gt;the brain’s overall complexity is almost beyond belief, said [Dr. Stephen] Smith. “One synapse, by itself, is more like a microprocessor — with both memory-storage and information-processing elements — than a mere on/off switch. In fact, one synapse may contain on the order of 1,000 molecular-scale switches. A single human brain has more switches than all the computers and routers and Internet connections on Earth,”

Are you serious, ZDF42?

These simple diagrams do not provide the explanation I am seeking. [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus), a Christian and considered the founder of taxonomy, classified animals according to their similarities before Darwin even made the scene. Classification of objects into hierarchical trees is a very useful activity, and it helps us process a large amount of data with minimum effort. But products of intelligent design (and in fact, pretty much any collections of objects) can also be classified. You perform this task every time you organize the junk drawer in your kitchen.

---

The issue I am addressing stems from my understanding of information space and the distances that separate points in that space. Information space is N-dimensional, where N is typically very large, comprising all the variables in the space (e.g., for the human genome there are 6 billion bits, so N=6 billion; N for the information space that would contain ALL genomes is unimaginably large!). Over my career as a computer design engineer, I have had to deal with many such spaces, and it has intrigued me how similar these spaces appear in many disparate applications. What I know about DNA and its coding tells me that it is similar in biology as well. In fact, I can't imagine how it could be different—such is the nature of information.

Information spaces that I have encountered have always had similar types of layout. It fact, the similarities are innate characteristics of information spaces. The reliable operation of the computers we all use every day relies on firm understanding of these similarities in concept. For example, [error detection and correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction) utilizes these principles. If the information space can be configured such that all legal data points are at least two ""hops"" (i.e., mutations) apart, then the system can perform single-error detection (SED) on any single error (mutation), because a single hop will always land on an illegal location. Similarly, if they are all three hops apart, the system can not only detect single single errors, it can correct them[!] (single-error correction--SEC), because every legal data point is surrounded by illegal data points that no other legal data point can reach in a single hop. Four hop distances achieves single-error correction AND double-error detection ([SECDED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code#Hamming_codes_with_additional_parity_.28SECDED.29)), and so on.

As I said, the dimension, N, is typically very large. To permit visualization, though, let's consider a 2-dimensional map space. On this map space—imagine a map of the earth—some points are easy to get to from a specific starting point, and some are more difficult. Some connections can be made by walking, some require bridges to traverse, and some cannot be traversed without a ship. So let's say that on this map, the watery locations represent illegal points in the data space (an ""illegal"" point in DNA's information space would be a genome that expresses an unfit phenome), and our ""hops"" represent mutations. Also, let's say that there are no bridges or ships (which is true for DNA). You must hop—mutate—to wherever you want to go. Small hops are easy and frequent, but occasionally you can, with more effort, perform a ""double-hop"" to cross a small body of water. VERY rarely, you can, with tremendous effort, execute a ""triple-hop"". Anything more is unreasonable to expect.

You can probably see where I'm going. It is not enough to show that you can hop from Chicago to Milwaukee, even if you can do that quickly and you have all the time you want to go other places. You'll never get to Bermuda or Hawaii by hopping, no matter how much time you have, because the huge gulf cannot be hopped. And this is a common characteristic of information spaces—they are populated with ""continents"" and ""islands"" of legal (valid, useful, functional) points, separated from each other by vast oceans of illegality or nonsense.

The closest analogy to the information space of genomes is probably the information space of books. Many times, blocks of text are used as analogies to elucidate genetic concepts. Maynard Smith used the WORD =&gt; WORE =&gt; GORE =&gt; GONE =&gt; GENE sequence to illustrate how point mutations might totally modify a gene's makeup (but it only works on short, carefully selected words). Richard Dawkins used the ""methinks it is like a weasel"" phrase from Hamlet to illustrate (in a flawed manner) how evolution might progress (flawed because his algorithm requires teleology—prior knowledge of the goal—which natural selection does not possess). Stephen Hawking used the analogy of an infinitude of monkeys randomly typing out a Shakespearean sonnet (or anything else, no matter how long, an infinitude of times!) to illustrate how infinite time overcomes all probabilistic obstacles (however, our time has been finite). Likewise, I will use text as an analogy.

As I mentioned earlier, the information space that contains all books ever written is awesomely large, and almost all of the space is incoherent gibberish. If I had to guess, I would have to say that all but perhaps 10^(-1,000,000) of the space is nonsensical, and 10^(-1,000,000,000) of the space is occupied by anything anyone ever actually wrote. The oceans between coherent combinations of letters cannot be traversed by accident. That is why a student can be properly accused of plagiarism if he repeats something another author wrote without crediting him.

In fact, even though a book-sized piece of text is the proper analogy to a genome, we don't have to go that far to see the phenomenon I'm trying to highlight in action. You can see it in paragraphs or even in sentences, or even in single words! To illustrate this, I wrote a program to test this out on the information space that contains all English words of 18 letters or less.

Here's what I did: I downloaded a copy of the entire official Scrabble^(®) word list—all 172,880 of them. There are words there that you'll never use or encounter, like ""bigeminies"", ""koumysses"", ""solonetzic"" and ""deuteranomolous"". Using a richly populated word list makes my results as conservative as possible. I then wrote a program that calculates the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) (equivalent to the number of ""mutations"" it takes to get from one word to the other) between every word and every other word, a total of (172,880) * (172,879) ≈ 30 billion calculations, which took several days to calculate on my PC. I was then able to scan the results and find out how ""isolated"" various word groups were from each other. It was very enlightening, but the most significant result was that, in order to get from any word to any other word (as evolution claims, due to common descent), I had to perform at least one ""hexa-hop"", which involves performing six simultaneous mutations in one hop. That's one third of the word that had to be changed (since the source and destination were no more than 18 letters long)!

The situation is near-infinitely worse for the information space that contains all possible genomes. I see no way that the oceans of incoherent junk can be traversed in such a sparsely populated information space!

If you think it can, it'd better be on the basis of some actual data, not a set of hand-waving charts.

And if you think neutral evolution can solve this for you, I'll have to do a similar discussion on why that's pie-in-the-sky daydreaming.

Here is a quote from the abstract for one of the articles provided to me, [The Origins of the RNA World](http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/5/a003608.long):

&gt; A thorough consideration of this “RNA-first” view of the origin of life must reconcile concerns regarding the intractable [hard to control or deal with] mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. **Perhaps these concerns will eventually be resolved**, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, **the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved**, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.

Later in the same article the authors state:

&gt; Scientists interested in the origins of life seem to divide neatly into two classes. The first, usually but not always molecular biologists, *believe* that RNA must have been the first replicating molecule and that chemists are exaggerating the difficulties of nucleotide synthesis. They *believe* that **a few more striking chemical “surprises”** will establish that a pool of racemic mononucleotides could have formed on the primitive Earth, and that further experiments with different activating groups, minerals, and chiral amplification processes will solve the **enantiomeric cross-inhibition problem**. The second group of scientists are much more **pessimistic**. They believe that **the de novo appearance of oligonucleotides on the abiotic Earth would have been a near miracle**. Time will tell which is correct.

This is not a dispute over which of two very promising candidates is the actual solution; rather, the strongest argument for each proposition is the obvious weakness of the other. In point of fact, **both** positions are extremely weak, with seemingly insuperable obstacles to solution. If one is not, as I am not, restricted by marriage to the MN presupposition to consider only spontaneous-generation options, one would reject both as near-impossible. At the very least, the MN-bound scientist should be free to admit that neither proposition is currently tenable.

Elsewhere in the same article:

&gt; A more **tenuous argument** can be made regarding whether life on Earth began with RNA.

In my experience, when an evolutionary biologist categorizes a pro-evolution argument as ""tenuous"", it can be read as ""near-impossible"". Continuing:

&gt; In what has been referred to as **“The Molecular Biologist's Dream”** (Joyce and Orgel 1993), one **might imagine** that all of the components of RNA were available in some prebiotic pool, and that these components could have assembled into replicating, evolving polynucleotides without the prior existence of any evolved macromolecules. However, a thorough consideration of this “RNA-first” view of the origin of life inevitably triggers **“The Prebiotic Chemist's Nightmare”**, with visions of the intractable mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. **Perhaps this continuing nightmare will eventually have a happy ending**, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is **far from being solved**, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.

Again, the question boils down to: ""which is the **less impossible** of the only two naturalistic alternatives?"" The main driving force behind the search for some mechanism that precedes even RNA seems to be the fact that spontaneous generation of RNA appears to many to be hopeless; it is not driven by some clear hopeful antecedent.

I'm really surprised (actually, not) that you find such encouragement in the activities discussed in the article. Yes, progress has been made, but at every turn, new dilemmas emerge, or old ones are found to more intractable than previously hoped. Some more excerpts:

&gt; Overcoming the **self-structure problem** using the standard C and G nucleotides is **very difficult** because it requires the discovery of conditions that favor the binding of mononucleotides to allow template-directed synthesis to occur, but suppress the formation of long duplex regions that would exclude activated monomers from the template.

Yet another example:

&gt; A related nonenzymatic replication scheme involves synthesis by the ligation of short 3′,5′-linked oligomers (James and Ellington 1999). This is certainly an attractive possibility, made more plausible by the discovery of analogous ribozyme-catalyzed reactions (Bartel and Szostak 1993), but it faces **two major obstacles**. The first is the **difficulty of obtaining the substrates in the first place [!]**. The second is concerned with fidelity. Pairs of oligonucleotides containing a single base mismatch, particularly if the mismatch forms a G•U wobble pair, still hybridize as efficiently as fully complementary oligomers, except in a temperature range very close to the melting point of the perfectly paired structure. **Maintaining fidelity would** therefore **be difficult under any plausible temperature regime**.

Consider the following paragraph, with my remarks inserted in brackets:

&gt; The RNA-first view of the origin of life **assumes** that a supply of activated ß-d-nucleotides [the ""-d-"" means that the nucleotides are enantiopure dextrorotatory, something that my opponents here claim is unnecessary] was available by some **as yet unrecognized abiotic process**. Furthermore, it **assumes** that a[n undiscovered] means existed to convert the activated nucleotides to an ensemble of random-sequence polynucleotides, a subset of which had the ability to replicate [what an assumption!]. It seems to be implicit in the model that such polynucleotides replicate themselves but, for whatever reason, do not replicate unrelated neighbors. It is **not clear** whether replication involves one molecule copying itself (and its complement) or a family of molecules that together copy each other. **These questions are set aside for the moment** in order to first consider the question of whether an RNA molecule of reasonably short length can catalyze its own replication with sufficiently high fidelity [both catalysis rate and fidelity are serious concerns].

At this point, I have only commented on the first quarter of the paper. The remainder is similarly filled with reports of hopeful progress amidst problems at every turn. It would take me another day to list all the problems detailed, but I hope you can see why a reader that is not obligated to find an abiogenetic storyline is not overly impressed.

The last paragraph of the paper, under the title ""Concluding Remarks"", states:

&gt; The **presumed** RNA World should be viewed as a milestone, a plateau in the early history of life on Earth. So too, the concept of an RNA World has been a milestone in the scientific study of life's origins. While **this concept does not explain how life originated**, it has helped to guide scientific thinking and has served to focus experimental efforts. Further progress will depend primarily on new experimental results, as chemists, biochemists, and molecular biologists work together to address problems concerning molecular replication, ribozyme enzymology, and RNA-based cellular processes.

# This Concept Does Not Explain How Life Originated

So, in summary, **this concept does not explain how life originated!**

One final note: take into consideration the fact that this article is written by researchers who derive their funding from sources who are looking for a naturalistic solution to the abiogenesis dilemma. I'm sure the researchers share this goal, but even if they didn't (say they were closet creationists), they cannot come out and report, ""this RNA world idea is unadulterated hogwash"". That would be the end of their funding and their career. Only one outcome is permitted: HOPE.

This [biology textbook](http://imgur.com/a/qf7kb) by Raven &amp; Johnson is one of the most popular college-level general biology textbooks, with over a million copies in print. [Page 420](http://imgur.com/a/xdNSW) is dedicated to the refutation of creationism. Here is a [close-up](http://imgur.com/a/BYeiL) of objection six of the six objections that the authors claim creationists have to evolution. I have re-entered the text below for the this item:

&gt; **Proteins are too improbable.** *""hemoglobin has 141 amino acids in its chain. The probability that the first one would be leucine is 1/20, and that all 141 would be the ones they are by chance is (1/20)^(141), an impossibly rare event!""* This is statistical foolishness—you can not use probability to argue backwards. The probability that a student in a classroom has a particular birthday is 1/365; arguing this way, the probability that everyone in a class of 50 would have the birthdays they do is (1/365)^(50), and yet there the class sits.

---

Right off, we have a problem, because creationists would not choose to discuss hemoglobin, of all proteins. That's the problem that occurs when one side sets up the straw-man to attack as its opponent. Rather, we creationists would choose one (or all!) of the 300 or so proteins that researchers have identified as essential to all life. Let me say that again. These proteins are essential to all life. Evolutionists insist that there is some sort of pre-life evolution that occurs, possibly via RNA. Creationists disagree. But that is a debate for another time. Based on the classroom analogy chosen, we must conclude that the question at hand is whether it makes sense to claim that a long-chain protein as complex as hemoglobin can randomly form spontaneously.

---

I hope you can see the lack of understanding of the principles of ""probability 101"" displayed by the authors of this otherwise fine textbook.

The authors say that ""you can not use probability to argue backwards"". Is that true?

In some cases no, and in others, yes. The crucial question is, what is the likelihood of each class member having the birthday that he in fact possesses? If we are talking about the the people in the actual classroom, they cannot help but have the birthdays that they have, so the probability is not 1/365, but rather exactly one! And the probability that entire class has the birthdays they in fact have will therefore also be exactly one. It cannot be otherwise, because we start out assuming that we are talking about a specific group of people.

But the situation is different for the hemoglobin protein. In this case, we are not trying to determine what the likelihood is that the protein has the specific configuration that it in fact possesses (which would also be exactly one), but we are trying to determine the likelihood that such a configuration would spontaneously form. Here, the entire panoply of possible combinations of amino acids at the 141 loci is in play.

Here is another way to explain:

To be sure, every 141-amino-acid protein chain would have the same extraordinarily low likelihood of occurring spontaneously. But there is a crucial difference between the protein and its classroom analog. The protein exhibits **specified complexity**—that is, there is a special importance attributed to a very specific, very small set of possible configurations of this 141-long chain, because its members can perform the function of oxygen transport. By contrast, the 50 members of the classroom can possess any birthdays, and it would not make any difference.

To illustrate why this is important, let's see what you would think if we started asking the class members what their birthdays were. The first person asked replies that her birthday is January 1^(st). Somewhat remarkable, since that is a unique day with its own special name (Like Christmas and Independence Day). So you ask the second person and his is also New Year's Day. And, you guessed it, all 50 people turn out to have their birthdays on New Year's Day!

Suddenly, your classroom's members turn out to exhibit a mild form of specified complexity. After the third or fourth person reports the same birth date, you would certainly begin to wonder how such an unlikely thing could be. And when you finish and find that all 50, or even 45 of the 50, have that same birth date, you would be certain, and justifiably so, that something other than randomness was afoot. Some possibilities would be: someone is playing a practical joke on you, or this classroom is being convened at a convention for New Year's Babies. This would be a better analogy to the hemoglobin than the mere typical group of 50 people.

---

I do not accuse the authors of a general lack of understanding of the laws of probability. That's highly ""improbable"". Rather, it is a case of localized blindness due to the extreme pro-evolution bias that is pandemic in the scientific community. In any other subject area, they would analyze the situation rationally.

DebateEvolution,53qv53,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Empirical Validation of Phylogenetic Methods,"One relatively common objection to evolutionary theory is that it is backwards-looking with regard to evolutionary histories. Sure, it *looks* like two species may be related, but how do we *know*? Well, we don’t, we can only say what is most *likely*, and phylogenetics provides the tools to make that assessment. 

&amp;nbsp;

In a paper titled [“Experimental Phylogenetics: Generation of a Known Phylogeny,” (Science, 1992),](http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/cmoyer/zztemp_fire/biol445D_W00/exp_phylo.pdf) David Hillis et al. generated nine populations of bacteriophage from a common ancestor. The relationships among these groups (the true phylogeny) was therefore known. 

&amp;nbsp;

They then conducted phylogenetic analysis of the nine terminal populations, and reconstructed their phylogeny using five different methods, including neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood. 

&amp;nbsp;

Each of the five methods they used successfully resulted in reconstruction of the correct phylogeny. There were differences in branch length between the methods, but no differences in terms of the tree topology, i.e. which populations were deemed to be most closely related to each other. This experiment validated the main phylogenetic methods in use at the time, and which are still used today. By demonstrating that phylogenetic methods can accurately reconstruct phylogenies, Hillis et al. demonstrated the validity of methods used to determine evolutionary relationships among extant species. 

&amp;nbsp;

Short version: Phylogenetics is a valid way of determining the relationships among populations and species. This experiment demonstrates that conclusively.

In the creation-evolution controversy, creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis ""evolutionists"" and the theory itself as ""evolutionism.""

&gt; The term is generally rejected by scientists, as the suffix '-ism' carries a connotation of belief and thereby falsely claims that evolution is a religion. It is also used to equate a 'belief' in evolution with other philosophical movements, most of which are very accepting of evolution, such as atheism and secular humanism. This serves primarily to pull 'evolutionism' down to the level of creationism, as equally faith-based belief systems. Capitalizing the word, to make 'Evolutionism', is a similar tactic.

DebateEvolution,537rr1,No-Karma-II,,t2_ya3uo,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution is accepted in spite of the fact that not a single evolutionary pathway has been documented or theorized in detail,"## I'm posting this from a buried comment, since I put a bit of work into generating it:

From /u/Simyala:

&gt; &gt; Evolution is accepted in spite of the fact that not a single evolutionary pathway has been documented or theorized in detail
&gt; 
&gt; We don't know the exact genetic mutations that happen.

Evolutionary critics don't expect—at least, I don't—evolutionists to detail every last actual mutation in the pathway that purportedly occurred. But critics like myself don't believe that *any* pathway exists.

And my incredulity is not due to ignorance; it is informed incredulity. This is an information theory problem, whether evolutionary biologists like it or not, and must be examined in that manner. As a computer designer, it's my bread and butter^(1). We use a process very similar to the process of mutation and natural selection to route extremely complex circuit boards and gate arrays. We simply throw all the logic elements of an entire design onto its substrate randomly, and then attempt to route all the ""wires"". The fist attempt is guaranteed to fail, but it gives us a metric—the number of unrouted connections—to use as a starting point. Then we allow the placements of the logic elements to be randomly swapped—mutated, if you will—and we reroute the board. If the number of unrouted connections decreases, we keep the new placement—selection, if you will—and if not, we return to the original. This process is repeated over and over until the circuitry successfully routes or fails altogether. In addition, we perform the placement swaps in a manner that parallels the metallurgical process of [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy\)), wherein a metal is heated and then cooled slowly. In a like manner, we allow the random re-placements of the logic elements to be coarse and radical at first (high-temperature), and then we slowly restrict the re-placements to be more subtle on subsequent iterations. This whole process is like taking a box of corn flakes, or a jar of marbles, and settling the contents by shaking it—vigorously at first, and then progressively more mildly.

A comment on this technique: This is by no means a process that requires no intelligent design input. We have invested years and millions of dollars on a staff of engineers and computer scientists to find innovative methods: separating the placement phase from the routing phase, fine-tuning the annealing process by adjusting the ""temperature"" curve during ""cooling"" process, and coming up with novel solutions to design issues.

Also, this process is not a direct parallel to evolution. The parallel to evolution would do something like taking an existing design—say a radio—and ""evolving"" it into a TV by randomly injecting changes into the design and then selecting the changes that move the unit's performance from that of a radio to that of a TV. This technique has been attempted, albeit on a trivially simple design: the researchers threw some logic on a board and attempted, successfully, to create a circuit that generates a periodic pulse output.

So, what is the difference that makes this technique work on board routing, but not on ""evolution"" from a radio to a TV? The difference is an information theory difference. In the case of the board routing, there is an unimaginably large number of possible solutions, and they are interconnected in N-dimensional solution space by small hops, so the software can randomly navigate the small hops to eventually arrive to an optimal solution (if one exists). In the case of the (radio =&gt; TV), the two designs are separated by a huge gulf of inoperable nonsense solutions, so that there are no ""stepping stones"" that allow navigation from the start to the finish.

Although evolutionists have not offered a single pathway for a single evolutionary advance, some of the necessary hops are just absurdly impossible:

* the gecko's ""evolution"" from perfectly adequate clawed-feet to sophisticated but unnecessary pads that exploit Van Der Waals' attraction;
* the frog that gestates its eggs by disabling its digestive juices for weeks, and swallowing(!) the eggs, then regurgitating them as froglets;
* the lampsilis mussel that dangles a perfectly-formed ""lure"" to attract a specific species of fish, so that when the fish attacks the lure, the mussel can expel baby mussels that enter the fish's mouth and attach to the gills as a blood food supply;
* the pacific golden plover, that flies on its maiden nonstop 72-hour voyage, guided entirely by instinct, from the shores of Alaska to the tiny Hawaiian islands, over featureless ocean with no ""stepping stones"" to allow step-by-step evolution of this astonishing odyssey;
* the ogre-faced spider, that spins a net on its legs, then waits for its prey, which it attacks using its net, gladiator-style, to entangle its prey;
* the bolo spider, that throws a glob of silk at passing moths, bolo-style, to capture them;
* the list is endless—need I say more?

# How does the addition of even the possibility of supernatural agency enhance my understanding of the natural world, particularly since the naturalistic theory that I currently use does a pretty fine job?

Explaining nature purely from within nature is an exercise in recursion (self-reference), and recursion has a very poor record of success. Let me pose some questions about nature that cannot be answered from within nature, and you tell me if it is important to you that we find answers to any of them:

* Does the addition of even the possibility of supernatural agency enhance my understanding of the natural world?
* How did the natural world come to be, since it is now [generally agreed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) that it had a beginning? [NOTE: it is also [generally acknowledged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe) that many of the universe's independent physical constants, which can take on any value, MUST have the very specific values they possess in order for a plethora of events to occur, such as for galaxies and stars to form and carbon to form (via the [triple-alpha resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process#Resonances)). Many other ""coincidences"" make our universe very special indeed!]
* Are we humans obligated to behave in any particular way in this natural world?
* Is our natural world a mere part of something greater than itself?
* Do humans other than myself feel pain? How about dogs? Dogwoods?

Truly, to answer the most important questions about the natural world, we must look beyond the natural world.

Recursion has failed is in logic, set theory and general mathematics, and it will fail us in science as well.

##In Logic:

Is this statement true or false?

    This statement is true.

If it is true then it is true, and if it is false then it is false. It tells us nothing; therefore, it is a nonsense statement.

Is this statement true or false?

    This statement is false.

If it is true then it is false, and if it is false then it is true. Both cases lead to inconsistency; therefore, it is a nonsense statement.

In both examples, the problem is recursion (self-reference).

##In Set Theory:

Near the end of the 18th century, set theory was developing. Mathematician Georg Cantor was working on what was called ""intuitive set theory"". He defined a set thus:

&gt; A set is any collection into a whole of definite and separate objects of our intuition or our thought.

Notice that this definition is recursive, since sets are, by this definition, themselves set members.

In 1902, another mathematician, Gottlieb Frege, was about to publish the results of his extensive research, when he was contacted by the young mathematician Bertrand Russel, with very bad news: his research was in vain, because Russel could prove that the intuitive set definition led to inconsitencies. He reasoned thus:

Let us define a set as **Normal** when it does *not* contain itself as a member (e.g., the set of all dogs), and as **Non-Normal** when it *does* contain itself as a member (i.e., it is recursive) (e.g., the set of all ideas). Now, let **N** represent the set of all **Normal** sets. We then ask, ""Is **N** itself a **Normal** set?""

If **N** is **Normal**, then **N** must contain itself, since **N** was defined as containing all **Normal** sets; however, if **N** contains itself, then it is by definition **Non-Normal**. ERROR: contradiction!

If N is **Non-Normal**, then by definition, it is a member of itself. However, if **N** is a member of itself, then it must be **Normal**, since **N** was defined as containing only **Normal** sets. ERROR: contradiction!

Once again, the problem is recursion (self-reference).

##In General Mathematics: 

Kurt Gödel's [Incompleteness Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) rocked the world of mathematical academia in 1931 by **proving**(!) that all efforts to establish a complete and consistent set of axioms to undergird our mathematics are *futile*!

Our mathematics can be either complete or consistent, but not both. We choose to say that it is consistent but not complete, which means that there exist statements that are true but not provable. An example is the ""Gödel Sentence"":

    This statement cannot be proved.

If this sentence cannot be proved, and is therefore true, then our system is incomplete. If it can be proved, then it proves a false statement, and our system is inconsistent.

For a third time, the problem is recursion (self-reference). If we ""know"" that our mathematical system is consistent and complete, it is by some means other than mathematical rigor!

Tellingly, theorems that are (assumed) true but unprovable have been called ""supernatural"" theorems^(1). Of course, we can never *know for sure* (i.e., prove) that a theorem is supernatural, but the most famous candidate is [Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture):

    Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

This statement will either be someday proved false or else forever remain a mere unproved candidate.

You sound as though you are an adherent to [scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism),

&gt; ""the view that the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society.""

The very definition of the view cannot be induced via the ""inductive methods of the natural sciences"", and thus it contradicts itself! In addition, inductive methods are subject to error and are thus deductively fallacious.

(1) Occurring by chance.
(2) Having a no direction, goal, or purpose

Evolution (mutations + selection) isn't random in the first sense of the word, but it is definitely random in the second sense of the word. And that evolution is random matters, especially when compared to the classical views of humanity held self-evident by every thinker prior to 1860.

**Christian Philosophers.** The purpose of life is to attain the beautific vision and find ultimate satisfaction and pleasure in God, who is love.

**Virtuous Pagans of Greece.** The purpose of life is to know and apprehend the Good (as formulated, by instance, Plato).

**Unvirtuous Pagans of Greece.** The purpose of life is to pursue pleasure and avoid pain.

**Evolutionary Biologists.** The purpose of life is that you have no purpose. Everything that you do is really because you've been programmed to be a good guardian of your genes and have a good probability of ensuring that your genes will copy themselves and flourish.

This is a big deal. Evolution says that one of the ultimate questions  is nonsense, namely, what is my purpose. I have no purpose because Evolution has no goal. Man cannot even make his own purpose because man is incapable of satisfying himself; to assume that man can make his own purpose is to assume that man is basically good, and that therefore man can be a good in itself.",51,1473499580,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/522e24/why_evolution_mutations_selection_is_random_and/

DebateEvolution,519jw7,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Junk DNA is Real and Doesn't Care if You Admit It.,"The idea that junk DNA doesn’t exist, and therefore represents a failed evolutionary prediction, is a common argument from creationists. The idea is that if creation is accurate, you’d expect everything to have a purpose, while evolutionary theory predicts that many features will not have a specific, selected function. (This contradicts other creationist claims, but that’s a different discussion.) Extending this idea to the genome, the idea is that under evolutionary theory, we’d expect that much of the DNA in the genome of any given organism is nonfunctional, while creation predicts functionality for the vast majority of bases in the a genome. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before we get into the arguments, we need to define a few things first.

Most importantly, junk DNA: Junk DNA is DNA that does not have a *selected function* and is not harmful. That is to say, it is DNA that is neither necessary nor detrimental; if you were to remove it from the genome, there would be no discernable effect on fitness. 

Second most important definition: Functional. Functional *does not* simply mean “does something.” There are many types of DNA that “do something” but are not functional. In this context, functional means having a selected function, i.e. if you removed it, there would be a fitness cost. Another way to say functional in this context is “contributes to cell physiology.”

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s get to it. I’m going to discuss this mostly in the context of the human genome, but I’ll bring other organisms into it where appropriate. I’ll try to be clear with regard to exactly what genome I’m talking about, but if I don’t specify, assume ours. 

&amp;nbsp;

So the evidence that junk DNA exists is crystal clear: Only about 2% of the human genome is actual protein-encoding genes. That **does not** mean that all of the rest is nonfunctional. There are a lot of functions associated with non-coding DNA. Regulatory regions like promoters, enhancers, and silencers are all non-coding but extremely important functionally. Structural regions like centromeres and telomeres are critical but non-coding. There are regions that must be a specific length, even though the sequence itself doesn’t matter. There are regions that are transcribed but not translated, such as DNA coding for ribosomal RNA, tRNAs, or micro-RNAs. These are not protein-encoding genes, but they are extremely important. All of these are examples of functional non-coding DNA. 

&amp;nbsp;

When you add all of these regions and classes together, coding regions and functional noncoding regions, you get about 10% of the human genome as functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what of the other 90%? If you’re going to argue that junk DNA isn’t real, you need to demonstrate that the vast majority of that remaining 90% is functional, i.e. has been selected to do something. So let’s dig into that 90% and see if we can find such functionality.

&amp;nbsp;

First, we need to acknowledge that some of that DNA is not “junk” because in addition to “not functional,” junk also implies “not harmful.” Some relatively small proportion of that 90% is going to be harmful in some way, so that’s out. I mention that briefly first because 1) it’s such a small % I don’t think it really matters for this discussion, and 2) I don’t think there’s any real disagreement on whether it exists. So that’s that. 

&amp;nbsp;

Other things that make up that 90%:

**Introns.** Noncoding regions found within genes. Excised after transcription. People have spent decades looking for a function. We still don’t have one. Introns are about 25% of the human genome. 

**Transposable elements.** These are sequences or regions that can or at some point could replicate and insert themselves somewhere else in a genome. Many are derived from retroviruses and called *endogenous retroviruses*, or ERVs, meaning retroviruses that inserted into our genome and then mutated and got stuck. ERVs alone are about 8% of the human genome. Additional transposable elements, such as SINEs, LINEs, and DNA transposons (as opposed to retrotransposons – ERVs, SINEs, LINEs), bring the total up to 44% or so, and none of it qualifies as functional.  

**Repeats**. These are just sequences that are, duh, repeats. The same thing over and over for some length in the DNA. There are many types of repeats, some very short and simple (e.g. tandem repeats and microsatellites) and some larger (e.g. segmental duplications). There is a lot of overlap between this category and transposable elements, since many of those include regions of repeats. There are also some regions that are functional that are composed of repeats. For example, some regulatory elements require a specific distance between them, independent of the sequence of that region. In some cases, those regions are comprised of repeats. Inclusively, repeats are over 50% of the human genome. If you remove transposable elements and length-dependent functional regions, it’s about 15%.

**Unique noncoding DNA**. This is the simplest category, it’s just non-repeat, non-transposon sequences that aren’t coding. In total, this is about 15% of the genome, but again, that includes some functional stuff, regulatory sequences and such. So remove those and you’re looking at 5-10% of the genome as *non-functional* unique sequences. 

**Pseudogenes**. These are sequences that were at some point active, protein-coding genes, but due to mutations to the regulatory mechanism or the gene sequence itself, are no longer functional. There are about 13,000 pseudogenes in the human genome. These would fall under the last category, unique noncoding DNA, but there are a lot of them so I wanted to mention them specifically. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s a rundown of the different types of non-functional DNA in the human genome.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are going to claim that junk DNA doesn’t exist, then you need to demonstrate that the vast majority of these elements are functional, i.e., have been selected to do something that contributes to cell physiology. 

&amp;nbsp;

You may have heard of the ENCODE project, which seeks to assign functions to most of the human genome. According to encode, 80-90% of the human genome is functional. However, they achieve this level of functionality by using an expansive definition of “functional” that sweeps in any DNA sequences that *does something*, even if that activity is not related to the physiology of the cell. For example, any transcribed sequence is functional according to ENCODE. That **includes** ERVs and pseudogenes. According to ENCODE, any sequence that binds to a protein is functional. But that ropes in pseudogenes with intact regulatory sequences. It includes transposons with intact protein binding sites.  These are examples of *activity*, not *function*, and only by conflating the two can ENCODE claim that 80-90% of the human genome is functional. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that’s not the whole argument. Oh, no, you think we’re done already? Get comfortable. 

&amp;nbsp;

Other organisms make the case against junk DNA even less tenable. I’m going to focus on two group – plants and protozoa – but there are other examples. 

&amp;nbsp;

Plants are extraordinarily tolerant of genome-scale changes. Polyploidy, genome duplication, they can handle it. As a result, you see extreme variation in genome size between closely related plant species. For example, the very tasty genus *Allium*, which contains onions, garlic, scallion, leak, and a ton of related species. The onion genome is about 17 *billion* base pairs, compared to about three billion for humans. Other members of *Allium* range from seven to 32 billion base pairs. If junk DNA doesn’t exist, that means an onion needs six times the information as a human, and closely related species (in the same genus) require twice as much again, while others are fine with less than half as much. At the other end of the spectrum, the raspberry genome contains fewer than 30 *million* base pairs. Is an onion plant really a thousand times more complex than a raspberry plant? 

Looking at these organisms, the idea that the vast majority of the genome is functional is not just unreasonable. It’s ludicrous. 

&amp;nbsp;

And you know what? Protozoa are even worse! Protozoa are unicellular eukaryotic organisms that are “animal-like” in their lifestyle i.e. they move around and eat things. Amoeba are protozoa, and one specific amoeba, *Amoeba dubia*, has the largest known genome: 670 billion base pairs. Over half a *trillion*. This is a unicellular organism! How on earth is an amoeba so much more complex than a plant or animal? I have no idea, but if you junk DNA doesn’t exist, most of those half trillion base pairs must be functional, so it must be. 

The problem here is that a common explanation is that the non-coding DNA is regulatory, particularly during development. So of course we don’t see functionality in adult cell cultures, those regions are only doing complex things during embryonic development, and that’s what the “other” 90% of the human genome is for. Okay, if that’s the case, why do plants and protozoa have such large genomes? Plants have much less complex developmental processes than mammals, and amoeba *are a single cell*. So what could all of that DNA possibly be doing in terms of regulating development? 

&amp;nbsp;

A much better explanation, consistent with the fact that those enormous genomes are mostly repeats, is that it is just junk.

&amp;nbsp;

So what’s the case for junk DNA? Most of the human genome doesn’t have a selected function. Closely related organisms exhibit enormous differences in genome size. The largest genomes are in unicellular eukaryotes. 

Put it all together and you have a strong case that junk DNA is real, and junk DNA is extremely common.

To demonstrate otherwise, you need to demonstrate functionality in the majority of the human genome. You need to show how functional differences explain the differences in genome size between closely related organisms like the members of *Allium*. You need to demonstrate functionality in the vast majority of the half trillion base pairs of those amoeba genomes. If you can’t do those things, you don’t have a case to make against junk DNA.

DebateEvolution,50hplw,No-Karma-II,,t2_ya3uo,self.DebateEvolution,,"The ""Argument From Incredulity"" and Evolutionary Dogma","The claim of fallacy called the ""argument from incredulity"" is often employed as a defense against creationists' criticisms of the theory of evolution. The website [RationalWiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity), a favorite of subscribers to evolutionary dogma, also lists ""argument by lack of imagination"" as an alternate name.

Now, imagination is a necessary capability for pioneers in science, who must be able to see that which others are incapable of seeing. Who would have ""imagined"" that time can elapse at different rates ""at the same time"" under different circumstances? Who would have ""imagined"" that time can have a beginning, with no ""before""? Who would have ""imagined"" that life would be based on a complex code implemented in DNA and requiring complex biological nanomachines to replicate, transcribe and translate it?

But although imagination is a necessary capability of the scientist who is *formulating* hypotheses, it should not be expected of the scientist who is *evaluating* those hypotheses. Clear scientific evidence must be brought forth that fleshes out the formulator's imaginative ideas. For the examples cited above, actual experiments have been performed that confirm that time elapse is situation-dependent, time has a beginning, and DNA is the basis of all life—there is no appeal to imagination on the part of the critic.

The argument from incredulity is only fallacious when employed as a *deductive* argument; it is not (necessarily) fallacious as an *inductive* argument. The process of scientific advancement is almost, if not entirely, an exercise in induction. Induction is itself a fallacious deductive exercise (it is for this reason that science is always tentative). Let me expand on that statement:

---

**Deduction** is generally the process of making a specific claim, based on generalized premises. For example, one might start with the premises that ""All mammals are chordates"" and ""All horses are mammals"". From these, one can *deduce* that ""All horses are chordates"". Note that properly formulated deductions are **always** correct, if the premises are correct.

---

**Induction** is the process of making a generalized claim, based on a collection of specific data (hopefully covering a wide range of circumstances). For example, one might examine many mammals from a variety of locales, all of which happen to be horses, and inductively conclude that ""All mammals are horses"". Note that conclusions that are formulated by induction are **not** always correct, and thus are deductively fallacious.

---

When a critic of evolution cannot ""imagine"", for example, how (and why) a lizard with perfectly adequate claws that enable it to climb on any surface it finds in its environment, would ""evolve"" pads on its feet that employ an entirely novel phenomenon ([Van der Waals force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force)), overcoming all the concomitant design issues (cleaning of dust and loose debris, unsticking at will when desired, etc.), and create a smooth path of probable mutations that permit it to continuously improve its ability to survive the transition from claws to pads, it is not incumbent upon the critic to possess the requisite ""imagination"" to resolve these issues. Rather, it is the evolutionists that must be imaginative enough to propose verifiable solutions to these obstacles. **Unless these issues can be properly addressed and solutions offered, they remain as evidence against the hypothesis**.

Adherents to evolutionary dogma have **never** succeeded in applying their imaginative skills and offering a **testable**, **verifiable**, **falsifiable** explanation to **any** major supposed evolutionary transition (generation of a novel organelle, organ, body plan, biological system, biochemical process, or first life itself), much less the specific difficult ones such as the lizard =&gt; gecko transition offered above.

I'm basically just a guy (a Christian) with no particular professional background in either faith, or scientific studies. Although, I'm highly interested in each field. I am a practicing Christian, but I would probably classify my self as a typical ""Christmas and easter"" Christian. I believe in God and try to live by the teaching of the Bible, but there are oviously people who know it better than me. 

Likewise, science, is a bit of a hobby for me. I'm fascinated by scientific discoveries, theories, and principles. I love reading about the scientific process, and am always reading journals and learning about new discoveries. 

I've always reconciled the two by believing that my religion has been here to teach me about how I should live my life, and treat other people. Everyone and everything was created by God and deserves to be resected as such. I have always believed that science has been a field that explores and learns everything possible about the universe god has created for us to live in. In my mind, nothing demonstrates gods awesome power more than the vast universe that expands beyond sight, created 13 odd billion years ago by a big bang (i.e. ""let there be light""). We can't understand how most things in the universe work, and we may never be able to explain why everything happens. 

Maybe I have just lived under a rock for too long, but on my own, it never crossed my mind that God and general scientific knowledge must exist independent of each other. But the more I find myself in the world, the more people I see that believe in either science, or religion (definitely not both) I just wonder why this is. Why can't god exist with everything we've discovered about the universe? Likewise, why would any of our scientific discoveries disprove the existence of god?

I hope you don't think I'm shitposting. This question has nagged at me for a very long time, and I just wonder why this debate exists to begin with.

DebateEvolution,4yks1j,aNewMe2,,t2_ullnv,self.DebateEvolution,,ID and Evolution,"Since my last post didn't go over so well I will try again, but be more upfront with my beliefs.

I believe in Intelligent Design. I believe a supernatural being created the earth and very basic lifeforms on it. Then started the process of evolution causing these basic lifeforms to evolve into the millions and millions of different species of plants and animals that we have today. However, when mankind reached its latest (and in my opinion, last) stage of development, the creator for the most part, shut down the evolutionary process.

This is evident as we have a rich fossil history proving evolution, but we have nothing showing large scale speciation in the last 200,000 years. Why has evolution basically slowed down since then? Why isn't there a long list of species that have emerged in this time? If you look at the vast majority of species of vertebrates, you can see their species emerged a long, long time ago, hundreds of thousands of years. No one can provide me a sizable list of new-ish vertebrate species. Everyone always falls back to plants and insects. They get angry, they call me names, they say its not far for me to exclude plants and insects.  Well, sorry, but within my belief system it absolutely is fair to exclude them.

So heres the challenge, I will admit I am 100% wrong and there is no God if anyone can come up with a list of 15 non-plant, non-insect species of animals that have emerged in the last 100-200k years. I will only count **good examples** and I promise not to quibble and exclude any that meet my criteria: 

* Non-plant
* Non-insect
* Is fully speciated, no examples of animals that have started the process, but are not considered a new species
* Subspecies do not count! Wolves and Domesticated dogs are still C. Lupus, they are still the same **species**
* If you can provide the classification names, I have no way to complain about the example


I feel that 15 is a fair requirement, there are millions of species of animals, surely if evolution is still happening on these creatures, we can find a mere 15 examples in hundreds of thousands of years?",47,1471634956,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4yks1j/id_and_evolution/

DebateEvolution,4xynwp,lapapinton,,t2_ij6nn,self.DebateEvolution,,Circular reasoning in evolution? (x-post /r/Creation),"There’s a wonderful volume titled “Galileo goes to Jail and other Myths about Science and Religion” published by Harvard University Press, and one of the ""myths"" is “That the theory of organic evolution is based on circular reasoning”, authored by Nicolaas Rupke.

Rupke himself is an interesting person: he is currently a historian of science, but initially trained as a geologist and was also a Young-Earth Creationist in his younger years. Alas, he lost his faith when he entered Princeton University’s doctoral program in geology. His essay deals with both the geological column and homology, but this post concentrates on the latter.

Here’s a section from Rupke’s essay:

“In Icons of Evolution (2000), [Jonathan] Wells discusses “why
much of what we teach about evolution is wrong.” One of the
“icons” he cites, conventionally used as proof of evolution, is
the phenomenon of homology. “But what precisely is homology?”
Wells asks. Under the heading “Homology and circular
reasoning,” he explains that evolutionary biologists define the
term as the similarity between different species that is due to
their shared ancestry. In other words, homology indicates evolution
and evolution produces homology — a perfect “circular
argument.

“*Consider the example of bone patterns in forelimbs, which Darwin
regarded as evidence for the common ancestry of the vertebrates.
A neo-Darwinist who wants to determine whether vertebrate
forelimbs are homologous must first determine whether they [the
species being compared] are derived from a common ancestor. In
other words, there must be evidence for common ancestry before
limbs can be called homologous. But then to turn around and argue
that homologous limbs point to common ancestry is a vicious circle:
Common ancestry demonstrates homology which demonstrates
common ancestry.*”

It becomes no easier for the Darwinists—Wells maintains—
when they turn to the fossil record to help determine evolutionary
relationships. *“Unfortunately, comparing fossils is no more
straightforward than comparing live specimens... Any attempt
to infer evolutionary relationships among fossils based on
homology- as- common- ancestry ‘soon leads to a tangle of circular
arguments from which there is no escape.’ ”*

Some evolutionists have talked back in an effort to absolve
themselves from the sins of chasing their tails. But this has
proved no easy matter. Creation scientists aren’t fools and,
**strictly speaking, do have logic on their side in the major cases
cited here.** Moreover, they have been able to amass quotations
from concerned evolutionists who apprehensively admit to the
illogical practices of which they stand accused. Quite likely,
a variety of paleontologico- stratigraphical studies are unreliable
because they are founded on a petitio principii (the logical fallacy
of “begging the question”).

All the same, the assertion that evolution is crucially based on
circular arguments is a myth.""

(citations removed, my bolding)

Rupke goes on to discuss how the term “homology” was originally coined by Richard Owen, an English anatomist, in his book “On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton”. For Owen, a homologue was defined as “The same organ in different animals
under every variety of form and function.”, which Owen, as an old-earth creationist, interpreted as evidence of a repeated divine design. Rupke also notes that Owen later began to become more open to a theistic evolutionary view point.

Rupke also discusses how Darwin himself took these observations about vertebrate skeletons, and argued that they were characteristics derived from a common ancestor. Darwin argued in the 14th chapter of the Origin of Species that, for example, because there is no functional reason for the pentadactyl limb to be shared by humans moles, horses, porpoises, bats, therefore it was better explained by descent with modification. 

My comment: I think Rupke is correct insofar as, even if you have some disagreements with it, you can follow the structure of Darwin’s argument concerning vertebrate skeletons, and the argument itself certainly isn't circular.

However, I think the problem lies in that we have examples of biologists using both definitions of the term “homology”, creating a circular argument.

Jonathan Wells remains correct in calling this out.

DebateEvolution,4vnvpt,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,How Sex Evolves,"The evolution of sexual reproduction is a perpetual sticking point for creationists. Commonly framed as along the lines of, “how did the first female reproduce without any males?” or “sex couldn’t have evolved because it would requires males and females to appear at the same time,” these objections completely miss the robust understanding we have of the evolution of sexual reproduction.

&amp;nbsp;

Before we get to the how, let’s cover the why. So why have sex? Jokes aside, there are a lot of downsides – high energetic cost, high search cost (have to find a mate), can be dangerous, more susceptible to disease, sexual selection lead to detrimental traits, there are a **lot** of reasons why sex would be selected against. But it allows for greater genetic variation within a population. It does this through allowing for recombination between individuals, which allows for different allele combinations to appear more rapidly than in asexual populations. So you can combine beneficial alleles, or decouple a beneficial allele from a detrimental one, much more rapidly than in the absence of sexual reproduction.

&amp;nbsp;

This is primarily beneifical under two sets of conditions. First, when the environment changes rapidly or conditions are unfavorable, there is an enormous advantage to being about the shuffle the deck and try to generate a new genotype, which might be better suited to the present conditions. We see this is paramecium, which can reproduce sexually and asexually, and tend to do the former in hostile environments. 

&amp;nbsp;

Second, sexual reproduction is beneficial in the context of complex interactions between different organisms, especially antagonistic relationships, such as that between a host and parasite. Both organisms are constantly imposing selective pressures on and adapting to the other, and the flexibility conferred by sexual recombination allows for the maintenance of a stable relationship, rather than one participant “winning” and the other “losing.” This is often described as the [Red Queen hypothesis,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) named for the scene in “Through the Looking Glass.”

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s the why. Now how does that happen? It starts with a simple truth: Under many conditions, recombination confers a fitness advantage. In more ancestral organisms, bacteria and archaea, this can be accomplished by taking up exogenous DNA and incorporating into your own genome – the process of *transformation*. Some types of bacteria can do this directly, particularly when certain plasmids are present, via the process of *conjugation*. More broadly, we can group these processes together under the umbrella of *horizontal gene transfer*, the movement of genetic material between individuals in a population or in different populations.

&amp;nbsp;

Since they’re more complex, eukaryotes have a number of different way of accomplishing the same thing. Some unicellular organisms can just fuse, recombine, and divide under adverse conditions. Some filamentous green algae, like [spirogyra,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Spirogyra.JPG/1280px-Spirogyra.JPG) can line up in parallel, and adjacent cells can fuse. They then divide to return to a haploid state, swapping alleles along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some species have developed *mating types*, which are distinct forms that cannot mate with each other. For example, [chlamydamonas](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/studies/invertebrates/invertimages/chlamy.gif) has mt(+) and mt(-) types, and they can only mate with each other, but two mt(+) types cannot mate. Why should this happen? Well recombination is most effective when it’s between two very different individuals. If two very similar individuals mate, the likelihood of generating novel combinations of alleles is quite low. Having mating types promotes the mixing between more different individuals, and should therefore be selected for. In this example, we don’t yet have male and female, since the cells that fuse, the *gametes*, are not different between the two types.

&amp;nbsp;

In this situation, different strategies can emerge – put very little energy into many offspring, or put a lot of energy into very few. Selection can favor one or the other in the different mating types, leading to a divergence in gamete morphology. Individuals that make many, but put little E into each are males, individuals that make few with a high E investment are females. That’s the distinction between simple mating types and true sexes – differentiated gametes. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, true sexual reproduction exists, but we’ve only discussed unicellular organisms. It’s not too different in multicellularity, except that with more complexity, you can have selection acting on different aspects of the process, biased operational sex ratios, the ratio of breeding males to breeding females at any given time, can lead to things like sexual selection and sexual dimorphism.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll just finish up with a quick look at two organisms that demonstrate these dynamics: Paramecium and bdelloid rotifers. [Paramecia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Paramecium.jpg/610px-Paramecium.jpg) are unicellular ciliates and can reproduce asexually via [binary fission](http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca/ftp/biodidac/protista/ciliopho/photo/olih023p.gif) or sexually via [conjugation](http://bio1903.nicerweb.com/Locked/media/ch28/28_11bParamecReprod_2-L.jpg) (a very complicated process, not the same conjugation as described above). Generally, they are asexual, but when food is scarce or conditions hostile, they will conjugate. 

&amp;nbsp;

The [bdelloid rotifers](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/micropolitan/fresh/rotifer/philodina.jpg) are extremely interesting because they appear to be a rare example of a very ancient asexual lineage of animals. Rather than sexual reproduction, they have other mechanisms for fighting parasites and generating novel allelic combinations. They can dry out, killing any parasites, then rehydrate and go on their way. They also have weird genomes described as “degenerate tetraploid,” that is, they have four copies of their genome, but no one copy is complete. Instead, they have two incomplete sets of two copies each, and there can be intra-genomic recombination and gene conversion to increase diversity. In other words, they’ve evolved other mechanisms to accomplish the same things that sexual reproduction does in most organisms. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s a quick look at the evolution of sexual reproduction. There’s a lot more to talk about here (I didn’t even mention genome duplication!), but this is a good introduction and should help dispel some of the misunderstandings surrounding how sex could have appeared in the first place.",4,1470074959,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4vnvpt/how_sex_evolves/

Dr. Mary Schweitzer reported^(1) that her tests indicate that dinosaur bone cell DNA is present in her fossil samples. Dr. Schweitzer's work utilized markers that would detect certain DNA sequences, and the DNA fragments had to be at least dozens of base-pairs long in order to indicate DNA presence. But in the same year, 2012, [another study](http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555)^(2) determined that the half-life (the time it takes for half of the bonds in the DNA to spontaneously break down) is 521 years at 13.1°C. The breakdown is due to many factors, the most significant of which is hydrolysis due to the ""almost ubiquitous"" presence of groundwater. But 52 million years would be 100-thousand half-lives! To put this in perspective, even if there were as many base-pairs as there are particles in the universe, they would all break down in only 300 half-lives!

Also in 2012, another study^(3) stated:

&gt; However, even under the best preservation conditions at –5°C, our model predicts that **no intact bonds** (average length = 1 bp [base pair]) will remain in the DNA ‘strand’ after 6.8 Myr. This displays the extreme improbability of being able to amplify a 174 bp DNA fragment from an 80–85 Myr old Cretaceous bone. [my emphasis]

Number 3: Creationists and Junk DNA

Lately there has been quite a surge of people debating the amount of functionality of DNA.

[Example of long discussion, not even a day old.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4uhgxu/failed_evolutionist_predictions/d5ram9w)

How much of our DNA is junk DNA? Is ""junk"" DNA an old term? How much of our DNA is ""functional"", and how do we even define functionality. What did ENCODE find out?

Those are all interesting questions, however, this post is **not** going to be about those topics, mainly because I want to highlight the reason why creationists seem to be absolutely fascinated by the findings of ENCODE and why creationists will always fight by the teeth to defend any notion that would imply that all of our DNA is functional.

&amp;nbsp;

The reason is really simple: If our DNA is fully functional, it would be an advantageous talking point for creationists because it shows the ""perfection"" of nature and our genetic information. If there is non-functional DNA in our bodies, that would be an ""imperfection"".

That is the only shallow reason why you'll always find a bigger amount of creationists wanting to prove that our DNA has a lot of unforeseen function compared to the relative amount of biologists etc. Yes, it's that obvious.

&amp;nbsp;

However, nature is imperfect and evolution leaves it's prints in our DNA. Endogenous retroviruses leave prints in our DNA and thus are likely non-functional. A lot of other animals have extremely varying amounts of DNA even if not being of the same complexity, pointing towards a lot of DNA not being functional in any way.

But regardless, to make my post similar to my previous ones, here are some points to consider:


2. No, it is not an unexpected or recent discovery that a pretty big portion of our DNA has biochemical activity. Also, it has long been known that some noncoding DNA has important functions. (This was known even before the phrase ""junk DNA"" was coined.)

1. No, 100% of our DNA being functional does not validate creationism anyway. You can argue your whole life and hope that we find out that even more of our DNA is functional, but that will never be an actual problem for biologists.


I find it absolutely strange that so many creationists will chime in with arguments like:

""Scientists were wrong about junk DNA.""

""ENCODE found out that 80% of our DNA has biochemical functions.""

And I just fail to understand what they want to prove with that? Why is it always creationists bringing up ENCOD as if that somehow was a counter argument to evolution??

&amp;nbsp;

Does it even shine trough to creationists that most wouldn't care even if we found out that 100% of our DNA is functional? Which, by the way, is very very likely never going to be true. There is [good evidence](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html) that much DNA has no function:


- Sections of DNA can be cut out or replaced with randomized sequences with no apparent effect on the organism (Nóbrega et al. 2004).

- Some sections of DNA are corrupted copies of functional coding DNA, but mutations in them, such as stop codons early in the sequence, show that they cannot have retained the same function as the coding copy.

- The fugu fish has a genome that is about one third as large as its close relatives.

- Mutations in functional regions of DNA show evidence of selection -- nonsilent changes occur less often that one would expect by chance. In other sections of DNA, there is no evidence that any changes are selected against.

DebateEvolution,4ugmh0,angeloitacare,,t2_olzgm,self.DebateEvolution,,The argument of a intelligent designer required to setup the Metabolic Networks for the origin of life.,"The argument of a intelligent designer required to setup the Metabolic Networks for the origin of life. 

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2371-how-cellular-enzymatic-and-metabolic-networks-point-to-design

Observation: The existence of metabolic pathways is crucial for molecular and cellular function.  Although bacterial genomes differ vastly in their sizes and gene repertoires, no matter how small, they must contain all the information to allow the cell to perform many essential (housekeeping) functions that give the cell the ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis, reproduce, and evolve, the three main properties of living cells. Gil et al. (2004)  In fact, metabolism is one of the most conserved cellular processes. By integrating data from comparative genomics and large-scale deletion studies, the paper ""Structural analyses of a hypothetical minimal metabolism""   proposes a minimal gene set comprising 206 protein-coding genes for a hypothetical minimal cell. The paper lists 50 enzymes/proteins required to create a metabolic network implemented by a hypothetical minimal genome for the hypothetical minimal cell. The  50 enzymes/proteins , and the metabolic network, must be fully implemented to permit a cell to keep its basic functions.  
Hypothesis (Prediction): The origin of biological irreducible metabolic pathways which also require regulation and and which are structured like a cascade, similar to electronic circuit boards,  are best explained by the creative action of an intelligent agent.
Experiment: Experimental investigations of metabolic networks  indicate that they are  full of nodes with enzymes/proteins, that require for their synthesis information rich, language-based codes stored in DNA . Hierarchical structures have been proved to be best suited for capturing most of the features of metabolic networks (Ravasz et al, 2002). It has been found that metabolites can only be synthesized if carbon, nitrogen, phosphor, and sulfur and the basic building blocks generated from them in central metabolism are available. This implies that regulatory networks gear metabolic activities to the availability of these basic resources.  So one metabolic circuit depends on the product of other products, coming from other, central metabolic pathways, one depending from the other, like in a casacade.  Further noteworthy is that Feedback loops have been found to be required to regulate metabolic flux, and the activities of many or all of the enzymes in a pathway.  In many cases, metabolic pathways are highly branched, in which case it is often necessary to alter fluxes through part of the network while leaving them unaltered or decreasing them in other parts of the network (Curien et al., 2009). These are interconnected in a functional way, resulting in a living cell. The biological metabolic networks  are  exquisitely integrated, so the significant alterations in  inevitably damage or destroys the funcion. Changes in flux often require changes in the activities of multiple enzymes in a metabolic sequence. Synthesis of one metabolite typically requires the operation of many pathways.
Conclusion:   Regardless of its initial complexity, self-maintaining chemical-based metabolic life could not have emerged in the absence of a genetic replicating mechanism insuring the maintenance, stability, and diversification of its components. In the absence of any hereditary mechanisms, autotrophic reaction chains would have come and gone without leaving any direct descendants able to resurrect the process. Life as we know it consists of both chemistry and information.   If metabolic life ever did exist on the early Earth, to convert it to life as we know it would have required the emergence of some type of information system under conditions that are favorable for the survival and maintenance of genetic informational molecules. ( Ribas de Poupkna, Ph.D.)
    Intelligent agents have frequently end goals in mind, and use high levels of instructional complex information to met the goal. In our experience, systems storing large amounts of specified/instructional complex information through  codes and languages -- invariably originate from an intelligent source.  Likewise, circuits or networks of coordinated interaction as for example  of analog electronic devices can always be traced back to a intelligent causal agent. The operation of analog electronic devices maps very closely to the flow of information in chemical reactions of metabolic pathways (McAdams and Shapiro, 1995). A proposed mechanism to make metabolical networks  must be capable of construct de novo, not merely modifying, a minimal set of 50  enzymes, and complex integrated metabolic circuits with the end goal  to create life. A metabolic network that is not fully operational, will not permit life.  We know in our experience that intelligence is able to setup  circuit  boards, like discrete electronic boards, and is the  only known cause of irreducibly complex machines. Since evolution depends on metabolic circuits fully setup,  its excluded as possible mechanism. The only two alternatives, chance/luck or physical necessity have never been observed to be able to setup circuit boards and irreducible complex systems.

DebateEvolution,4t6r4g,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Medicine validates evolutionary mechanisms, Part 2: Gaining, losing, and predicting antibiotic resistance","Today we’re talking about antibiotic resistance, and how it’s appearance, loss (or retention), and predictions of antibiotic genotypes validate evolutionary theory. I want to make very clear: If evolutionary theory was incorrect, we would not observe these processes as we do, and we would not be able to make accurate predictions about them. 

&amp;nbsp;

So the process for acquiring antibiotic resistance is pretty simple. You have a population of bacteria that harbors a fair amount of genetic diversity. Through more-or-less random mutations (and some other processes, but we’ll stick with mutations today), some members of that population gain antibiotic resistance, which I’ll abbreviate “AR” from here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Most of the time, AR carries a cost. This is called **antagonist pleiotropy**, meaning a single mutation has multiple effects, some good (AR), and some bad (e.g. grow more slowly). So most of the time, in the absence of antibiotics, the cells with AR are selected against, and consequently any one AR mutation is not maintained in the population. However, because there are often many ways to achieve AR, there are often some AR individuals present in the population. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once antibiotics are present, the dynamics change. AR provides a clear fitness advantage, and over time, only AR individuals will remain. This is where it gets interesting. Since in the absence of antibiotics, AR is a net negative, we’d expect mutations that cause the *loss* of AR to occur, and for non-AR individuals to take over again. But this is rarely observed. How?

&amp;nbsp;

Well, the AR individuals don’t stop evolving after one mutation. They continue to experience mutations, and some of them are beneficial *when they occur with an AR mutation*. These mutations are called **compensatory mutations**, because they, you guessed it, compensate for the deleterious effects of the AR mutation. To illustrate this with arbitrary numbers, when there are no antibiotics present, the original individuals might have a fitness of 10 (arbitrary units), AR individuals a fitness of 5, and AR+compensatory (abbreviated AR+C going forward) individuals a fitness of 8 or 9, or even 10. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since the AR population continues mutating and evolving, they often find these compensatory mutations, and these second mutations prevent the loss of AR even once the drugs are removed. Why? There is no pathway back to a non-resistant genotype favored by selection. AR+C can lose either the AR or C mutations (this is called *reversion*, when a mutation reverts back to the ancestral state), but that intermediate is worse than AR+C, whether the antibiotics are present or not. That means those individuals would be selected against, making it unlikely that enough of them stick around long enough to find the second reversion to restore the non-resistant genotype. And that’s assuming just two mutations in the pathway. AR often involves more than that. There’s a name for this well-documented mechanism: The lobster trap model of antibiotic resistance, and it’s the reason that once AR appears, it’s almost never lost. 

&amp;nbsp;

But it’s not all bad. We can use our knowledge of these dynamics to predict what genotypes we expect to see when a bacteria is introduced to a new antibiotic. There have been several experiments in which bacteria were exposed to and allowed to evolve resistance to a specific drug. The mutations present in the resistant bacteria were determined, and then each was evaluated for it’s fitness effects, alone and in combination with each of the others. In one of these experiments, there were five mutations required for the strongest resistance phenotype, but of the 120 possible pathways from 0 to 5 mutations, only a few resulted in an increase in the degree of AR at each step, meaning those are the genotypes we’d expect to see as the bacteria gains resistance. 

&amp;nbsp;

This can allow us to predict what genotypes we expect to see when a new drug is introduced clinically, and we’ve actually done so successfully. This kind of work led to the discovery of two previously unknown resistance mutations to a drug called cefepime. Within three years, one of those mutations was clinically isolated, just as was expected. We were able to make that prediction based on the experimentally determined fitness associated with each AR mutation. 

&amp;nbsp;

So to wrap this up, none of this would work if evolutionary mechanisms as we understand them were not operating. AR wouldn’t spread, it wouldn’t be maintained even after treatment, and we wouldn’t be able to predict what resistance mutations will appear after a drug is introduced. But all of those things do happen. 

So my questions are twofold. First, does anyone dispute the basic mechanisms at work here? Second, if evolutionary mechanisms *aren’t* driving these processes, what is, and what evidence do you have for this alternative?

Problem no.1
The genetic code system ( language ) must be created, and the universal code is nearly optimal and maximally efficient

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8335231
The genetic language is a collection of rules and regularities of genetic information coding for genetic texts. It is defined by alphabet, grammar, collection of punctuation marks and regulatory sites, semantics.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3293468/
In our opinion, despite extensive and, in many cases, elaborate attempts to model code optimization, ingenious theorizing along the lines of the coevolution theory, and considerable experimentation, very little definitive progress has been made.
Summarizing the state of the art in the study of the code evolution, we cannot escape considerable skepticism. It seems that the two-pronged fundamental question: “why is the genetic code the way it is and how did it come to be?”, that was asked over 50 years ago, at the dawn of molecular biology, might remain pertinent even in another 50 years. Our consolation is that we cannot think of a more fundamental problem in biology.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732450
The genetic code is one in a million 
if we employ weightings to allow for biases in translation, then only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the natural code. We thus conclude not only that the natural genetic code is extremely efficient at minimizing the effects of errors, but also that its structure reflects biases in these errors, as might be expected were the code the product of selection.

Problem no.2

The origin of the information to make the first living cells must be explained.
http://mmbr.asm.org/content/68/3/518.full.pdf
Determination of the Core of a Minimal Bacterial Gene Set Based on the conjoint analysis of several computational and experimental strategies designed to define the minimal set of protein-coding genes that are necessary to maintain a functional bacterial cell, we propose a minimal gene set composed of 206 genes ( which code for 13 protein complexes ) Such a gene set will be able to sustain the main vital functions of a hypothetical simplest bacterial cell with the following features. 
These protein complexes could not emerge through evolution ( muations and natural selection ) , because evolution depends on the dna replication, which requires precisely these original genes and proteins ( chicken and egg prolem ). So the only mechanism left is chance, and physical necessity. 

Paul Davies once said;

How did stupid atoms spontaneously write their own software … ? Nobody knows … … there is no known law of physics able to create information from nothing.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103513000791?np=y

Genomic DNA is already used on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity, but stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible mapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying the code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological timescales; in fact, it is the most durable construct known. Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far from being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally cannot be ruled out.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832087/?report=classic
DNA sequences that code for proteins need to convey, in addition to the protein-coding information, several different signals at the same time. These “parallel codes” include binding sequences for regulatory and structural proteins, signals for splicing, and RNA secondary structure. Here, we show that the universal genetic code can efficiently carry arbitrary parallel codes much better than the vast majority of other possible genetic codes. This property is related to the identity of the stop codons. We find that the ability to support parallel codes is strongly tied to another useful property of the genetic code—minimization of the effects of frame-shift translation errors. Whereas many of the known regulatory codes reside in nontranslated regions of the genome, the present findings suggest that protein-coding regions can readily carry abundant additional information.

Problem no.3
The genetic cipher
The British biologist John Maynard Smith has described the origin of the code as the most perplexing problem in evolutionary biology. With collaborator Eörs Szathmáry he writes: “The existing translational machinery is at the same time so complex, so universal, and so essential that it is hard to see how it could have come into existence, or how life could have existed without it.” To get some idea of why the code is such an enigma, consider whether there is anything special about the numbers involved. Why does life use twenty amino acids and four nucleotide bases? It would be far simpler to employ, say, sixteen amino acids and package the four bases into doublets rather than triplets. Easier still would be to have just two bases and use a binary code, like a computer. If a simpler system had evolved, it is hard to see how the more complicated triplet code would ever take over. The answer could be a case of “It was a good idea at the time.” A good idea of whom ?  If the code evolved at a very early stage in the history of life, perhaps even during its prebiotic phase, the numbers four and twenty may have been the best way to go for chemical reasons relevant at that stage. Life simply got stuck with these numbers thereafter, their original purpose lost. Or perhaps the use of four and twenty is the optimum way to do it. There is an advantage in life’s employing many varieties of amino acid, because they can be strung together in more ways to offer a wider selection of proteins. But there is also a price: with increasing numbers of amino acids, the risk of translation errors grows. With too many amino acids around, there would be a greater likelihood that the wrong one would be hooked onto the protein chain. So maybe twenty is a good compromise. Do random chemical reactions have knowledge to arrive at a optimal conclusion, or a "" good compromise"" ?  

An even tougher problem concerns the coding assignments—i.e., which triplets code for which amino acids. How did these designations come about? Because nucleic-acid bases and amino acids don’t recognize each other directly, but have to deal via chemical intermediaries, there is no obvious reason why particular triplets should go with particular amino acids. Other translations are conceivable. Coded instructions are a good idea, but the actual code seems to be pretty arbitrary. Perhaps it is simply a frozen accident, a random choice that just locked itself in, with no deeper significance. 

That frozen accident means, that good old luck would have  hit the jackpot  trough trial and error amongst 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes . That is the number of atoms in the whole universe. That puts any real possibility of chance providing the feat out of question. Its , using  Borel's law, in the realm of impossibility.  The maximum time available for it to originate was estimated at 6.3 x 10^15 seconds. Natural selection would have to evaluate roughly 10^55 codes per second to find the one that's universal. Put simply, natural selection lacks the time necessary to find the universal genetic code. 

Put it in other words : The task compares to invent two languages, two alphabets, and a translation system, and the information content of a book ( for example hamlet)  being written in english translated  to chinese  in a extremely sophisticared hardware system. The conclusion that a intelligent designer had to setup the system follows not based on missing knowledge ( argument from ignorance ). We know that minds do invent languages, codes, translation systems, ciphers, and complex, specified information all the time.  The genetic code and its translation system is best explained through the action of a intelligent designer.

DebateEvolution,4rs07n,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Medicine validates evolutionary mechanisms: Vaccines wouldn’t work if evolutionary theory was invalid.,"We don’t need to look at the past or even experimental evidence to see that evolutionary theory is valid. We can simply look at efforts to prevent disease, and processes that occur as the result of medical treatments, vaccines specifically. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m going to discuss “live attenuated” vaccines. These are vaccines composed of live viruses that are “attenuated,” mutated or deficient in some way, and so unable to cause a clinical infection (i.e. unable to make you sick). 

&amp;nbsp;

If evolutionary theory was invalid, we wouldn’t be able to make and then use live attenuated vaccines, because the process takes advantage of naturally occurring mutations and selection for variants that are *worse* at infecting humans. How does that work?

&amp;nbsp;

First, the virus in question has to be isolated. Then it is grown for many generations in non-human cell cultures in a process called passaging. For example, the Sabin polio vaccine (one of several, but the important one in the 20th century, which is now being phased out) is a live attenuated vaccine composed of polio viruses grown on monkey kidney cells. During this time, mutations appear. Normally, when the virus is infecting humans, most of the mutations will be detrimental. But some of them are adaptive (i.e. beneficial) when infecting monkey cells, and selection acting on the population of viruses growing in those cells favors the new variants. 

&amp;nbsp;

An important point here is that evolution often involves trade-offs. It’s rare for one virus, for example, to be equally good at infecting multiple hosts, compared to viruses specific to each host. Going back to polio, the mutations that help the viruses infect monkey cells make them worse at infecting humans. So after a sufficient number of passages (the number varies based on the specific type of vaccine), the now attenuated viruses can be purified and used as the basis for a vaccine. When a person is given the vaccine, those viruses try to infect their cells, but they are not as good at doing so compared to “normal” polio (or influenza, or whatever pathogen you’re dealing with), so the immune system has plenty of time to recognize the invaders and mount a robust defense. Now, if that person is exposed to wild-type (non-attenuated) polio, they will have the antibodies and cells ready to defeat it before it can make them sick.

&amp;nbsp;

This process, the production and use of live attenuated vaccines, relies on the processes of mutation and selection to generate a strain of virus that has adapted to an alternate host. Importantly, that host must be similar enough to humans that the virus can still infect human cells after passaging, but different enough that selection for the alternate host imposes a fitness cost when the new strain infects humans. If evolutionary theory was invalid, this process would not work. Therefore, two centuries of vaccination validate evolutionary theory. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that’s not the end. We need a new flu vaccine every year, and if evolutionary theory was invalid, that wouldn’t be the case. Why do we need a new flu vaccine every year? Why can’t we just figure out one that will last? Stupid scientists. 

&amp;nbsp;

We need a new flu vaccine (actually three) every year because of *strain replacement*. The whole point of the flu vaccine is to target the most common strains in a given year, to prevent them from circulating at a high rate. So for example, say you have four strains: A, B, C, and D. The vaccine targets A, B, and C, which combine for about 90% of the influenza population (I’m making numbers up to simplify how it works, but that’s the gist – you target the common strains). At the beginning of the flu season, it’s A/B/C at 90%, D at 10%. But the vaccine is effective, and enough people get it that it generally works, so by the end of the flu season, D is up to 80% of all cases. 

&amp;nbsp;

That happens because of evolutionary mechanisms. The vaccine imposes a selective pressure against strains A/B/C, so D (and other, novel variants) increases in frequency while the others decrease. And next year, that vaccine is ineffective not because it wouldn’t work anymore, but because its targets have been selected out of the population. It’s one of the ironies of flu vaccination: The more effective the vaccine and successful the vaccination campaign are in a given year, the less effective that vaccine will be the next year. Thanks, evolution.

&amp;nbsp;

 So for these reasons, vaccination does not just *support* evolutionary theory, but *validates* it, as in, if evolutionary theory was invalid, these things would not be the case. Attenuated vaccines would not work. We would not need a new flu vaccine every year. Therefore, evolutionary theory is valid.

DebateEvolution,4qo4k1,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Generating Novel Genetic Information via Gene Duplication,"One of the most common objections to evolutionary theory is that there is no mechanism through which new genetic information can be generated through mutation and selection. The idea is that mutations tend to be deleterious (detrimental), and that you can’t change a gene too much or you lose its functionality, even if it does something else. So the chances of finding a new function while preserving the old are too small for evolutionary mechanisms to generate novel genetic information (i.e. new functions). 

&amp;nbsp;

This is completely wrong. We know how genetic information can increase. I’m going to discuss one general mechanism and describe a couple of examples, but there are other mechanisms and processes we could also discuss. Basically, claiming that you can’t generate new genetic information is indicative of either unfamiliarity with basic genetics and evolutionary biology, or straight up dishonesty. 

&amp;nbsp;

The basic mechanism I’m going to discuss is gene duplication followed by divergence, selection, and specialization. 

&amp;nbsp;

Gene duplication is an extremely common phenomenon. We see evidence of it in every genome, from prokaryotes to mammals. There are several mechanisms, but most involve some kind of unequal crossing over or recombination. During recombination, two pieces of matching DNA line up and swap equal parts, which leads to new combinations of alleles. This is one of the primary reasons why sexual reproduction is favored in many organisms, especially under adverse conditions (origins of sex: another fun topic). 

&amp;nbsp;

Recombination doesn’t always work perfectly. Since there are only so many combinations of nucleotides, and most genomes contain similar or repeated regions, unequal crossing over is fairly frequent. This occurs when the two DNA molecules don’t line up correctly; one is offset along the other. [This leads to the gain of DNA on one side and the loss on the other.](http://web.pdx.edu/~newmanl/UnequalXover.gif) Now, that loss is usually problematic for the cell that get’s that chromosome, but the gain may or may not cause a problem. 

&amp;nbsp;

If the gain doesn’t cause a problem, the cell[s] with that chromosome now have an extra copy of any genes in the duplicated region. This what allows for a new function to evolve

&amp;nbsp;

One copy of the gene in question is constrained; it must maintain its original function in order for the organism to survive. The other copy is not constrained; it experiences relaxed selection. Mutations can occur without impacting the fitness of the organism. Often, those mutations will inactivate the gene and it will become a pseudogene. But they may also lead to a slight change in the protein structure, allowing it to bind or act on a different substrate, or participate in a different pathway, for example. 

&amp;nbsp;

These changes may be deleterious, beneficial, or neutral. If they’re beneficial, selection will favor the organisms with them, and over time, the population will have a higher proportion of individuals with that new function. In other words, new genetic information will have appeared within a population. The very thing that creationists say can’t happen. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are lots of examples of gene families that originated this way, but I’m going to briefly describe two, one somewhat small scale, one extremely large scale. 

&amp;nbsp;

On the smaller scale, we have the globin family of proteins in animals. These are proteins involved in oxygen transport – hemoglobin and myoglobin. Based on the sequence similarity between the genes of this family (myoglobin, alpha hemoglobin, beta hemoglobin), we can trace them backwards to a single gene that is the common ancestor of all three (actually more, but three main ones). So these are homologous genes – genes that share a common ancestor. [Myoglobin was the first to diverge, then the two types of hemoglobin diverged from each other more recently.](http://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Globin_gene_evolution_2.gif) This most probably occurred via successive gene duplication events, as I described above. 

&amp;nbsp;

The larger scale example is Hox genes. Hox genes are developmental control genes found in animals. They control large-scale developmental patterns, and are found in clusters. [Arthropods \(insects and their relatives\) have one hox cluster in their genomes, mammals have four hox clusters, Some fish may have six.](http://www.trinity.edu/klivings/3421-F07/buswold_john_1.jpg) The interesting thing here is that the individual hox genes of the original cluster probably arose through sequential gene duplication; one gene became two, became four, etc. But the clusters probably arose through sequential *genome* duplication; one cluster becomes two, becomes four. If you sequence the hox genes, you find homologous genes within each cluster *and between clusters*. As expected, you also find pseudogenes – genes that lost their function after duplication. One cluster might have 13, another just nine. It’s a beautiful example of the power of gene duplication and mutation to generate novel genetic information and increase biological complexity. 

&amp;nbsp;

Creationists, if this process *isn’t* at work, what's your explanation, and why is it better?

DebateEvolution,4pqicn,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,Human Chromosome 2 Strongly Supports the Common Ancestry of Chimps and Humans,"One of the strongest single pieces of evidence for evolution in general, and the common ancestry of humans and chimps specifically, is the structure of the human and chimpanzee genomes. I don't mean the % that is identical between the two, I mean the actual number, size, and structure of the chromosomes themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

Humans have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs: 1-22, plus XX or XY. Chimps have 48 chromosomes in 24 pairs, and every chimp chromosome exactly matches a human chromosome in size and banding pattern, with the exception of human chromosome 2. You will not find a chromosome in the chimpanzee genome that looks like human chromosome 2.

&amp;nbsp;

As you might expect, there are 2 chimp chromosomes that don't have a match in the human genome. Those two go by different names - sometimes 12 and 13, and sometimes, for reasons I'll discuss, 2A and 2B, or 2P and 2Q. I've seen all three ways. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, a bit on chromosome structure. There are several distinct regions that each chromosome has. At either end, you have a distinct sequence called a telomere. In the middle, you have a centromere. All chromosomes have two telomeres and one centromere. The nucleotide sequences of telomeres and centromeres are highly conserved, and easily recognizable. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you look at human chromosome 2, you see exactly what you would expect: Telomeres at either end, a centromere in the middle. But if you look more closely, you see something interesting: The remnants of two telomeres, back-to-back, smack in the middle of the chromosome. And not far away, the remnants of a no-longer-used centromere. 

&amp;nbsp;

If you line up the two renegade chimp chromosomes with human chromosome 2, you can see exactly what happened: Chromosomal fusion. Two chromosomes fused into one. The no-longer-used telomeres and centromeres were able to mutate without harming the organism, and slowly drifted away from their specific, tightly-controlled sequences, but slowly enough to still be recognizable in human chromosome 2. 

&amp;nbsp;

The sequencing of the human and chimp genomes was a great test of evolutionary theory. If we share a common ancestor, the genomes should be very similar, and there should be explanations for any major differences. That was a testable prediction. If we found genomes that were completely dissimilar, that would have been a problem for common ancestry. Instead, they're extremely similar, and there was a crystal-clear explanation for the only major difference. Hypothesis supported. 

&amp;nbsp;

How does creation offer a better explanation for these observation? Or, what testable predictions does creation make regarding the common ancestry of humans and other apes?

Philip Johnson, Dembski, Behe, Meyer, Discovery Institute, etc. That's the ID I'm talking about. 

Original post:
This came up in another thread, and I think it’s important enough that it deserves it own.

Intelligent design is creationism. Period. The intelligent design movement was an effort to circumvent the 1987 Edwards v. Aguillard decision from the Supreme Court, in which the Court ruled that teaching creation science was a violation of the Establishment Clause. There’s lot’s of evidence for this claim, so I’m going to describe just a few of the critical pieces, focusing on “Of Pandas and People,” the intelligent design textbook ([if you can call it that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0_utZaJUL0)). ""Of Pandas and People"" was the title of later editions. Originally, it was called “Creation Biology.”

&amp;nbsp;

Between the different versions, very little changed. Really, the big difference was the replacement of all references to creation and creationism with discussion of design, a designer, etc. And when I say replacement, I mean replacement. Here’s the definition of of creation from the pre-Edwards 1987 edition:

""Creation is the theory that various forms of life began abruptly, with their distinctive features already intact: Fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers and wings, mammals with fur and mammary glands.""

&amp;nbsp;

And here’s the definition of intelligent design from the post-Edwards edition from later in 1987:

DebateEvolution,4o1tms,TheBlackCat13,,t2_n7ruj,self.DebateEvolution,,For ID Proponents: The SETI Challenge,"This is a challenge directed at those who accept ID.  In particular, it is directed at those who believe ID is a useful technique for determining whether something was designed by an intelligence.

It is often claimed by ID proponents, including in [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4fdz4t/intelligent_design_quick_tutorial_and_ama/d2945a5) that SETI would benefit from using ID techniques.  The idea is that using ID techniques would allow SETI to find signals it currently can't.

So here is a chance for ID proponents to show what ID can do.  I will create 10 signals, one of which contains useful information, the other 9 don't.  The signals will be a sampled analog signals containing a digital signal encoded in an unknown manner.  To show that ID has benefits over current SETI approaches, the signal will be a broadband signal using an encoding not typically used on Earth.  

I will know which one is the signal, how it is encoded, and what it is encoding, but you won't.  I will verify that the digital data is recoverable from the signal, but ID proponents will not be required to actually recover the data, only identify which analog signal contains the data.

The issue, though, is that I don't know what is and is not possible with ID.  So I ask that ID proponents describe specifically what sort of constraints they require on the analog signal, encoding scheme, and digital signal in order to allow them to identify it.  Things like number of samples, number of bits in the digital signal, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.  Note that this is supposed to simulate detecting intelligent design from a species we know absolutely nothing about, so specifying a particular encoding scheme, signal bandwidth, or digital sequence is not allowed.

Please show your work, such as including any equations or code you used to do the analysis.

Once I have some idea what I should create, I will create the 10 signals then edit this post to include them.  

**Note**: This thread is *not* an endorsement if ID.  On the contrary, it a challenge directed at them (hence the title). More specifically, it is an attempt to get ID supporters to justify one of their claims that I so far have not been able to get them to provide any specifics about.  Whether ID is science is certainly a valid debate but it is outside the scope of this thread. I would also like to avoid a semantic debate about the definition of ID.

DebateEvolution,4nnwam,DarwinZDF42,,t2_khqp5,self.DebateEvolution,,"Abiogenesis via the RNA World. Creationists, can you do better?","Here’s a plausible scenario for abiogenesis. How is your alternative better, Creationists? 

&amp;nbsp;

Before I get into the nitty-gritty, a couple of notes. First, this is **one** scenario, based on the RNA World hypothesis, which posits that RNA was the first self-replicating molecule and genetic material, with proteins and DNA coming later. Second, and this is critical, each step of this process has been observed in the laboratory setting. Third, the experiments that have modeled these processes did not involve any design input into the sequences of the RNA molecules nor the arrangement of the fatty acid structures involved. So don’t pull a “well the scientists designed everything so this is design/creationism.” Setting the conditions and/or selective pressures is not the same thing as designing the molecules. 

&amp;nbsp;

That all being said, here’s how life could have started. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, you have the spontaneous formation of small organic molecules. Among these are RNA nucleotides and fatty acids. You also get amino acids, but we’re going to ignore those. (If you we’re talking Protein World hypothesis, you’d focus on those and ignore the RNA at first.) This has been observed in more recent and comprehensive versions of the Miller-Urey experiment. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once you have your RNA nucleotides, they can self-assemble into oligonucleotides of dozens to hundreds of bases long. This process has been observed under conditions that are likely to have existed on a young earth. Specifically, certain types of volcanic clays, such as montmorillonite, have been shown to catalyze RNA polymerization. Given these materials and heat, polymerization occurs. 

&amp;nbsp;

Montmorillonite also greatly accelerates the assembly of fatty acids into hollow spheres called liposomes. Importantly, liposomes are a hallow ball composed of a phospholipid bilayer, which is the primary structural component of cell membranes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, the really interesting thing here is that you can when you put these three things (RNA nucleotides, fatty acids, montmorillonite) together, you get liposomes with RNA polymers inside them. So we have structures that look like cells. But that’s only part of the puzzle.

&amp;nbsp;

A critical component of this theory is the ability of RNA molecules to catalyze reactions. These molecules are called ribozymes. The ribosome is the best known example of a ribozyme. There are ribozymes that can self-replicate under the right conditions. They can make a copy of themselves, then cleave the new copy from the old, resulting in two identical molecules. The spontaneous appearance of functional RNA sequences has been well-documented experimentally, going back to the early 90’s. These experiments used a process called in-vitro evolution to generate random RNA oligonucleotides, then select for the ones that could do some function – bind to something, replicate, cleave, whatever. Then they are improved by successive rounds of sloppy copying – introducing mutations – and further selection. 

&amp;nbsp;

So to summarize thus far, you can spontaneously get ribozymes in liposomes under early-earth conditions. And each part of this process has been observed experimentally. And here’s where it gets interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

If you have active self-replicating ribozymes in liposomes, those liposomes will grow. As RNA nucleotides are assembled by active ribozymes, that changes the osmotic balance between the inside and outside of the liposome, causing water to flow inward. This puts pressure on the liposome to expand, and as a result, liposomes housing self-replicating ribozymes grow by taking up free fatty acids from the environment **and** by stealing them from non-growing liposomes (i.e. liposomes that do not contain active ribozymes). 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to pause right here to point out an extremely important component of this process: Selection. This process – growing due to osmotic pressure and stealing lipids, or shrinking due to a lack of change in osmotic pressure – is positive selection acting on self-replication. So once it appears, self-replicating sequences will increase in frequency, while non-replicating sequences will decrease. This is **critical**, as it is the first step in this process in which a specific property of life (replication) is selected for. All of the other things happened through physical processes and chance. 

&amp;nbsp;

So you have selection for self-replication and liposomes growing. But they cannot grow indefinitely. Once a liposome gets too big to be stable, it splits in two. Now instead of having one large liposome containing a mix of free nucleotides and self-replicating ribozymes, you have two smaller ones. This process has been observed in the lab, and results in surprisingly little loss of the internal contents back out into the environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

These structures, liposomes containing actively self-replicating ribozymes, are called protocells. They grow and divide, they contain genetic information that can copy itself, and they have an internal environment that is both separate and different from the outside environment. However, they are **not** cells. They do not carry out metabolism, and both the self-replication of their RNA and the growth and division of the protocells is driven by purely physical forces, not what we would recognize as cellular energetic pathways. But they are darn close to cells, and the incorporation of amino acids was probably the next big step in the process. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some objections:

Chirality: Self-replication appeared in molecules of one chirality first (randomly), and that dictated what chirality monomers would be incorporated from then on. 

Never been observed from start to finish: That would take too long. Each step has been modeled, which is realistically as much as you’re gonna get. 

RNA to DNA transition: RNA and DNA can hybridize (i.e. form base pairs), and there are examples of stable DNA-RNA hybrids that you can find today (e.g. some viral genomes). DNA is more stable (i.e. mutates more slowly) than RNA, so using DNA for storage instead of RNA would be favored by selection in some (but not all) circumstances. 

Appearance of proteins: Yup, to my knowledge, we don’t really know, so you can use this objection if you’re comfortable using an argument from ignorance. 

RNA mutates too fast - error catastrophe: It actually doesn't. Only the fastest-mutating RNA viruses exist near the error catastrophe threshold. RNA viruses and some single-stranded DNA viruses **may** be susceptible to error catastrophe via chemical mutagenesis, but the evidence is ambiguous. It's just not as big a problem as it's made out to be. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that’s a quick overview of the RNA world hypothesis. It is a plausible pathway from organic monomers to macromolecules to protocells. Remember, **there is experimental evidence for each step in this process**. It is by no means certain nor complete, but it is a robust theory with extensive experimental support. 

&amp;nbsp;

For creation to be a better theory than the RNA world, it must demonstrate **more** support, and must be shown to be **more plausible**, than the RNA world hypothesis. Creationists: Can you provide a better alternative?

Prayer works but scientists don't want to face this, so they exclude god. Richard Dawkins said that evolution is a tool by atheists.

The main point is, mutation rates are so alarmingly high that humans could only have existed for about 6000 years more or less. Mutations accumulate way to fast so we only just had the time to survive until now (after we disembarked from the ark).
The same can be said about the mutations of evil prokaryotes. Shit, there are way too many! I researched how many years we could have possibly endured this. More or less 600 years, the math checks out.

Atheists scientists found some human bones but since the Piltdown man was a known fraud (atheists scientists working under methodological naturalism didn't question the piltdown fossil because it debunked adam and eve) we can easily disregard the human fossil record.

The second law of thermodynamics and information theory tells us that for the universe to have contained all the information at t=0 there need to exist an infinite amount of universes. Since the multiverse theory is debunked, we can only assume that all the information was *not* there from the beginning of the universe, which obviously debunks common descent somehow and further proves creation.

With intelligent design, we can infer *tentatively* that something is supernatural. Hence whenever we see something we can't quite explain, we can infer ID theory (the law I made up) so for example, ATP synthase is clearly intelligently designed (since we don't know how it evolved) so it was tentatively created.

[NOTE: This is not merely a theological rant, but rather an analysis of the foundations of the presupposition of [Methodological Naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_%28philosophy%29#Methodological_naturalism).]

The atheist [Norwood Russel Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood_Russell_Hanson) [wrote](http://enoch2112.tripod.com/MurrayDivHid.htm):

&gt; ... 'God exists' *could* in principle be established for all factually—it just happens not to be, certainly not for everyone! Suppose, however, that next Tuesday morning, just after breakfast, all of us in this one world are knocked to our knees by a percussive and ear-shattering thunderclap. Snow swirls; leaves drop from the trees; the earth heaves and buckles; buildings topple and towers tumble; the sky is ablaze with an eerie, silvery light. Just then, as all the people of this world look up, the heavens open—the clouds pull apart—revealing an unbelievably immense and radiant-like Zeus figure, towering above us like a hundred Everests. He frowns darkly as lightening plays across the features of his Michelangeloid face. He then points down—*at me!*—and explains, for every man and child to hear: 'I have had quite enough of your too-clever logic-chopping and word-watching in matters of theology. Be assured, N.R. Hanson, that I most certainly do exist.'

You may be inclined to dismiss this as a playful, irreverent Disney-oid contrivance, due to the literary devices that Hanson employs, such as specifying that it occur ""next Tuesday morning, just after breakfast."" But Hanson adds:

&gt; ... Please do not dismiss this as a playful, irreverent Disney-oid contrivance. The conceptual point here is that *if* such a remarkable event were to occur, I for one should certainly be convinced that God does exist. That matter of fact would have been settled once and for all time... That God exists would, through this encounter, have been confirmed for me and for everyone else in a manner every bit as direct as that involved in any non-controversial factual claim.

Similarly, atheist [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins) [stated](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3044365-the-god-delusion), ""If all [all? *ALL*? does *ALL* the evidence turn in favor of evolutionism? I think not!] the evidence in the universe turned in favour of creationism, I would be the first to admit it, and I would immediately change my mind. As things stand, however, all available evidence (and there is a vast amount of it) favours evolution.""

I can't find the direct quote and so must paraphrase, but atheist [Bertrand Russel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) was once asked, ""If you are wrong, and you come before God after your death, what question would you have for Him?"" He replied, ""Why didn't you clearly reveal yourself?"" ...I'm sure Russel's actual retort was far more eloquent than my memory of it.

I could supply similar quotes by other eminent atheists such as Hume and Nietzsche. By making such statements, they are acknowledging that certain evidences in this natural world could definitively establish the facthood of God's existence, if only they occurred, but which they claim do not.

---

###There is a problem here...

... the problem is Methodological Naturalism (MN)!

Whether a person is a Philosophical Naturalist or not, anyone who employs MN when observing and analyzing the natural world cannot, by presupposition, find a shred of the evidence of the kind that the above atheists claim would convince them of God or His creation.

As the judge in the [Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District) case opined in his *Memorandum Opinion*:

&gt; Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science.

""[S]upernatural explanations may be important and have merit""? What does that mean? Does that mean that they may be **true**? If it doesn't, then it is meaningless gibberish. If it does, then that implies that any naturalistic explanation for that phenomenon is **false**, and science based on such a presupposition leads to false evidences, analyses and conclusions.

If the thinkers referenced above base their science on MN, which I'm sure they would acknowledge, then it is not possible for them to arrive to the conclusions to which they claim they would arrive; but if, on the other hand, they would dispense with MN when making their analyses, then they are not in accordance with the stated scientific presupposition of MN. They are stuck in a paradox.

###There is a solution! 

But first, let us examine the problem that MN attempts to address.

At times, science has operated under two dogmatic principles that impeded its progress:

* **Once a supernatural cause is attributed, the analysis is final.** This is not in keeping with good science, which is and should always be tentative.

* **If a phenomenon cannot be understood, then it is assumed to have a supernatural cause.** Hence all the attributions of eclipses, earthquakes, thunder, etc. to the supernatural. This makes supernatural attribution nothing more than a ""catch-all"". This is no good; however, it would not impede science, as long as the first dogmatic principle is not followed. My objection to this principle is that it dilutes the claim of supernatural agency, causing many to overlook the significance of proper inferences to the supernatural.

But, what is it about the phenomenon that Hanson describes that makes him accept it as from God, in spite of his presumably MN presuppositions?

I posit that it is because the phenomenon exudes Intelligent Design!

Although I find that atheists invariably demand spectacular, incontrovertible, even personal-in-your-face evidence, the essence of the evidence is that it undeniably originates from a non-natural intelligent agent. In Hanson's example, he demands that God call him out, *by name*, in the presence of all mankind; is Hanson willing to stand by patiently as God personally calls out the other seven billion earthlings? If God were to allocate a mere ten seconds to each of His human creatures, it would take twenty-thousand years for Him to address all mankind; in fact, there are over two births per second, so God would be continuously falling further behind. Clearly, Hanson is setting the bar much higher than is necessary, or even reasonable. Nevertheless, his example, which he says is sincere, demonstrates that even the hardest-core atheistic Methodological Naturalist will overlook his MN presuppositions in the face of sufficient natural evidence of a certain kind.

And what kind is that? In Hanson's case, the evidence he would find convincing doesn't violate any natural law, except one: the law of probability. All the phenomena *could happen*, it's just extremely, extremely improbable. But that is the essence of ID theory evidence—it exhibits great complexity, and thus high improbability. Now, it would be possible to use such evidence to invalidate the law of probability, but it makes more sense, in light of the message that this improbable phenomenon presents, to simply accept it as a *supernatural* violation of probability—that is, a miracle.

###My suggestion:

I suggest that we (scientists and mere observers of nature) recognize that there are theoretically possible situations in which we observe violations of established natural laws, but which do not warrant a claim that those laws have been ""naturally"" violated. Note that the laws are *natural*, and thus are not violated when a supernatural cause is operational.

I see two situations in which a natural law could appear violated, but in which it is more reasonable to infer supernatural agency than to claim that the natural law is no longer a law:

* Situations in which the laws of probability are violated, but where also a message is attached that explains the violation. Now, I am going to give a concrete example, but I ask that you focus on the application of this principle, and not on peripheral issues. Rather than describe a detailed scenario of my own imaginings, I simply offer the ten plagues on Egypt described in The Bible's book of Exodus, chapters 7-12. Now, wait! I am not expecting you to believe this story is true: there certainly is the possibility that this is a mere myth. And please don't ask me what kind of god would inflict this kind of misery on a people; that is a discussion for another time. Just consider whether you would believe your lying eyes if this apocalypse were happening around you, and all sensory inputs were in consensus in reporting that this is really happening. I see it as being similar to the scenario Hanson constructs.

* Situations where the three criteria of Intelligent Design are clearly operating. You may not be convinced by any example provided by ID theory advocates, but we are looking first at the principle itself. If, in principle, ID theory provides a possible reason to invoke supernatural agency, then we can revisit and see if any such evidence actually has been discovered. If it doesn't, then you need to explain what it is about Hanson's scenario that permits invocation of a supernatural explanation (if you accept Hanson's proposition). For an extreme example of ID evidence, consider whether you would infer supernatural causation if scientists discovered the Book of Genesis encoded in our DNA.

###Conclusion

As I say, if you agree with Hanson that the scenario he describes would warrant abrogation of MN and attribution of supernatural agency, then tell me whether you think my suggested modification to MN would be reasonable.

If you don't accept Hanson's scenario, then offer your own scenario that would hypothetically provide evidence of supernatural agency. If you can't do this, then you must accept my accusation that you are *a priori* closed-minded to the possibility of the supernatural, as I claim that Bertrand Russel is.

DebateEvolution,4n4jik,maskedman3d,,t2_3g1na,self.DebateEvolution,,Incompetent Design,"Numerous creationists and intelligent design advocates say life and the universe are intelligently designed, but it seems the opposite is true.

&amp;nbsp;

First let us look at the big, **BIG**, picture. The universe as a whole. What do we see? Radiation, which will kill us. Freezing temperatures, which will kill us faster than the radiation. The vacuum of space, which will kill us way before the freezing cold of space will. And if you are near a star or happen to fall into an atmosphere, extreme heat that will kill you way faster than the vacuum of space... if you are lucky. The vast majority of the universe is empty space, so we are also alone and cut off from nearly everything, other than light and radio waves that come from outside our solar system.

&amp;nbsp;

Then there is the galaxy, which is hurtling toward another galaxy, which will result in the destruction of both and the formation of a new one in a few billion year(again because the universe is so huge and lonely). The many stars in which are held in place by the gravity(both one of the most important forces and yet one of the weakest forces) of a super massive black hole. Anything not eventually consumed by that black hole will probably be flung off into the void of space.

&amp;nbsp;

Speaking of black holes, all the solar systems in all the galaxies are orbiting stars. Stars are slow burning nuclear bombs of epic proportions which will either burn out, freezing their planets and any life near by, or(the more likely option) will go supernova and burn many planets before eventually collapsing into the black hole and sucking in all near by matter and energy.

&amp;nbsp;

And yet, if certain religions are right all of this is just to show off the glory of a god, to show us how cool and powerful it is... great job buddy, gold star.

&amp;nbsp;

What about on the planetary level? the vast majority of our planet is uninhabitable for the most intelligent form of life, the form of life which the universe was supposedly created expressly to support the existence of. It is covered in water, most of which we can't drink unless we first invent a way to remove all the salts from it. Even then the land masses are unstable, with earthquakes and volcanoes. Even if you find a suitable and stable bit of land you have to hope there isn't a fire, or flood, or tornado, or hail storm, or freezing cold temperatures, or extraordinarily hot temperatures that will harm and possible kill you.

&amp;nbsp;

But what about being alive? Well if you aren't able to make your own food out of sunlight, which there is such an abundance of it is possible to develop cancer because of the exposure to it, you have to find other things to consume in order to stay alive. It is a kill or die world. And if you are a ""prey"" form of life you are still unlucky enough to experience terrible pain the entire time you are being killed for food. If you are a ""predator"" form of life you have to fight for food, and the sometimes the right to mate, possibly risking you own life in both instances.

&amp;nbsp;

Although even if you are lucky enough to mate you will still die of old age. Or an illness. Or an accident. No matter how good, or smart, or strong, or fast you are, your body will eventually fail and you will cease to be.

&amp;nbsp;

But before you die, if you are human(which you probably are because you are reading this) you will suffer numerous troubles. Things such as having a blind spot in your vision, suffering back pain because standing upright is bad for your body, knee injuries because again, bad design. The entire time you are alive you will have to fight off bacterial and viral infections, because those exist(for some messed up reason, allegedly). And sometimes the immune system that protects you turns on you and attacks your body instead. You will have to put up with optical illusions because your brain and eyes are easily fooled. You might even be unlucky enough to become addicted to harmful substances, hooray! That is if you are lucky enough to be born in part of the world where is it normal to survive childhood. And that is assuming you aren't born with some debilitating diseases or deformity that will cut your life short.

&amp;nbsp;

Also you might be too lucky and have an unlimited supply of food which can lead to diabetes or cardio vascular disease. That is if don't randomly have a brain aneurysm for no reason.

This mutation rate is only important in germ cells--the cells that go on to become the offspring of the parents. Muller estimated in 1950^(1) that error catastrophe would be a certainty if the mutation rate were any higher than 1 mutation per offspring. Shortly after DNA and its role in heredity were discovered, geneticists estimated, based on observations, that the mutation rate was in the order of 0.12 to 0.3 mutations per offspring^(2). If this low rate of mutation generation--once every 3-6 generations--were true, I would still argue strongly that it is too high for humans to remove by selection, since, as you will see later, it takes longer than that to eliminate what are called ""very slightly deleterious mutations"" (VSDMs). But I won't bother at this point, because the situation has been found to be much worse than this!

In 1986, the mutation rate was alarmingly reported^(3) to be 30, two orders of magnitude higher; the authors opined that such a high number would have ""profound"" implications. More recent research puts the mutation rate higher still, at 100^(4) or 175^(5).

Evolution defenders still held out hope though, because it was thought that only a small portion, perhaps 5%, of the genome held useful (transcribed) information; the rest was labeled ""[junk DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA#Junk_DNA)"", a label that creationists immediately criticized. But if true, that would mean that only 1/20 of mutations were significant. This idea, and the ""junk DNA"" label as well, were effectively put to bed by the [ENCODE project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE)'s findings, published in 2007. Wikipedia summarizes by saying, among other shocking results:

&gt; The human genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases are associated with at least one primary transcript and many transcripts link distal regions to established protein-coding loci.

&gt; Many novel non-protein-coding transcripts have been identified, with many of these overlapping protein-coding loci and others located in regions of the genome previously thought to be transcriptionally silent.

The ""junk DNA"" portion of the genome is becoming vanishingly small, and based on results up to now, we should expect it to continue to shrink. Basically, ""junk DNA"" is the moniker we place on DNA whose function has not yet been identified. In fact, much of the DNA has been found to transcribe *in both directions*, a property that makes DNA practically impossible to alter advantageously through point mutations.

But wait. We've only considered point mutations up to now.

There are mitochondrial mutations. Since the [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) comprises only 16,569 base pairs, the number of mtDNA mutations is estimated to be less than one per offspring. Yet one evolutionist commented^(6),

&gt; ""We should increase our attention to the broader question of how **(or whether)** organisms can tolerate, in the sense of evolution, a genetic system with such a high mutational burden.""

Then there are insertions, deletions and duplications^(4), of which there can be several per offspring. But since they operate on multiple base pairs each, the number of affected BPs can be substantial.

There are also inversions, translocations and conversions, for which I couldn't find numbers.

So, in summary, humans can conservatively be said to suffer hundreds of deleterious mutations **per offspring!** You have hundreds more deleterious mutations than your parents, and triple that number than your great-grandparents. How could they not be placing an unbearable burden on natural selection to remove? As a young-earth creationist, I claim that we have only been ""devolving"" (evolving downhill) for some hundreds of generations. In a millions-of-years scenario, how could we not be extinct by now?^(7)

There is a great many more problems with long-term human evolution, but I'll have to do more posts. The bed beckons.

DebateEvolution,4lj690,No-Karma-II,,t2_ya3uo,self.DebateEvolution,,Thinking Like an Evolutionist,"I was born in, grew up in, and even went to university in, one of the most leftist, anti-conservative cities in America: Madison, Wisconsin. I attended twelve years of public school there, and you can be sure that I was taught the most refined evolutionary dogma available.

I particularly remember encountering evolutionary explanations in biology class for the intricate mating displays and dazzling colors of male members of many species, especially [birds](https://youtu.be/wTcfDCjBqV0), but also many [mammals](https://youtu.be/Ez7RUSCUhzk?t=64) and even [spiders](https://youtu.be/d_yYC5r8xMI?t=79).

The explanation given was that the female made the mating decision, and she did it on the basis of the spectaularity of the male's coat and dance. Of course, the brightest coat, with the most vivid colors, and the most animated dance won the day, and the male's vitality was closely correlated to the brightness of his coat, so  this ensured that the healthiest male passed on his genes.

But consider, for example, [this peacock feather](http://imgur.com/i9hhwEM). Does the peahen actually care about the fine nuances in this cock's feather? The iridescent colors--caused not by pigments, but by complex thin-film wave interference--does the hen care? How about the three ellipsoids, framing a cardoid, whose geometries require that individual barbs change among multiple spectacular colors with high precision, and the stem terminate at the center of the cardoid--does the hen care? Or that each of the [200 or so feathers](http://imgur.com/wFpvvn9) do not radiate from a single point, but yet position themselves evenly and radially as though they do--does then hen care? If she does, how do [white peacocks](http://imgur.com/4RJBO3M) manage to mate? Notice that of the 200 feathers, about 170 are ""eye"" feathers and the other 30 are ""T"" feathers that beautifully frame the eye feathers in an [ogee curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogee)--does the hen care? [Notice](http://imgur.com/kKLvwsJ) the cock's back, bespeckled with tiny radiant nascent eyes framed in black, set off by the iridescent blue breast, throat and topnotch, with a dozen feathers, naked along their length, but each topped with a little pom-pom--does the hen care? And the black eyes, hidden in a black streak, enveloped above and below by white streaks--does the hen care?

Some evolutionist researchers recently set out to answer at least a subset of these questions. They measured tail lengths and number of ""eyes"" on the fans of numerous peacocks, and rated the cocks based on these indicators of ""quality"". They then collected evidence from 268 matings over a seven-year period. Although not intending to pop evolutionist bubbles, their findings were very disheartening.^(1,2,3,4) They found no correlation between their indicators for cock ""quality"" and mating success! I guess the hen doesn't care.

But there are even more serious porblems with this explanation, and until I was freed from evolutionary encumberances, I could not see them.

Most significantly, we know that there exists an ""evolutionary budget"" for mutations. If an organism is selecting for multiple characteristics, each characteristic's selection rate is reduced proportionately. That is, the sum of all selection rates is a constant. So, if an organism is under severe selection pressure to create beautifully shaped and arranged iridescent feathers and a topknot, it must do so at the expense of other critical objectives, such as eliminating harmful mutations, adapting to changing environmental conditions and developing other novel features that enhance survivability in the contests against other organisms.

Also, why does the hen choose the cock? If she chooses him, what ensures that the best genes are transmitted from her? Why don't they simply do as rats and rabbits do: mate with whomever they encounter. Let their ability to show up for mating be their metric for survivability. This I think, would be the mate selection methodology that evolution would favor.

The  duplication of eukaryotic cells is a all fine-tuned biochemical processes that depends on the precise structural arrangement of the cellular components. Mitotic cell division is the most fundamental task of all living cells. Cells have intricate and tightly regulated machinery to ensure that mitosis occurs with appropriate frequency and high fidelity.

The only way to make a new cell is to duplicate a cell that already exists. A cell reproduces by performing an orderly sequence of events in which it duplicates its contents and then divides in two.  This cycle of duplication and division, known as the cell cycle, is the essential mechanism by which all living things reproduce. Dividing cells must coordinate their growth. A complex network of regulatory proteins  trigger the different events of the cycle. 

During the cell cylce, eighteen different regulators are required, which order and coordinate the process. Each of these regulators are absolutely essential. If one is missing, the cell cycle is not completed and, the cell cannot duplicate.  Any of these regulators have only use if fully integrated in the process. They have no use or function by themself. This makes  replication a irreducible , interdependent process.

Centrosomes play a key role in organizing the microtubule network of the cell, most notably the mitotic spindle during cell division .

The choreography of microtubules, centrosomes and chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis is beautifully designed, and uses finely regulated and synchronized movements.

The centrosome is a structure, consisting of a pair of cylindrical microtubule-based organelles called centrioles , embedded in an amorphous network of proteins known collectively as Pericentriolar Material (PCM). Microtubules (MTs) originate from the PCM.  The PCM comprises a porous structural scaffold onto which γ-tubulin and other soluble components from the cytoplasm are loaded. Centrosome growth is an aggregation process of a condensed phase of PCM components, which segregate from the cytosol. The aggregation process leads to a centrosome phase that coexists with the cytosol and does rearrange internally. This implies that the centrosome phase is viscoelastic, such that on long timescales it behaves as a liquid-like material.

Cep192 is a pericentriolar protein that accumulates at centrosomes during mitosis and is required for PCM recruitment, centriole duplication, microtubule nucleation, and centrosome maturation.

Centrioles are among the most beautiful of biological structures. How their highly conserved nine-fold symmetry is generated is a question that has intrigued cell biologists for decades.
Centrioles are present in all eukaryotic species that form cilia and flagella, but are absent from higher plants and higher fungi which do not have cilia.
It seems likely that they have  the primary purpose of growing cilia and flagella, which are important sensory and motile organelles found in almost all cells of the human body.  These organelles have many important functions in cells, and their dysfunction has been linked to a plethora of human pathologies, ranging from cancer to microcephaly to obesity.  Great progress has been made recently in understanding how these proteins interact and how these interactions are regulated to ensure that a new centriole is only formed at the right place and at the right time.

Centriole biogenesis requires thirteen essential molecules. If any of these molecules is missing, centrioles cannot be made. 

Centriole assembly is also tightly regulated and abnormalities in this process can lead to developmental defects and cancer. Initiation of centriole duplication is under tight regulation to ensure the control of centriole number. Presumably in centriole initiation, there is some form of cooperativity or positive feedback that results in asymmetric accumulation of the relevant proteins in a symmetric background.

So we have not only the requirement of eighteen proteins required for cell cycle regulation, but also thirteen essential molecules for centriole biogenesis, which by itself is also tighthly regulated, requiring positive feedback.

It appears at the initial stage of the centriole assembly process as the first ninefold symmetrical structure. The cartwheel was first described more than 50 years ago, but it is only recently that its pivotal role in establishing the ninefold symmetry of the centriole was demonstrated.  This is a highly ordered structure that really stands out from the background. Constructed of rod-like microtubules, most centrioles have a nine-fold pattern, nine triplets or doublets evenly spaced at the rim, giving it a ""cartwheel"" appearance in cross-section. 

The comparison to a human made cartwheel is evident, and so that it is intelligently designed. Obviously, the question arises, how could all this emerge gradually ? 

Another amazing fact is that Electromagnetics play an important role in cell functioning and especially in cell duplication and division (mitosis).

Recent development in the field of quantum biology highlights that the intracellular electromagnetic field (EMF) of microtubules plays an important role in many fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis. It is an intriguing hypothesis that centrosome functions as molecular dynamo to generate electric flow over the microtubules, leading to the electric excitation of microtubule EMF that is required for spindle body microtubule self-assembly. With the help of motors proteins within the centrosome, centrosome transforms the energy from ATP into intracellular EMF in the living cell that shapes the functions of microtubules. There will be a general impact for the cell biology field to understand the mechanistic function of centrosome for the first time in correlation with its structural features.



The electromagnetic property of microtubule has been reported with both computation modelling and experimental evidences.

To transform the chemical energy in ATP into electric magnetic field within the living cell, cell needs to have a molecular dynamo to transform the mechanistic movement of protein complexes to directional movements of intracellular electrons, leading to the electric excitation of the spindle body microtubules as well as the M phase chromosomes, which is essential for mitosis

Taken together the longitudinal, or axial, vibration of the 13 filaments of an MT and then the 27 MTs making up the centriole barrel produce the electromagnetic field surrounding the centriole . Interestingly, this field is also found to be ferromagnetic. Also of interest, the fundamental vibration frequency of an MT filament is approximately 465 MHz, although this frequency is continually changing due to the ongoing length changing of the filaments. The electropolarity of the centrioles enables them to exert forces at a distance—that is, forces without physical contact.

All this cannot leave us asounded and v   indicates the requirement of forsight to produce all these ingenius mechanisms,and subsequently a intelligent designer.

DebateEvolution,4kmddb,No-Karma,,t2_x794e,self.DebateEvolution,,Information Theory tells us that life could not have evolved.,"Just about everyone is aware of the fact that the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) (SLoT) places some severe and disappointing constraints on the universe we inhabit. First, we know that we are all doomed to die, even if we were to conquer sickness and aging, or even if we become computer states *à la* the Matrix, because the universe will eventually run out of usable energy, called ""[heat death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)"". Second, it is not possible to build a [perpetual motion machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion); all useful mechanisms increase the entropy of the universe, hastening the aforementioned heat death. The only good news is that heat death is billions of years in the future.

Frequently, creationists argue that the SLoT says that we are going downhill, which is the opposite direction that evolution says we are going. Evolutionists counter that the SLoT is only valid for a *closed system* (which is true) and the earth's biosphere is an open system, constantly receiving fresh low-entropy energy from the sun. Nevertheless, the creationists are correct, but it is not the objective of this article to argue that point (so please don't comment on it).

Rather, I want to examine the implications of Information Theory on evolution.

Regarding [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information), Wikipedia states that:

&gt; Information resolves uncertainty. The uncertainty of an event is measured by its **probability of occurrence** and is inversely proportional to that [probability]. The more uncertain an event, the more information is required to resolve uncertainty of that event. The [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) is a typical unit of information, but other units such as the [nat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_%28unit%29) may be used. [emphasis mine]

In Wikipedia's article on the ""[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)"", it states:

&gt; In information theory, one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal **probability**, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known. [emphasis mine]

Notice that the amount of information in a message is related to **probability**; information is defined by its **probability**. The more information in a message, the lower its **probabilty**.

In fact, in Wikipedia's article on [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory), it states:

&gt; Shannon [[Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_E._Shannon), the Bell Labs researcher that penned the seminal paper on information theory in 1948] discovered that the proper choice of function to quantify information, preserving this additivity [discussed earlier], is logarithmic, i.e.,

&gt;     I(p) = log(1/p)

where I is the information contained in a message, and p is the **probability** that the message can occur. If the logarithm is to the base 2, then the information I is measured in bits.

---

Now, let's think a little about what probability is: it is the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging in value from 0 to 1 inclusive, where p=0 means it *cannot* occur, p=0.5 means there is a 50% chance it will occur, and p=1 means it *must* occur.

But one interesting corollary of this is: a system that is currently in a low-probability state will tend to migrate over time to higher-probability states, when undirected influences are acting on the system. After all, this is really what it means for an event to be ""probable"". For example, say you have a box containing four pennies, all ""heads"". If you shake the box softly so that a few coins are jostled, the coins will gravitate towards a 50-50 ratio of heads to tails. This is because there are more ""ways"" to get a 50-50 mixture than any other ratio. As Pascal described in his treatise on [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle) (by the way, Pascal was a Christian creationist, who also gave us [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager)),

* For 0 heads, p = 1/16 (TTTT)
* For 1 heads, p = 4/16 = 1/4 (TTTH, TTHT, THTT, HTTT)
* For 2 heads, p = 6/16 = 3/8 (TTHH, THTH, THHT, HTTH, HTHT, HHTT)
* For 3 heads, p = 4/16 = 1/4 (THHH, HTHH, HHTH, HHHT)
* For 4 heads, p = 1/16 (HHHH)

The above is row 4 of Pascal's triangle.

But there is a specific relationship between an event (or ""message"") and the amount of information it conveys, given by the logarithmic relationship stated above. As the probability of an event increases, the amount of information decreases.

Now, there exists a stunning similarity between thermodynamic entropy, H, and information theory entropy, S. So much so, that Wikipedia devotes a [separate article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory) to its discussion. Notice that both H and S are functions of the probabilities of the microstates of their respective systems (please refer to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory), since mathematical notation cannot be easily represented in Reddit's [Markdown Language](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)). There are only two minor differences: first, H is customarily calculated using the natural logarithm (base ε) and S is customarily calculated using base 2. However, this is only custom, and changing the base of the logarithm simply changes the logarithm by a constant factor. In fact, information can be calculated base ε, resulting in information expressed in [nats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_%28unit%29) instead of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). The second difference is another constant factor in H: the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), which, being a constant, also does not impact the comparison being made here.

The point is this: just as thermodynamic entropy never decreases, so information theory entropy never decreases. If we take the ""closed system"" being considered in both cases to be the entire universe, this means that:

* the total useful energy in the universe is ""leaking out"", and will eventually be totally lost; and
* the total information in the universe is ""leaking out"", and will eventually be totally lost.

It also means that:

* it is impossible to add useful energy to the universe; and
* it is impossible to add information to the universe.

Now, if we can agree that DNA contains information, this leads to the astounding conclusion that the universe had to contain *more* information at its creation than will ever exist in the universe thereafter! We can say one thing, even if we can't agree on DNA: if there was no information in the universe at t=0, there never would be any information in the entire universe at any time thereafter.

But DNA *does* contain information. As the Wikipedia article on [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) clearly and unequivocally states, ""DNA stores biological information."" And that amount of information is COLOSSAL. There is enough information in all the DNA of all the various living organisms to specify not only the current state of all those organisms, but how to manufacture every single organism ""after its kind"". And there was more information in the past, to specify all the organisms that have since gone extinct.

And the information isn't just in the DNA. Every cell is improbable, because it is *living*. There are far, *far*, FAR more states that the molecules in every living cell could be in that do not have the special characteristic of imparting life. This is why we can puncture the wall of a cell, thus killing it, but we have never succeeded in ""un-puncturing"" the cell and restoring life to it. Loss of information is a one-way street, and unless huge amounts of external information are inserted, death cannot be undone (though Goodness knows, we've tried).

Irreducible complexity keeps being a unsurmountable problem for the ones that propose unguided evolution and natural mechanisms to explain  the origin of life and biodiversity in general. No attempt to refute and successfully debunk the argument has been brought forward so far. Eyery attempt, no exception, has failed. Why ? Because IC is a undeniable FACT, no matter what. And this FACT becomes obvious to the unbiased mind  when we envision biological systems as complex molecular machines, that operate similar to man made machines, but far far more complex. Individual parts have no function by themself. This is a important point to highlight. What use does the wing of a airplaine  have alone? None. The engineer has to envision a function for the wing, used as essential part of the design of the airplane as a whole in order to fly, and its use once the airplane is fully built with all parts in place.  The wing must be made with the right specifications, size, materials, form, and placed and mounted at the right place in the right way. And the wing itself requires complex machines to be made. The right materials must be transported to the building site. Often these materials in their raw form are unusable. Other complex machines come into play to transform the raw materials into usable form.  All this requires specific information.   The precise same thing happens in biological systems. Even the most simple cell useses inumerous parts, that have no use by their own. For what reason would natural mechanisms create these parts , if there were no use for them individually ? This is a problem that stretches through all biology, from the simplest to the most complex. Biological systems do only achieve specific tasks, once a number of individual parts are made upon  specific complex instructions, frequently through other specific machines or even factories and assembly lines, that have no other tasks than to build these specific parts, and all this through the instructions of the  blueprint in the genome, and then other specific instructions provide the information of how, when , and where to mount the parts to form the complex machine. Same as done when building human made machines. And all these processes must be strictly controlled, with error check and feedback mechanisms, and if something is not build upon the right specification, complex repair machines fix the problem. These checking and repair systems must be fully operational from day one, otherwise, the organism dies. And energy in usable form must also be provided ,and the make of energy requires also complex machinery which by itself requires energy to be made ( chicken-egg problem ). Furthermore, internal and external communication networks must be established.  Also all these machines are made to self replicate , which adds a hudge amount of further complexity into the picture. Self replication is far from simple. It demands the most complex molecular machinery, which works in a astonishing , beautyful, orchestrated , regulated and controlled manner. Why at all would natural unguided, non-intelligent chemical reactions have the need to produce living biological systems, and keep them existing through self replication?",33,1463923891,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4kik3m/irreducible_complexity_is_a_undeniable_fact/

He claims he's an actual biologist with a degree who ""is working with RNA in a lab"".

I am getting quite annoyed by his claims, but I wanted to know what you guys think about this. Especially for people who are geneticists, or know enough about genetics:


&gt; Why? Do you think there's some knockout evidence for evolution they must've gone over in one of my classes?

&gt; The claimed evidence for it you hear isn't any different from what you hear everywhere else when it comes down to it.

&gt; &gt; how come that you studied to get that degree while not accepting evolution, the backbone of biology?

&gt; How's evolution the backbone of biology? I'd think the backbone of biology would be chemistry, if anything.

&gt; Right now for example, our project is looking at how certain proteins interact with RNA that's undergone oxidation. It doesn't matter where RNA or the proteins come from for that. Whether they were created by an intelligence or formed through evolution or just happened to come together by accident in the test tube, they'd still function the same way.

&gt; Being a creationist among evolutionists actually gives me a massive advantage. Evolutionists can't ask *why* something was designed the way it is, only *how* it came about. However I know the Creator, so I can ask why He'd design things in certain ways and make predictions and inferences based off of this. 

&gt; For instance, you know how DNA is double stranded? 

&gt; One strand is called the “sense” strand, and the other the “antisense” strand. For a long time it was thought that only the sense strand was coding, while the antisense strand didn’t code for anything and was essentially just there to help with replication.

&gt; But if Creation is true, that isn’t what we’d expect to see. The intelligence that created us gave us the most efficient design possible. Having half the genetic code go to waste wouldn’t make any sense when it could double the amount of information DNA could encode for by utilizing that strand.

&gt; And that’s exactly what we’re starting to see. According to [here]( http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mreimers/SysBio/Gingeras%20-%20Transcriptome%20complexity.pdf), “…the amount of transcription [that is, RNA production] that occurs cannot be entirely accounted for by current sets of genome-wide annotations. Evidence indicates that most of both strands of the human genome might be transcribed…”

&gt; But there’s no way for that to evolve. If you modify one strand, you modify the other. A single mutation to the antisense strand would only serve to delete the information in the sense strand long before it would create any information in the antisense strand. 
So even if you got information on the antisense strand, you’d be back having useless gibberish on the sense strand. 

&gt; To get information on both strands, you need the sequences on both strands to be very carefully arranged together. That’s complicated, delicate work mutations are completely incapable of - you need a very wise intelligence planning it out beforehand.

&gt; So, if Creation is true, we’d expect information on both strands. If evolution is true, we’d expect (and its been wrongfully thought to be the case that) only one strand contains useful information.

&gt; Creation can lead us to places we never would have found – or would have found much less quickly – if we thought evolution were true. Hopefully I can be living proof of this with my career – that’s a major reason I chose biology.

DebateEvolution,4j9rkn,No-Karma,,t2_x794e,self.DebateEvolution,,"Methodological Naturalism is a belief, and it is no more based on evidence, logic and critical thinking than Theism (e.g., Christianity) is.","In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4j0aax/im_trying_to_convince_my_creationist_cousin_of/) thread, /u/FLSun said to an evolutionist regarding his creationist cousin:

&gt; The problem is that you and your cousin use different ""Methods"" or ""Tools"" to decide what is true or false.
&gt; You use **Evidence, Logic and Critical Thinking Skills** to decide if something is true or false. You know the Earth is a sphere because of the evidence we have.

&gt; Your cousin uses ""Belief"" to decide if something is true or false. Your cousin says Creationism is true because he ""Believes"" in it. And to him Evolution is false because he chose ""Not to Believe"" in it. That's a really terrible method to use.

You, my friend /u/FLSun, ""believe"" in Methodological Naturalism without scientific basis, and with conviction and fervor that I'm sure would put many creationists to shame.

Methodological Naturalism (MN), the assumption that all natural phenomena have natural causes, is scientifically untestable. I say this because MN is a fundamental *assumption* of ""modern"" science. One methodology—science—cannot impartially examine another methodology—MN—upon which it is based; science assumes MN, so contradicting evidence cannot be entertained.

In addition, Methodological Naturalism **IS**, for all intents and purposes, Philosophical Naturalism. Else, what sense would it make for scientists to assume it?

The basic argument for MN's implementation is quite simple: without MN, *any* unexplained phenomenon can attributed to supernatural intervention (""god of the gaps""). Lightning, earthquakes, eclipses, gravity, first life, etc. can be explained as ""God's hand"" at work. This is a science-stopper, since God can capriciously do whatever He wants.

Much progress has been made in science by assuming that there is no supernatural causal agency. The problem is, scientists have lost sight of the fact that MN is an assumption, and now think that science has ""proven"" that there is no supernatural, mistakenly believing that science has found no evidence for supernatural activity. The fact is, the evidence is all around us, but is dismissed. Since MN demands that every phenomenon MUST have a natural cause, the most flimsy excuse for evidence of natural cause is heralded as a rigorously comprehensive explanation. Examples are everywhwere (such as the **fable** of abiogenesis vs. the **Law** of Biogenesis), but I would like to keep the focus of this thread on MN, rather than digressing into analyses of specific cases.

Let me quickly outline the classical argument for MN and show why it is faulty. The argument goes as follows: 

1.) Natural events obey natural laws, which are descriptions of relationships that regularly occur;

2.) Miracles are one-time exceptions to natural laws;

3.) Because natural laws regularly occur, they have much supporting evidence;

4.) Because miracles occur only once, they have little supporting evidence;

4.) Therefore, science should go with the preponderance of evidence, and consider only natural events.

The basic problem with this argument is that science examines two kinds of phenomena:

* **Regular Phenomena**, events that occur repeatedly and consistently. In the examination of regular phenomena, the intent is to propose hypotheses that will be modified as necessary and hopefully developed into laws, as confirming evidence accumulates. This is the realm of the *scientific method*, where repeatability, testability and (theoretical) falsifiability reign.
* **Historical Phenomena**, events that occur only once. These events cannot be repeated (although they sometimes can be re-enacted), but must be examined in more of an evidentiary manner, similar to the way evidence is gathered and analyzed in forensics for a court case. 

Scientists sometimes look with disdain upon the historical ""sciences"", such as the historians of WWII, as not true science. But in fact, historical science pervades the scientific arena. Archaeology, paleontology, and much of geology are historical. In fact, many of the most actively researched areas of science are historical, examining one-time events:

* The ""Big Bang"",
* The origin of life, and even
* evolution itself

are all one-time historical events that are out of the reach of the true scientific method.

I claim that it is silly to assume MN unless MN is in fact true, and MN cannot be tested scientifically as long as MN is an axiomatic foundation for science.

So then, what are we to do, if we want to avoid ""god of the gaps"" *ad hoc* explanations of natural events, and yet allow for the possibility that naturalism is an incorrect philosophical position?

First, we have to realize and acknowledge that the founders of modern science—Newton, Kepler and others—were supernaturalists who, in spite of (in fact, because of) their ""beliefs"", were able to found and fuel the modern scientific era. How were they able to differentiate between events with natural causes and events with supernatural causes?

I claim that there are times (I can think of two) when it can be demonstrated that certain natural phenomena defy naturalistic explanation, and it is a red herring to be concerned that allowing for the possibility of supernatural agency will cripple science.

#### 1. Microbes are more abundant than humans

* There are one-thousand billion *billion* BILLION (10^(30)!) bacteria alone in the biosphere, plus viruses and other microbes.
* That means there are many thousands of times more *bacteria* alive today than there are *cells* in every human that ever lived!

#### 2. Microbes are more fecund than humans

* For sexual creatures, 2 parents produce 1 child.
* For asexual creatures, 1 parent produces 2 children.
* For virues, oftentimes one parent produces many hundreds of offspring.

#### 3. Microbes reproduce faster than humans

* For humans, a generation is 25 years.
* For microbes a generation may be as short as 20 minutes!

#### 4. There are many more “species” of microbes, each of which is a potential enemy

* For asexual microbes, the concept of ""species"" is essentially meaninglss.
* Each mutated microbe can constitute a new threat to humans and other higher animals.

#### 5. Microbes are simpler

* Our defenses, such as the immune system, are extremely complex, and fall out of tune with time.
* Microbes are far simpler, and thus mutate more quickly and easily into a better-adapted form.

#### 6. Microbes are everywhere, travel everywhere, and survive/thrive in every extreme environment

* There are over 100 million bacteria of over 600 species in every milliliter of saliva in your mouth! They inhabit your body openings, bodily fluids, and cuts in your skin.
* “Extremophiles” inhabit the “dead” sea, boiling-hot geysers and deep-sea hydrothermal vents, as well as deadly acidic, basic, salty, oxygen-less, waterless, high-sugar, high-metal, high-pressure, and high-radiation environments.
* Microbes inhabit the stratosphere, 11-31 miles up, where they tolerate simultaneous low pressure, high radiation, and absence of water and nutrients.
* Microbes travel by the wind, bird, [land] animal, fish, and even jet!
* Microbes doubtless preceded humans to the moon (1959: USSR’s Luna 2), mars (1982: NASA’s Viking 1), and even beyond the solar system (Voyager 1, currently ~132 astronomical units out)

#### 7. We are utterly dependent on microbes!

* We cannot avoid contact with microbes, since we depend on them for our very existence.
* Humans have more “gut flora” in their digestive tract than cells in their body! Microbes help break down our food, and we can’t live without them.
* Microbes perform the essential task of breaking down organic waste and preparing it for re-use.

##### Conclusion: All survival advantage is to the microbe. Man could not possibly have won in this struggle, but should have been driven to extinction eons ago if truly this battle raged for millions of years.

DebateEvolution,4hrsvt,angeloitacare,,t2_olzgm,self.DebateEvolution,,The oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II is irreducible complex,"The key process that produces oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) , which splits water molecules and subsequently releases molecular oxygen. This process, which occurs in photosystem II (PSII), is driven by the conversion of visible light to chemical energy. Electrons oxidize water, which leads to the evolution of molecular oxygen and the release of protons into the thylakoid lumen. This proton gradient is a major contributor to the proton motive force used to biosynthesize ATP from ADP via ATP synthase. 

The OEC is composed of a cluster of manganese, calcium and chloride ions bound to extrinsic proteins. In plants there are four (PsbO, PsbP, PsbQ and PsbR). Maintenance of the highly dynamic Mn4CaO5 cluster also requires the delivery of a constant supply of the proper levels of Mn2+ and Ca2+. The mechanism of water oxidation has remained virtually unchanged between green plants and cyanobacteria, and is similar in all higher plants. Simpler mechanisms are unknown. 

Each of the extrinsic proteins of plants are ESSENTIAL, and each was tested upon mutated form, and the mechanism was found inefficient, and compromising the OEC function. Furthermore, a water network around the Mn4CaO5 cluster, and D1 protein subunit of PSII are also absolutely necessary. Each protein and the Mn4CaO5 cluster has no function by its own, only, if duly embedded and working in the whole mechanism. It could therefore not provide any survival advantage to the organism, unless everything is set up. Its the same as to ask what good a piston motor would be by its own ? It has no function , unless duly mounted and well matched inside the motor block. 

There is no ignorance, but based on the scientific evidence of mutation experiments WE DO KNOW OEC absolutely requires each protein and a precisely arranged Mn4CaO5 cluster fully evolved and set up. 

1. High information content (or specified complexity) and irreducible complexity constitute strong indicators or hallmarks of (past) intelligent design.
2. Biological systems have a high information content (or specified complexity) and utilize subsystems that manifest irreducible complexity.
3. Naturalistic mechanisms or undirected causes do not suffice to explain the origin of information (specified complexity) or irreducible complexity.
4. Therefore, intelligent design constitutes the best explanations for the origin of information and irreducible complexity in biological systems.

This thread of genetic similarity connects us and the roughly 10 million other species in the modern world to the entire history of life, back to a single common ancestor more than 3.5 billion years ago. And the evolutionary view of a single (and very ancient) origin of life is supported at the deepest level imaginable: the very nature of the DNA code in which the instructions of genes and chromosomes are written. In all living organisms, the instructions for reproducing and operating the individual is encoded in a chemical language with four letters -- A, C, T, and G, the initials of four chemicals. Combinations of three of these letters specify each of the amino acids that the cell uses in building proteins. 

**Biologically and chemically, there is no reason why this particular genetic code, rather than any of millions or billions of others, should exist, scientists assert**. Yet every species on Earth carries a genetic code that is, for all intents and purposes, identical and universal. The only scientific explanation for this situation is that the genetic code was the result of a single historic accident. That is, this code was the one carried by the single ancestor of life and all of its descendents, including us.”

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/04/4/l_044_02.html

The argument seems to be that there is no functional reason for God to create life with this feature, or for natural selection to select this code over others: rather, what we are seeing here is the signature of historical contingency: the genetic code has been preserved as a “frozen accident”.

However, I don’t think PBS gets the facts right on this one.

Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London, [writes ](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sQBesPE3ELYC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=nick+lane+genetic+code+freeland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9RAztuxlI_&amp;sig=LzO119a6rqUiaIfl21jqoJ2Nt_0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqgOXcko7MAhUO9WMKHY2IDZkQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nick%20lane%20genetic%20code%20freeland&amp;f=false) ""[[Hurst and Freeland](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732450)] considered the damage that could be done by point mutations, in which one letter of a codon is switched for another. Which code, they wondered, could resist such point mutations best, either by retaining exactly the same amino acid, or by substituting a similar one? They found that the real genetic code is startlingly resistant to change: point mutations often preserve the amino acid sequence, and if a change does occur, a physically related amino acid tends to be substituted. In fact, Hurst and Freeland declared the genetic code to be better than a million alternative randomly generated codes. Far from being the folly of nature's blind cryptographer, the code is one in a million. Not only does it resist change, they say, but also by restricting the catastrophic consequences of the changes that do occur, the code actually speeds up evolution: obviously, mutations are more likely to be beneficial if they are not catastrophic. 
Short of positing celestial design, the only way to explain optimization is via the workings of selection.""

So, I contend that PBS got it wrong when they argued that the genetic code is evidence for common descent because  “there is no reason why this particular genetic code, rather than any of millions or billions of others, should exist”.",34,1461996882,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4h3frr/my_contention_pbs_gives_a_faulty_argument_for/

Computer Simulation of Post Flood Re-population Using Discrete Objects to Represent Each Person

Being as it is Sunday lets investigate this a bit. Now the cornerstone of the Creationist argument is the supposed flood at the time of Noah that killed of everything and created the fossils via under water land slides. Of course the other major thing that happened as a result of the flood was the repopulation of the Earth. Well lets take a look at that shall we.

So lets see after 'The Flood' (insert evil music here) you have Noah and his clan as the only survivors and they have to repopulate the Earth.  So you have four pairs of breeders. We will include Noah and his wife even though the Bible only says they only had three kids I figured I would give the repopulation effort its best chance.  So in the same vain I will increase the life spans out to 200 years as Creationists say people lived longer way back then and just to be nice I suspend the effects of the 'Fall from Grace' so there is no disease, cancer or the possibility of famine or other natural calamities.  By the way the simulation used actual ages and life spans given for the Noah clan as in the Bible.

Now on to female reproduction which will start at maturity, age 13, and continue along until menopause sets in at 110. Remember people will be living to 200 years. Next we will use standard gestation for people, 39 weeks with a minimal 6 week recovery period between pregnancies.  Women will have a 30% chance of getting pregnant every time they have sex regardless of age.  Of course there will be no deaths by child birth and 0 infant and child mortality. And of course lets not forget twins 2% of the time.

In regards to normal deaths we will just extrapolate to the 200 year life spans from the best case we have which is today in a first world country.

Next lets choose a point at which to check on the re population progress of Noah and the gang. How about the building of the Great Pyramids. Yes I know real science has them built before 'The Flood' (insert evil music here) but for the sake of argument lets use one of the accepted Young Earth Creationist dates, two hundred years post flood.

Now we run the simulation several times and take the averages and the results after 200 years are:

Boys (under 12) : 850130
Girls (under 12) : 997946
Men (13-130) : 214198
Women (13-130) : 251641
Elderly (132+) : 5

Total Population : 2313920  

Notice that children under 12 make up about 80% of the population and another interesting thing is that when you analyze the numbers is that  practically every woman over the age of 15 is nursing two children while being pregnant. Not to mention that they are also looking after an average of eight other children at the same time. 

But at least we have in excess of the 20,000 men known to have been used to build the Great Pyramids even if most of then are under the age of 16 years old.

Oh no, oh dear, Oh wait!! 

That is not right at all. I completely forgot about the Tower of Babel debacle (insert more scarey music here).  As a result of this the post flood population was divided into, at least by creationist research, 76 different social and linguistic groups. So lets see then 214198 men divided among 76 societies is 2818 men for each society most of which are children under 16 years of age.

Well there you have it. At the time the Great Pyramids, while giving every advantage to the Noah clan, there were only about 2818 males in total in all of Egypt to build them. So where did the rest of the 20,000 men come from to build the pyramids not to mention the men that are required to run the Egyptian civilization to support them.",17,1461508827,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4g8drw/creationists_take_it_on_the_chin_again_there_was/
DebateEvolution,4fpctk,BioRicky,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Argument for ID?,"**From someone else (likely an ID proponent):**


&gt; I once debated a phd biologist on reddit and pointed out his use of a genetic fallacy.  He responded ""I've never heard of the genetic fallacy but it sounds like yet another creationist argument.""  He was dead serious--I kid you not.

&gt; My point is we're dealing here with the philosophical question as to when it's valid to infer design.  Biology certainly informs with useful data, but it's ultimately decided through philosophy.  Suppose we received a radio signal from alpha centauri that alternated between the digits of pi and the fibonnachi sequences exactly every 3600 seconds.  We then ruled out every known possible natural cause as an explanation.  Does it make sense to then conclude an unknown natural cause creates the signal (naturalism-of-the-gaps), or should we conclude that intelligent aliens are the best explanation?

&gt; From reading your other comments you seem to be under the mistaken idea that abiogenesis is likely and that evolutionary processes can account (or are likely to account) for the increasing complexity and diversification of life from there.  In brief response:

&gt; 1.  On abiogensis:  There is an enormous complexity gap between the simplest 1000+ gene free-living organisms, and everything simpler (obligate inter-cellular parasites, viruses, prions).  If there were a gradual path from chemical reactions to cells we should expect this range to be filled with simpler, free-living replicators.  It's not and all our attempts to reductively engineer simpler cells hits a complexity wall beyond which they require increasing levels of life support to survive.  You can posit as-yet-unknown scenarios, but that's no different than assuming a natural cause for our hourly pi-fibonnacci broadcast.

&gt; 2.  Evolution is too slow.  It takes a trillion malaria to evolve resistance to the drugs pyrimethamine and adovaquone, through paths of 1-4 point mutations.  It takes 10^20 of them to evolve resistance to the durg chloroquine thorugh a path of 4 to 10 point mutations.  This huge mutational search for trivial gains is seen across all microbes.  If that weren't the case we'd hear about it instead of how it takes nearly a trillion e coli just to duplicate their existing citrate gene a few times next to a new promoter.  Given this, how can something as mundate as mammal evolution be explained, where selection is far weaker than microbes?  There would've been less than a trillion of us since a chimp divergence, and less than 10^20 mammals ever existing in 200m years since the original radiation.  This benchmark is not to conflated with the evolutionary processes of allele shuffling and loss.  Those can bring about phenotypic change very rapidly but cannot account for the large differences in genetic information separating clades.

&gt; 3.  Adding to #2, all population genetics simulations that use realistic parameters show fitness declining in mammals even under strong purifying selection.  Deleterious mutations arrive faster than selection can remove them, leading to specific sequences being replaced with random noise until the population goes extinct.  What selection can't maintain it certainly can't create.

&gt; I await your response : )

DebateEvolution,4fdz4t,No-Karma,,t2_x794e,self.DebateEvolution,,Intelligent Design: Quick Tutorial and AMA,"# What is ""Intelligent Design"" (ID) Theory?

ID is a generalization of multitudes of observations in nature. As such, I prefer to refer to it as a Law (since that is what a Law is), rather than a Theory. Here is the generalization of the observations:

### In all cases, whenever a phenomenon satisfies three criteria:
### * Contingency;
### * Specification;
### * Complexity,
### and the phenomenon's cause is known, we **observe** that the cause is an intelligence. No contradictions to this cause-effect relationship have ever been documented.

## The three Criteria

Let's examine the three criteria.

### Contingency

Contingency is a term unfamiliar to many, so I will take a moment to explain it.

The opposite of ""contingency"" is ""necessity"", and it helps me, as well as as many others, to grasp the concept. If a relationship phenomenon exhibits necessity, it means that the cause-effect relationship is ""necessitated"" by the physics of the cause and its effect. For example, if I take a double-headed coin and flip it 100 times, I will observe (to no one's surprise) that the coin comes up heads all 100 times. This is because the phenomenon exhibits 100% necessity and 0% contingency (we could account for the outside chance that the coin will land on edge and say it exhibits 99.99999% necessity and 0.00001% contingency, but you get the idea).

There are many phenomena in nature that exhibit contingency: the distribution of gas molecules in a container, the ""ticks"" of a Geiger counter (the overall *rate* of the ticks is necessitated, but their distibution is contingent), the weathering of a rock.

We humans have invented objects whose sole purpose is to function as a medium exhibiting contingency: papyrus and ink, clay cylinders, blackboards/whiteboards, books, and flash drives, to name a few.

You can see that we might say that ""contingent"" is the same as ""random"", and that would be true, were it not for the next criterion.

### Specification

Specification speaks of an intended or observed relationship between the cause and an effect, one which is **unrelated** as far as physics is concerned. An example would be the distribution of ink on a paper that maps the outline of Florida. You could study the physics of paper and ink forever, and never discover a physical influence that causes the ink to organize such that it displays a representation of Florida's coastline.

Note that, just as contingency may not be 100%, so specification may also be less than perfect. The aforementioned Florida map may be weathered and torn, it may be out of date, it may include erroneous, random or unrelated information (such as a note scribbled on it to remember a telephone number), or it may have been drawn by a child or a dyslexic. Therefore, we refer to the *correlation* that exists between the object (the map of Florida) and its referent (the actual coastline of Florida). This correlation can be expressed in the measure of information called the ""bit"" (**bi**nary dig**it**).

### Complexity

Complexity establishes a threshold on the specification's correlation that must be achieved in order to invoke this ID law. There is a direct relationship between the amount of correlation and its likelihood (probability) of occurring by chance alone. For example, a single bit of correlation means that there was a 50/50 chance that the correlation was real and not simply chance. A single bit of correlation is hardly ever of any value. Ten bits implies that there is only 0.1% chance that the correlation was mere chance, which may be a significant amount of correlation. Each extra bit of correlation halves the likelihood that it is by chance, so the likelihood drops precipitously as bits are added.

So there you have it. If a phenomenon exhibits contingency (freedom from necessity), and then exhibits specificity by possessing a correlation to an *independent* set of data, and that correlation is strong enough to rule out chance, the phenomenon can be confidently attributed to an intelligence. And this turns out to be true every time it can be independently verified (that is, the real cause is known).

Some topics I have not discussed, and which may be discussed in further remarks:

### Intelligent Design's Application to Other Disciplines

Archaeology, CSI, cryptography, SETI

### False Negative and False Positive Results

False negatives can occur, but not false positives.

### The ""Universal Probability Bound"" Concept

If a phenomenon exhibits 500 or more bits of correlation, an intelligent cause is certain.

DebateEvolution,4f5zjq,cosmic_spiral,,t2_x8nmc,self.DebateEvolution,,Creation vs Evolution vs ID vs Intervention," Evolutionists, or ""Darwinists,"" believe life initiated on prehistoric Earth when a lifeless but chemical-filled ""primordial soup"" was struck by lightning. The Miller-Urey experiments attempting to prove this theory unequivocally failed to do so; however, they still often form the backbone of evolutionary arguments.

Another argument for evolution is based on Charles Darwin's observation of micro-evolution, piecemeal physical adaptations within a species that develop over time, such as the lengthening of a Tortoise's neck to reach high-growing vegetation, or changes in the shape of a Finch's beak to specialize in eating various foods.

Darwin postulated that if small changes can occur within a species over hundreds or thousands of years, perhaps over tens of thousands of years a species may adapt, or ""evolve,"" into an entirely different species. To his credit as a great thinker and honest seeker of truth, Darwin admitted his ideas were only a theory that needed much more evidence to confirm it.

He especially stressed the need for evidence of ""transitional"" species, those adapting from one to another at the macro level of evolution. If these ""missing links,"" as they have come to be called, could not be found, then his theory would have to be judged wrong. To this day, no scientist has found confirmable evidence of a species in undeniable transition from one to another.

Creationism is the belief that all life was created by God. Creationism has varying degrees, from the ""Young Earth"" faction that believes in a literal ""6 days of creation"" as described in the Bible, to the more relaxed ""Old Earth"" faction that also believes God did it all, but in His ""divine"" version of 6 days, each of which could be millions of years for all humans can know about His perceptions.

Intelligent Design is a science-based rebuttal to Darwinism that uses modern microbiological evidence to claim that macro-evolution is simply not possible, and does not account for life on Earth. They postulate that life is so incredibly complex at its most basic level, there is no plausible explanation for it to exist other than that at some point an ""intelligent"" entity (they do not specify this entity, but it would be vastly more intelligent than humans) had to consciously and deliberately create life.

Intervention Theory agrees to a large extent with Intelligent Design, using many of the same scientific arguments against Darwinism to disprove evolution. Unlike the IDers, Interventionists put a variety of names to the entities that created life on Earth. Some call them ""aliens,"" other call them ""Extraterrestrial Biological Entities, or EBEs"", and some call them ""Terraformers."" Whatever their name, Interventionists attribute their actions to scientific capacity rather than ""miracles.""

The core belief of Intervention Theory is that these beings brought life to Earth and manipulated it for their own purposes. They seem to have incrementally terraformed and populated the planet into what it is now. About 300,000 years ago, some called ""Anunnaki"" came to live on Earth, and in that process they genetically engineered humans. These alien beings are responsible for the megalithic structures around the world, the impossibly rapid growth and advancement of Sumer, the first recognized ""civilized"" culture, the domestication of plants and animals, and the unexplainable flaws in human DNA. (We have, for example, over 4000 genetic disorders--vastly more than other ""higher"" primates.)

""Science in its ideology sees itself as doing a fearless exploration of the unknown. Most of the time it is a fearful exploration of the almost known.""

- Rupert Sheldrake

Intervention Theory is seldom acknowledged or discussed by its competitors, and when it is discussed, it is ridiculed or dismissed outright. This is because today it stands on a threshold occupied by many other ideas now recognized as ""ahead of their time."" For example, in 1915 a German meteorologist named Alfred Wegener provided overwhelming evidence that Earth's entire surface was composed of giant moveable plates. Wegener had everything to prove his case, anyone could see that he was right, but he couldn't explain how the plates might move, only that they must move in some way. Because he lacked a mechanism for his observations, his peers who were not ready to accept a ""moveable"" or ""unstable"" Earth, were able to dismiss the obvious truth of his arguments. Not until 40 years later did the discovery of ""plate tectonics"" show that Wegener had been right all along. He was long dead by the time a full generation of ""fearful explorers"" had died along with him.

You may think, ""But that was nearly a century ago, we're much better now."" Sadly, time has nothing to do with it. Scientific elites are every bit as arrogant, egotistical, greedy, and petty as ever. In fact, in 1982 those same lamentable character traits led colleagues of chemist Daniel Shechtman to ridicule, dismiss, and even ask for his resignation for ""bringing disgrace"" to his team when he discovered a new type of five-sided crystal that did not conform to the structure that ""everyone knew"" all crystals had to possess. Dr. Shechtman's discovery has since been dubbed quasicrystals, and eventually, after years of stout resistance from his colleagues doing their usual ""fearful exploration of the almost known,"" quasicrystals were fully accepted by the scientific establishment and Daniel Shechtman was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

For Interventionists, what is particularly intriguing about this case is that the same unusual, non-repeating pattern of the quasicrystal is, it turns out, also found in very ancient mosaics, and those which mimic even older patterns.

Interventionists find evidence of ancient knowledge being revealed or discovered in various places around the world, and in each case it is attributed to alien overlords giving the information to local people who could not have discovered it on their own. Some attempt to dismiss this as circumstantial evidence, but so much of is now piled up that even the most ""fearful explorers"" are running out of excuses.

In 1968, Erich Von Daniken famously wrote about evidence of ancient technologies in the world's megalithic structures, which clearly could not have been constructed by ancient people in the ways mainstreamers suggest. As with Alfred Wegener, no one could seriously refute the validity of Von Daniken's arguments. However, also like Wegener, he could not establish a provable mechanism for how aliens from beyond Earth could have traveled here to create those wonders.

This problem was solved in 1976 by Zecharia Sitchin, who provided the required mechanism with his brilliant interpretations of the writings of the ancient Sumerians, in which they spoke freely of ""gods"" from another planet living among them as their lords and masters. Unfortunately, mainstream science can and does dismiss these 4,000 year old writings on stone tablets as ""mythology"" that could not possibly be the actual history the Sumerians portrayed them to be.

Now DNA analysis offers the final, crippling blow to the ""fearful explorers,"" providing irrefutable evidence of this unearthly tampering. Lloyd Pye takes what has previously been put forth by Von Daniken, Sitchin and others, to fill in the last remaining gaps in the story. DNA provides conclusive proof of what the Sumerians wrote 4000 years ago when they said their down-to-earth ""gods"" created humans and domesticated plants and animals in ""a house of fashioning"" to ""give the gods their ease.""

In other words, they genetically engineered the things they needed to make life for themselves as easy as possible on what had to be a distant and no doubt difficult outpost far from their home planet. This is now the core of Intervention Theory, and this is what will ultimately prevail against the three current leaders in the race to identify the truth about origins on our planet.",8,1460885682,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4f5zjq/creation_vs_evolution_vs_id_vs_intervention/
DebateEvolution,4f4br2,BioRicky,,,self.DebateEvolution,,Creationists and Abiogenesis,"So there is a certain trend for some people to regularly visit this sub with either copy/pasta about why Abiogenesis is impossible or variations of the exact same arguments about why Abiogenesis is impossible.

*Examples of creationists opening a new thread for this:*

*[One (just yesterday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4eymc8/stephen_hawkings_evolutionary_bias/),
[Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/450m0a/open_questions_in_biology_biochemistry_and/),
[Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/43fn4g/catch22_chicken_and_egg_problems_in_biology_and/)*

*et cetera*

So I figured I'll write a dumbed down version of how a thread determined to ""disprove"" Abiogenesis should never look like:

&amp;nbsp;

1. No, big numbers are not scary. As we can see [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010.html), the argument that probabilities are low is not only irrelevant, but the claim mostly assumes things that are wrong. (i.e. they don't take into account that a proto cell could have been much [simpler](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_1.html))

2. No, Abiogenesis did not occur by chance, and the mechanisms involved in the process are not governed by chance as you can read [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_2.html). Biochemistry is a heavily understood scientific discipline.

3. No, the fact that we are not able to tell how the ""first"" life form or cell exactly looked like is not a point for you. The fact that we yet can't tell the whole process required to form life is also not a point for you.
(This is what we call an [argument from incredulity](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA100.html) which basically boils down to:
""Ha ha, you are not able to tell me, from A to Z, how chemical evolution works and occurred, therefore it is impossible or never happened."")

4. No, it's not a good idea to claim that stuff is too complex to have been formed, whether it's proteins, protocells, RNA or DNA. There are [several](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB010_1.html). [reasons](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB025.html). [why](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB015.html).

5. No, the ToE is not at all dependent on Abiogenesis being proven as you can read [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB090.html). The ToE applies as long as life exists and that is the definition of it.

&amp;nbsp;

With this, I hope to see a rise in the quality of posts whenever somebody feels like he wants to talk about Abiogenesis. And if that's not enough here is an index to stuff we found out related to abiogenesis:

DebateEvolution,4eymc8,No-Karma,,t2_x794e,self.DebateEvolution,,Stephen Hawking's Evolutionary Bias,"Stephen Hawking is a brilliant, brilliant cosmologist and theoretical physicist; he is considered by many to be the most intelligent man alive. He has overcome incredible challenges to achieve prominence at the highest echelons of academia. One wonders what he might be capable of achieving if he did not have to communicate via an electronic voice box from a body almost totally paralyzed.

Stephen Hawking is also an atheist, and a thoughtful one at that. But as an atheist, and therefore a naturalist, he must find naturalistic explanations for all natural phenomena. That includes first life. He is therefore a thoroughgoing subscriber to the only option: abiogenesis.

But abiogenesis runs into a problem. The simplest life that we have succeeded in discovering or creating, indeed that we are capable of conceiving, is far, far too complex, and therefore improbable, to have occurred spontaneously -- even once in all past time. Therefore, since his atheism is non-negotiable, he finds it necessary to make abiogenesis appear less improbable than research and common sense indicate. Whether he does this consciously or unconsciously, we cannot tell. Here is my evidence, though, that he does it.

In his landmark book ""A Brief History of Time"", Hawking is discussing the Second Law of Thermodynamics (SLoT). He asks the reader to consider a system of gas molecules in a **box**. He correctly analyzes the probabilities of various micro-states and demonstrates that the SLoT is essentially a statement of macro-scale probability, and that the SLoT merely asserts that the thermodynamic process will never proceed from a more probable state to a less probable state.

But in the process of explanation, he makes a misleading statement that is frequently made among evolutionists. In the [highlighted text](http://imgur.com/8RKiS2W), he says, ""The probability of all the gas molecules in our first box being found in one half of the box at a later time is **many millions of millions to one**, but it **can happen**.""

Bear in mind that Hawking wrote this book for the layperson (albeit the intelligent layperson). Three questions:

* What is a layperson going to visualize as the size of the ""box""? I would think that most people would visualize a shoe box. Some might see anything from a file box at the largest, to a jewelry box at the smallest. No one is going to visualize a box as big as a refrigerator or so small a microscope is needed to view it.

* What does the layperson assume is the air pressure inside the box? Without doubt he would expect the gas to be under normal room conditions, also called STP (standard temperature and pressure).

* What is assumed about the size of ""many"" in his phrase ""many millions of millions to one""? I think most laypeople would say that it means dozens, hundreds or thousands. Certainly, it could mean no more than a million -- otherwise it is even bigger that even the two superlatives that follow it. For example, it would be true, but misleading, for me to state, ""There are many hundreds of poor people in the world"". You would immediately object, claiming that I am minimizing the plight of the poor.

Now, let's put this all together. To give Hawking as much benefit of the doubt as possible, let's assume the smallest ""box"", say one milliliter (a typical bottle of eye drops contains 15 ml). Sorry, I can't give any leeway regarding the pressure; all would expect STP. And let's assume, nonsensical as it is, that ""many"" means ""millions"".

We can easily calculate the number of gas particles in the box at STP using unit cancellation (Hawking can do this in his head):

(1 ml) * (1 liter / 1000 ml) * (1 mole / 22.4 liters) * (6.02e23 particles / mole) = 2.6875e19 particles

So, the tiny box contains 26 quintillion, 875 quadrillion particles!

So then, what is the probability that all 26 quintillion particles would happen to be found in the same half of the box? It can be expressed as

P = 1 / 2^(26875000000000000000)

Don't even try to imagine how small this number is!

So, what is my complaint? I'm saying that you don't grossly overestimate a probability, and then say that it can happen! But Hawking does this, I suspect without even thinking of how erroneously he has misstated it, because he is continually convincing himself that abiogenesis *can happen*, and molecule-to-man evolution *can happen*.

No, they can't.

P.S.:

Q: How many particles would there be in the box if the probability P were ""one in a million million million""?

A: A whole 60!

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum):

""Ultra-high vacuum chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10^−12) of atmospheric pressure (100 nPa), and can reach around **100 particles/cm^(3)**.""

That's **100 particles/ml** in our best man-made vacuum chambers!",50,1460751656,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4eymc8/stephen_hawkings_evolutionary_bias/

The solution for their cytokinesis is to seperate the two cells from inside with the phragmoplast wich builds the cell plate etc.

How does this phragmoplast evolve? The phragmoplast only has to exist because of the cell wall. So the cell wall must've come first i assume. With the cell wall the cell can't seperate though because of aforementioned reasons. So cells with cell walls shouldn't be able to do cell division. So they should die out.

Solutions?

- The phragmoplast evolved first. *Why though? There is no reason to and i can imagine the process is more costly, else all organisms would divide by this process.*

- The phragmoplast and cell walls evolved at the same time. *Too random?*

- Cell walls came first but early plants dismantled the cell wall first, then seperated like animals, then build cell walls again. Someday the phragmoplast evolved wich was more efficent and these plants ""won"" over other plants.

DebateEvolution,4elmvc,ShatosiMakanoto,,t2_by1o2,self.DebateEvolution,,"Comments by a Creationist on the Definitions of ""Evolution"" , ""Micro Evolution"" and ""Macro Evolution""","In the [Definitions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1nasgb/definitions/), ""Evolution"" is defined as:

&gt; The change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.

Much obfuscation and confusion is introduced via the definition of this term. As a creationist, I can say that all (informed) creationists agree that this kind of evolution does indeed occur, and constitutes no stumbling block for any interpretation of Genesis. Debate ended. Evolution is simply small changes over time, as opposed to, say, revolution. The real issue arises when this term is used as a substitute for ""Common Descent"", which is a *non sequitur* from simple evolution as defined above. I, as a computer design engineer who has applied Information and Probability Theories in my daily work, see Intelligent Design (ID) Theory as a logical inference, and one which militates against Common Descent.

&gt; Micro Evolution: changes that occur below the taxonomic level of ""Species"".

&gt; Macro Evolution: changes that occur AT or ABOVE the taxonomic level of ""Species"".

First, realize that the Bible doesn't address the term ""species"", but rather uses the term ""kind"" (**מִין** ""min"" in Hebrew). The term ""species"" is a bit nebulous (yes, I know that ""kind"" is even more nebulous!), but most taxonomists define a species boundary as the point at which fertile cross-breeding can no longer occur (thus, all domestic dogs, plus many wild dogs, are the same species). I prefer a slightly different pair of definitions:

&gt; Micro Evolution: changes that occur as a result of Mendelian recombination.

&gt; Macro Evolution: changes that occur as a result of mutations.

Note that in an effort to defend Common Descent Evolution, evolutionists frequently put up examples of Micro-Evolution (peppered moth, Darwin's finches), which can never drive Common Descent Evolution. And Lenski's [Long-Term Evolution Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) is a stunning demonstration of the inability of mutations to drive upward change (If you're unfamiliar with this experiment: Lenski's *e. coli* took over 30,000 generations to drive a two-step mutation sequence to **break** a genetic switch that prevented metabolization of citrate in aerobic conditions, which of course constitutes **de**volution, not **e**volution).

They age and grow weak and tired, they get sick or injured and die off. They are susceptible to death by falling. The Great shopping kart down Mt.

DebateEvolution,4buqon,Funsucker10,,t2_wmii8,self.DebateEvolution,,"A question I've had for a while now: What if neither creationism nor evolution nor any of their variants (I.e. Intelligent design, created evolution theories, etc.) were the answer?","After growing up in a religious community that strictly adhered to the idea that the Earth was 6000 years old, I learned many of the holes (both illogical and even the few logical ones) to evolution. After finally going to a public school I began to learn about the great deal of evidence supporting the theory of Evolution. For a long time, I believed evolution was the answer to how things are as they are. As time went on though, I began to question it, due to the few logical holes that exist within evolution, that I've seen brought up on this subreddit.

I looked up alternatives to both. All that I've seen seem to be variations or combinations of both theories. Even aliens would still be evidence of one of these two theories. The only alternative I found that actually seemed to be an alternative was morphic resonance, which seems a little out there to say the least, but the person who put fourth this theory said that creationism and evolution are just ideas we have slumped into as humans.

What if, we have spent so much time debating these two ideas, seeking evidence that confirmed these two theories, that we didn't even consider alternatives. At this point we've become so ingrained that you have to either believe this way or that way, and we've only sought out the evidence that supported these two ideas, and all of our inferences from findings are centered around one of these two ideas when science was actually showing something else but we were conditioned to believe in one of these two ideas that we couldn't make completely open minded inferences. 

How long would it take for science to propose an alternative and find evidence for an alternative? Is it not possible that this would have hindered us in our understanding of the universe? Even now most of you reading this would think this sounds crazy, I even think it sounds partly crazy, but I also believe all people are inherently capable of rational thought, but because of the holes in evolution (even the strongest believers in evolution know that there is at least one hole (the lack of any transitional fossil) that science can't fully explain (possibly yet but maybe never) and in the best attempts to explain this hole, leaps are made without evidence directly observable evidence) it keeps people from being able to just jump on board with it and makes it so, from their point of view, their ideas are more plausible (although the evidence with creation is very faulty to say the least, written testimony handed down through thousands of years (assuming this is what really happened which is somewhat plausible) could be considered a type of evidence). 

Isn't it possible that the solution to the debate is to come up with a better theory based on science, that might even address the few flaws that seem (from my perspective: how do we know our inferences from data are correct, other variables effecting outcomes of studies, scientists that have lied on paper, not all results are published, especially if they offer contradicting evidence to previous landmark studies, statistical significance is still found in the natural sciences) to exist within the modern scientific method itself? Would we as a species even know where to begin at this point?

let’s look at some of the expectations of the natural selection-based modern synthesis: (i) the largest differences within given categories of multicellular organisms, the animals or plants, for example, should have appeared gradually, only after exceptionally long periods of evolution; (ii) the extensive genetic changes required to generate such large differences over such vast times would have virtually erased any similarity between the sets of genes coordinating development in the different types of organism; and (iii) evolution of body types and organs should continue indefinitely. Since genetic mutation never ceases, novel organismal forms should constantly be appearing.


All these predictions of the standard model have proved to be incorrect. The actual state of affairs however, are expected outcomes of the “physico-genetic” picture outlined above.

The argument of the mind of all matter in the universe
1. “The ultimate cause of atheism, Newton asserted, is ‘the notion of bodies having, as it were, a complete, absolute and independent reality in themselves.’”
2. The 1925 discovery of quantum mechanics solved the problem of the Universe’s nature. Bright physicists were again led to believe what is for atheists the unbelievable — that the Universe is mental.
3. According to Sir James Jeans an astronomer, mathematician and physicists of Princeton University: “the stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter…we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.”
4. Matter cannot produce mind but rather a thoughtful mind can produce structures of matter. If we leave all the molecules or atoms of the brain on a pile under Mother Nature’s sky no brain or mind will ever be produced by thunderbolts, high pressures or typhoons. But a person with a mind can create e.g. a computer.
5. This means mind pre-existed to matter.
6. A mind is a property of a person and the mind of the universe can only be God’s.
7. God exists.


–  Max Planck, theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918
“I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness.”  
Eugene Wigner, theoretical physicist and mathematician. He received a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963
“It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.”


what about R.C. Henry,  Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University ,  “The Mental Universe” ; Nature 436:29,2005) ?  He wrote:
“A fundamental conclusion of the new physics also acknowledges that the observer creates the reality. As observers, we are personally involved with the creation of our own reality. Physicists are being forced to admit that the universe is a “mental” construction. Pioneering physicist Sir James Jeans wrote: “The stream of knowledge is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter, we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter. Get over it, and accept the inarguable conclusion. The universe is immaterial-mental and spiritual.” 



Newton called light “particles”, knowing the concept to be an ‘effective theory’ — useful, not true. As noted by Newton’s biographer Richard Westfall:
“The ultimate cause of atheism, Newton asserted, is ‘this notion of bodies having, as it were, a complete, absolute and independent reality in themselves.’” Newton knew of Newton’s rings and was untroubled by what is shallowly called ‘wave/particle duality’.

When methodological naturalism is applied, the only explanation for the origin of life is abiogenesis, and of biodiversity, Darwins Theory of evolution. Proponents repeat like a mantra : Evolution is a fact. If that were the case, there would exist far more convincing , clear scientific answers to  almost all relevant scientific questions and issues. This is far from being the case. Based on scientific papers, quite a different picture arises. Instead of compelling answers, questionmarks and lack of understanding, generalized ignorance in regard of almost all relevant issues,  and conceptual problems are the most common. Since the information is widely sparse and scattered amongst thousands of scientific papers, its not so evident that this is the factual state of matter. The general public is duped by effect slogans, that give the false impression of certainty of naturalism. The standard answer, when proponents of naturalism are confronted with this situation, is: ""We are working on it"". Or: ""We don't know yet"". As if naturalism would be the answer in the future, no matter what. Aren't these not a prima facie of  "" evolution of the gaps"" arguments ? The question is: If a certain line of reasoning  is not persuasive or convincing, or only leads to dead ends, then why do proponents of materialism not change their mind because of it? The more scientific papers are published, the less likely the scenario of evolution  and abiogenesis and cosmic evolution becomes. The gaps are NOT being closed. They widen more and more. Some evolutionary predictions have even been falsified. We should consider the fact that modern biology may have reached its limits on several key issues and subjects. All discussions on principal theories and experiments in the field either end in vague suppositions and guesswork, statements of blind faith, made up scenarios,  or in a confession of ignorance.  Fact is  there remains a huge gulf in our understanding… This lack of understanding is not just ignorance about some secondary details; it is a big conceptual gap.  The reach of the end of the road is evident in the matter of almost all major questions. The major questions of evolutionary novelties and abiogenesis  are very far from being clearly formulated, even understood,  and nowhere near being solved, and for most, there is no solution at all at sight. But proponents of evolution firmly believe, one day a solution will be found. It doesn't take a couple of month, and a new scientific paper with wild speculations about abiogenesis is published, and eagerly swallowed by the anscious public, that finally wants its preferred world view being confirmed.  We don't know yet, therefore evolution and abiogenesis ? That way, the design hypothesis remains out of the equation in the beginning, and out at the end, and never receives a serious and honest consideration. If the scientific evidence does not provide satisfactory explanations through naturalism, why should we not change your minds and look somewhere else ?  I see only one reason : there is a emotional commitment to naturalism. Reason is not on the side of the materialist. The believer in creation imho has good reasons to hold his world view. Reason is on his side. The evidence points massive in that direction. There is certainly the oponent just right on the corner, eagerly waiting to claim "" argument of ignorance "".

In Joseph Heller’s classic novel about World War II,Catch-22, an aviator could be excused from combat duty for being crazy. But a rule specified that he first had to request an excuse, and anyone who requested an excuse from combat duty was obviously not crazy, so such requests were invariably denied. The rule that made it impossible to be excused from combat duty was called “Catch-22.”



The nitrogen cicle, irreducible interdependence, and the origin of life 15

Without cyanobacteria - no fixed nitrogen is available. Without fixed nitrogen, no DNA, no amino-acids, no protein can be synthesised. Without DNA, no amino-acids,protein, or cyanobacteria are possible. So there you have a interdependent cycle, with no beginning. But, wait : there is more : cyanobacteria are facultative anaerobes - meaning that they can respire either aerobically or anaerobically. The complexity of two respiratory cycles is very high: the Krebs cycle alone requiring about 12 enzymes, and the anaerobic requiring somewhat fewer, say 8.  So in order for the cyanobacteria to survive, about 40 enzymes are already involved - none of which can be made without fixed nitrogen. So here we have a chicken-egg problem par excellence , which came first..... ??

Oxygen and life have a catch 22 relationship 3

Catch 22 is a situation in which an action has consequences which make impossible to pursue that action. Oxygen is very harmful to life. At the same time oxygen is needed to provide the ozone layer which protects life from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) coming from the sun. If Cyanobacteria came before oxygen, because it is the cause of oxygen, then Cyanobacteria would have had to develop several forms of protection to mitigate the damage from UVR: avoidance, scavenging, screening, repair, and programmed cell death. However, UVR damage is immediate and the time needed to “evolve” protection against it via natural selection, incredibly slow. So, UVR damage would occur before any such defense mechanisms could evolve. Both the transcription and translation systems depend upon numerous proteins, many of which are jointly necessary for protein synthesis to occur at all. Yet all of these proteins are made by this very process. Proteins involved in transcription such as RNA polymerases, for example, are built from instructions carried on an RNA transcript. Translation of the RNA transcript depends upon other specialized enzymes such as synthetases, yet the information to build these enzymes is translated during the translation process that synthetases themselves facilitate.
 Biochemist David Goodsell describes the problem, ""The key molecular process that makes modern life possible is protein synthesis, since proteins are used in nearly every aspect of living. The synthesis of proteins requires a tightly integrated sequence of reactions, most of which are themselves performed by proteins."" Or as Jacques Monod noted in 1971: ""The code is meaningless unless translated. The modern cell's translating machinery consists of at least fifty macromolecular components which are themselves coded in DNA: the code cannot be translated otherwise than by products of translation."" (Scientists now know that translation actually requires more than a hundred proteins.)
The integrated complexity of the cell's information-processing system has prompted some profound reflection. As Lewontin asks, ""What makes the proteins that are necessary to make the protein?"" As David Goodsell puts it, this ""is one of the unanswered riddles of biochemistry: which came first, proteins or protein synthesis? If proteins are needed to make proteins, how did the whole thing get started?"" The end result of protein synthesis is required before it can begin.

The Interdependency of Lipid Membranes and Membrane Proteins 16

The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. The interdependency of lipid membranes and membrane proteins suggests that lipid bilayers and membrane proteins co-evolved together with membrane bioenergetics.
The nonsense of this assertion is evident. How could the membrane proteins co-evolve, if they had to be manufactured in the machinery , protected by the cell membrane ? 
The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer.  The ER and Golgi apparatus together constitute the endomembrane compartment in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The endomembrane compartment is a major site of lipid synthesis, and the ER is where not only lipids are synthesized, but membrane-bound proteins and secretory proteins are also made. 

So in order to make cell membranes, the Endoplasmic Recticulum is required. But also the Golgi Apparatus, the peroxysome, and the mitochondria. But these only function, if protected and encapsulated in the cell membrane. What came first, the cell membrane, or the endoplasmic recticulum ? This is one of many other catch22 situations in the cell, which indicate that the cell could not emerge in a stepwise gradual manner, as proponents of natural mechanisms want to make us believe.

Not only is the cell membrane intricate and complex (and certainly not random), but it has tuning parameters such as the degree to which the phospholipid tails are saturated. It is another example of a sophisticated biological design about which evolutionists can only speculate. Random mutations must have luckily assembled molecular mechanisms which sense environmental challenges and respond to them by altering the phospholipid population in the membrane in just the right way. Such designs are tremendously helpful so of course they would have been preserved by natural selection. It is yet another example of how silly evolutionary theory is in light of scientific facts.

The DNA - Enzyme System is Irreducibly Complex 9 

An often undiscussed aspect of complexity is how the tRNA get assigned to the right amino acids. For the DNA language to be translated properly, each tRNA codon must be attached to the correct amino acid. If this crucial step in DNA replication is not functional, then the language of DNA breaks down. Special enzymes called aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) ensure that the proper amino acid is attached to a tRNA with the correct codon through a chemical reaction called ""aminoacylation."" Accurate translation requires not only that each tRNA be assigned the correct amino acid, but also that it not be aminoacylated by any of the aaRS molecules for the other 19 amino acids. One biochemistry textbook notes that because all aaRSs catalyze similar reactions upon various similar tRNA molecules, it was thought they ""evolved from an common ancestor and should therefore be structurally related."" (Voet and Voet pg. 971-975) However, this was not the case as the, ""aaRSs form a diverse group of [over 100] enzymes … and there is little sequence similarity among synthetases specific for different amino acids."" (Voet and Voet pg. 971-975) Amazingly, these aaRSs themselves are coded for by the DNA: this forms the essence of a chicken-egg problem. The enzymes themselves build help perform the very task which constructs them!

Which came first, glycolysis to make energy or energy from glycolysis needed to make enzymes? Without the enzymes, glycolysis could not occur to produce ATP. But without the ATP those enzymes could not be manufactured. 10

A Simpler Origin for Life 11

DNA replication cannot proceed without the assistance of a number of proteins--members of a family of large molecules that are chemically very different from DNA. Proteins, like DNA, are constructed by linking subunits, amino acids in this case, together to form a long chain. Cells employ twenty of these building blocks in the proteins that they make, affording a variety of products capable of performing many different tasks--proteins are the handymen of the living cell. Their most famous subclass, the enzymes, act as expeditors, speeding up chemical processes that would otherwise take place too slowly to be of use to life. The above account brings to mind the old riddle: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? DNA holds the recipe for protein construction. Yet that information cannot be retrieved or copied without the assistance of proteins. Which large molecule, then, appeared first in getting life started--proteins (the chicken) or DNA (the egg)?


mRNA is needed to make the nuclear pore complex. But without the nuclear pore complex, mRNA cannot be prepared for translation in the Ribosome. Thats a catch22 situation....1

Chicken and Egg 2

Yarus's model also raises a significant chicken-and-egg paradox. Meyer and Nelson explain: Because those biosynthetic pathways involve many enzymes, extant cells would require a pre-existing translation system in order to make them. Since attempts to explain the origin of the genetic code are also attempts to explain the origin of the translation system (indeed, there can be no translation without a code), Yarus et al.'s findings raise an acute chicken and egg problem. Which came first, the aptamer-amino acid affinities that Yarus et al. propose as the basis of the code and translation system, or the translation system that would have been necessary to produce those amino acids (and, thus aptamer-amino acid affinities) in the first place?

A new chicken-and-egg paradox relating to the origin of life 12

Cells could not have evolved without viruses, as they need reverse transcriptase (which is found only in viruses) in order to move from RNA to DNA. In other words, instead of helping to solve the problem of the origin of life on Earth, recent research has only served to highlight one of its central paradoxes. And yet the science media reports the latest discoveries as if the solution is just around the corner. Don’t you find that just a little strange? “In order to move from RNA to DNA, you need an enzyme called reverse transcriptase,” Dolja said. “It’s only found in viruses like HIV, not in cells. So how could cells begin to use DNA without the help of a virus?” 13

Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:

A specific cellular tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS
Complementary DNA then binds to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA
A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the 5’ end of the RNA which removes the U5 and R region
The primer then ‘jumps’ to the 3’ end of the viral genome and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA
The first strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) is extended and the majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H
Once the strand is completed, second strand synthesis is initiated from the viral RNA
There is then another ‘jump’ where the PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand
Both strands are extended further and can be incorporated into the hosts genome by the enzyme integrase

Proteins are required to make proteins 14

The threat of autodestruction stems from the circular nature of protein synthesis. Proteins constitute many components of the cell's protein manufacturing machinery. In other words, the cell uses proteins to make proteins. So, if the protein manufacturing machinery were assembled with defective parts, the cell would fail to accurately manufacture proteins. Such a manufacturing failure would cause protein production systems to become increasingly error-prone with each successive round of protein synthesis. Protein manufacturing systems made up of defective components would be more likely to produce defective proteins. This chain reaction would cascade out of control and quite quickly lead to the cells self-destruction.  Effective quality assurance procedures must be in place for protein production or life would not be possible. 

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves strand transfer, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity

The process of DNA replication depends on many separate protein catalysts to unwind, stabilize, copy, edit, and rewind the original DNA message. In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication involves more than thirty specialized proteins to perform tasks necessary for building and accurately copying the genetic molecule. These specialized proteins include DNA polymerases, primases, helicases, topoisomerases, DNA-binding proteins, DNA ligases, and editing enzymes.38 DNA needs these proteins to copy the genetic information contained in DNA. But the proteins that copy the genetic information in DNA are themselves built from that information. This again poses what is, at the very least, a curiosity: the production of proteins requires DNA, but the production of DNA requires proteins.

“The ‘Catch-22’ of the origin of life is this: DNA can replicate, but it needs enzymes in order to catalyse the process. Proteins can catalyse DNA formation, but they need DNA to specify the correct sequence of amino acids.”  Indeed, the origin of the genetic code is a vicious circle: protein machines are needed to read the DNA, but these protein machines are themselves encoded on the DNA. Furthermore, they use energy, which requires ATP, made by the nano-motor ATP synthase. Yet this is encoded on the DNA, decoded by machines needing ATP. The proteins are the machinery, and the DNA is the reproductive material, yet both are needed at the same time for the cell to function at all. And of course, this would be useless without any information to reproduce .

Nar1 is both a target and a component of the cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis machinery creating an interesting “chicken and egg” situation for its maturation process (Balk et al., 2004). 5

How on earth could proofreading enzymes emerge, especially with this degree of fidelity, when they depend on the very information that they are designed to protect?  Think about it.  This is a catch-22 for Darwinists.  6

RNA synthesis requires RNA repair enzymes 7

A cell has a great investment in its RNAs – they are working copies of its genomic information.  The study of mRNA biogenesis in the last few years has revealed an elaborate surveillance mechanism involving factors such as the UPF proteins that culls aberrantly spliced mRNAs and mRNAs with premature termination codons.  There might be a hint that such RNA quality control mechanisms go awry in cancers, just as DNA quality control mechanisms do, where aberrantly spliced transcripts accumulate in a tumor.  Now that the gates are open, we may have a flood of studies on the RNome [the RNA genome] stability and cancer. 

This aggravates the chicken-and-egg problem for proponents of natural mechanisms.  In the “RNA World” hypothesis for the origin of life, RNA performed both the information storage and enzymatic functions before these roles were outsourced to DNA and proteins.  But how could RNA repair itself?  If RNA needs to be protected from damage, the protein repair system would have needed to be there from the beginning.  Proponents of natural mechanisms might surmise that different primitive RNAs worked side by side to repair each other, but that strains credibility for a hypothesis already far-fetched.
    In typical evolutionary lingo, Begley and Samson blow smoke about what nature produced (emphasis added): “It seems that, for each human protein, parameters have evolved to distinguish between RNA and DNA,” they speculate, and in another place, “It might be that the RNA-demethylation activity of AlkB-like proteins evolved to regulate biological RNA methylation, and that the repair of aberrant, chemical methylation is fortuitous.”  Ask them how the cell evolved these things, and you’ll probably get a quizzical look, as if “Why are you asking such a dumb question?  I don’t know.  It just had to.  We’re here, aren’t we?”

Recombination Vital to Genome Stability  8

The latest issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (July 17) contains a symposium on gene replication and recombination, among other papers on DNA.  Among the interesting papers:
(1) A theory on how genomes can contain vast stretches of non-coding DNA, apparently inactive retrotransposons that were inserted by recombination, polyploidy or lateral transfer.  These inactive stretches, while harmless, can greatly expand the genome while keeping the number of actual genes relatively constant.  
(2) A description of how recombination is an essential method for repair of DNA breaks, stating that “DNA synthesis is an accurate and very processive phenomenon; nevertheless, replication fork progression on chromosomes can be impeded by DNA lesions, DNA secondary structures, or DNA-bound proteins.  Elements interfering with the progression of replication forks have been reported to induce rearrangements and/or render homologous recombination essential for viability, in all organisms from bacteria to human.”  
(3) Another paper describes how specialized proteins called topoisomerases help prevent the strain of uncoiling DNA from breaking,  but when they fail, recombination can help restart the replication process.  
(4) A paper describes how recombination works to repair breaks in a replicating chromosome.  
(5) Some Japanese scientists describe how a gene codes for a motor protein that is essential for genome stability.
(6) The cover story describes the various repair mechanisms, stating, “Maintenance of genomic integrity and stable transmission of genetic information depend on a number of DNA repair processes.  Failure to faithfully perform these processes can result in genetic alterations and subsequent development of cancer and other genetic diseases.” Describing one such mechanism named Rad52, the authors state, “The key role played by Rad52 in this pathway has been attributed to its ability to seek out and mediate annealing of homologous DNA strands . . . . our data indicate that each Rad52 focus [i.e. active site] represents a center of recombinational repair capable of processing multiple DNA lesions.”


These are just samples of the exciting findings being made about DNA replication.  These and other papers show that it is a fail-safe system with many sophisticated backup and repair mechanisms.  While there is still much to learn, and many mysteries to explain, DNA’s ability to replicate is truly a marvel of engineering.  Think about the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum for evolution illustrated by (5) above: a gene codes for a protein that is essential for the gene to exist.  Browse through the abstracts of these papers just to get a feel for the amazingly complex world of cellular processes going on in your body right now, without your conscious thought or control.

You need energy to make energy 17

once Earth had pyrophosphite, it had an energetic molecule that, while not as useful as ATP, was at least somewhat similar.  “The team found that a compound known as pyrophosphite may have been an important energy source for primitive lifeforms.”  Did he have any evidence for this?  No; it’s just a requirement.  “It’s a chicken and egg question,” he said.  “Scientists are in disagreement over what came first – replication, or metabolism.  But there is a third part to the equation – and that is energy.”  So while scientists are disagreeing about two things, why not add a third?  That’s progress: “You need enzymes to make ATP and you need ATP to make enzymes,” explained Dr Kee, as if adding questions qualifies as explaining something: “The question is: where did energy come from before either of these two things existed?”  We may not know the answers, but at least our ignorance is getting more sophisticated thanks to OOL research.

The hardware and software of the cell, evidence of design 18

Paul Davies: the fifth miracle page 62
Due to the organizational structure of systems capable of processing algorithmic (instructional) information, it is not at all clear that a monomolecular system – where a single polymer plays the role of catalyst and informational carrier – is even logically consistent with the organization of information flow in living systems, because there is no possibility of separating information storage from information processing (that being such a distinctive feature of modern life). As such, digital–first systems (as currently posed) represent a rather trivial form of information processing that fails to capture the logical structure of life as we know it. 1

We need to explain the origin of both the hardware and software aspects of life, or the job is only half finished. Explaining the chemical substrate of life and claiming it as a solution to life’s origin is like pointing to silicon and copper as an explanation for the goings-on inside a computer. It is this transition where one should expect to see a chemical system literally take-on “a life of its own”, characterized by informational dynamics which become decoupled from the dictates of local chemistry alone (while of course remaining fully consistent with those dictates). Thus the famed chicken-or-egg problem (a solely hardware issue) is not the true sticking point. Rather, the puzzle lies with something fundamentally different, a problem of causal organization having to do with the separation of informational and mechanical aspects into parallel causal narratives. The real challenge of life’s origin is thus to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics.

Software and hardware are irreducible complex and interdependent. There is no reason for information processing machinery to exist without the software, and vice versa.
Systems of interconnected software and hardware are irreducibly complex.

All cellular functions are  irreducibly complex 19

Paul Davies, the fifth miracle page 53: 
Pluck the DNA from a living cell and it would be stranded, unable to carry out its familiar role. Only within the context of a highly specific molecular milieu will a given molecule play its role in life. To function properly, DNA must be part of a large team, with each molecule executing its assigned task alongside the others in a cooperative manner. Acknowledging the interdependability of the component molecules within a living organism immediately presents us with a stark philosophical puzzle. If everything needs everything else, how did the community of molecules ever arise in the first place? Since most large molecules needed for life are produced only by living organisms, and are not found outside the cell, how did they come to exist originally, without the help of a meddling scientist? Could we seriously expect a Miller-Urey type of soup to make them all at once, given the hit-and-miss nature of its chemistry?

Being part of a large team,cooperative manner,interdependability,everything needs everything else, are just other words for irreducibility and interdependence. 

For a nonliving system, questions about irreducible complexity are even more challenging for a totally natural non-design scenario, because natural selection — which is the main mechanism of Darwinian evolution — cannot exist until a system can reproduce. For an origin of life we can think about the minimal complexity that would be required for reproduction and other basic life-functions. Most scientists think this would require hundreds of biomolecular parts, not just the five parts in a simple mousetrap or in my imaginary LMNOP system. And current science has no plausible theories to explain how the minimal complexity required for life (and the beginning of biological natural selection) could have been produced by natural process before the beginning of biological natural selection.

Iron-sulfur clusters 20

Sulfur is an essential element, being a constituent of many proteins and cofactors. Iron-sulfur (FeS) centers are essential protein cofactors in all forms of life.  Various biosynthetic pathways were found to be tightly interconnected through complex crosstalk mechanisms that crucially depend on the bio-availability of the metal ions iron, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, copper, and zinc.  Proteins requiring Fe/S clusters in their active site have been localized in mitochondria, cytosol and nucleus where they are involved in rather diverse functions such as the TCA cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, bacterial and mitochondrial respiration, co-factor biosynthesis, ribosome assembly, regulation of protein translation, DNA replication and DNA repair. Hence the process of iron-sulphur biosynthesis is essential to almost all forms of life. The prevalence of these proteins on the metabolic pathways of most organisms leads some scientists to theorize that iron–sulfur compounds had a significant role in the origin of life in the iron–sulfur world theory. The iron–sulfur world hypothesis is a set of proposals for the origin of life and the early evolution of life advanced in a series of articles between 1988 and 1992 by Günter Wächtershäuser. FeS cluster assembly is a complex process involving the mobilisation of Fe and S atoms from storage sources, their assembly into [Fe-S] form, their transport to specific cellular locations, and their transfer to recipient apoproteins. Nar1 is a essential component of a cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly machinery. Required for maturation of extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins. 12  Thus, Nar1 is both a target and a component of the cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis machinery creating an interesting “chicken and egg” situation for its maturation process Conserved Iron–Sulfur (Fe–S) clusters are found in a growing family of metalloproteins that are implicated in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication and repair.  Therefore, they had to exist prior life began, since DNA replication enzymes and proteins depends on them. They require however also complex proteins and enzymes to be synthesized. Thats a classical chicken/egg problem.

Creationists/ID'ers often point to highly efficient and complex molecular systems such as catalytic protein complexes as evidence for divine design. Or to very specific and beautifully adapted organ structures, like gills or eyes.

However, some of the best examples of these molecular masterpieces of complexity are viruses. Now viruses have the most streamlined of genomes and they are ruthlessly efficient as they can hijack the complex regulation of cells by using just a handful of proteins of their own, and by coupling them with crafty and elegant mechanisms at the molecular level. This is what makes them a perfect example of an organism that is incredibly complex. To whit intelligently designed, right?

But wait, these very same Creationists/ID'ers they also claim that viruses are a result of the 'Fall From Grace', you know where human sin is the causal factor (not the god of Abraham), and the evolution of viruses is apparently micro evolution that doesn't come from the god of Abraham but from a type of evolution they accept.

So did the god of Abraham design these incredibly complex and deadly viruses, or did all this massive complexity just come about from evolution, you know random mutation followed by nature selection, post 'Fall From Grace'?

A review of Paul Davies book, the fifth miracle, about the genetic code. Starting at page 105:

I have described life as a deal struck between nucleic acids and proteins. However, these molecules inhabit very different chemical realms; indeed, they are barely on speaking terms. This is most clearly reflected in the arithmetic of information transfer. The data needed to assemble proteins are stored in DNA using the four-letter alphabet A, G, C, T. On the other hand, proteins are made out of twenty different sorts of amino acids. Obviously twenty into four won’t go. So how do nucleic acids and proteins communicate?
Earthlife has discovered a neat solution to this numerical mismatch by packaging the bases in triplets.

How could earthlife have discoverd a mechanism upon which life depends ? 

Four bases can be arranged in sixty-four different permutations of three, and twenty will go into sixty-four, with some room left over for redundancy and punctuation. The sequence of rungs of the DNA ladder thus determines, three by three, the exact sequence of amino acids in the proteins. To translate from the sixty-four triplets into the twenty amino acids means assigning each triplet (termed a codon) a corresponding amino acid. This assignment is called the genetic code. The idea that life uses a cipher was first suggested in the early 1950s by George Gamow, the same physicist who proposed the modern big-bang theory of the universe. As in all translations, there must be someone, or something, that is bilingual, in this case to turn the coded instructions written in nucleicacid language into a result written in amino-acid language. From what I have explained, it should be apparent that this crucial translation step occurs in living organisms when the appropriate amino acids are attached to the respective molecules of tRNA prior to the protein-assembly process.  This attachment is carried out by a group of clever enzymes  


cleverness is something we do usually assign to someone that is intelligent

that recognize both RNA sequences and the different amino acids, and marry them up accordingly with the right designation. 

The recognition must be PRE-PROGRAMMED. In the same manner, as a translator must learn two languages, in order to be able to assign one written word in english,  for example, to the written symbol in chinese with the same significance. There must be a previous common agreement of meaning before the translation process can begin. As for example, the word  translator, is written 翻譯者 in traditional chinese. Ask someone that does not speak chinese, to translate the word translator  into chinese . He has around 3500 different symbols to chose from. In the "" amino acid language"", there are 20 different amino acids to chose from.  The translator must know both, the word translator in english and in chinese, and know both written alphabets, previous to make the assignment. Only mental processes are able to do this. Chance is simply a impotent cause. 


William Dembsky:
http://www.discovery.org/a/1256
The problem is that nature has too many options and without design couldn’t sort through all those options. The problem is that natural mechanisms are too unspecific to determine any particular outcome. Natural processes could theoretically form a protein, but also compatible with the formation of a plethora of other molecular assemblages, most of which have no biological significance. Nature allows them full freedom of arrangement. Yet it’s precisely that freedom that makes nature unable to account for specified outcomes of small probability.Nature, in this case, rather than being intent on doing only one thing, is open to doing any number of things. Yet when one of those things is a highly improbable specified event, design becomes the more compelling, better  inference. Occam's razor also boils down to an argument from ignorance: in the absence of better information, you use a heuristic to accept one hypothesis over the other.



The genetic code, with a few recently discovered minor variations, is common to all known forms of life. That the code is universal is extremely significant, for it suggests it was used by the common ancestor of all life, and is robust enough to have survived through billions of years of evolution. Without it, the production of proteins would be a hopelessly hit-or-miss affair. Questions abound. How did such a complicated and specific system as the genetic code arise in the first place? Why, out of the 10 possible codes based on triplets, has nature chosen the one in universal use? Could a different code work as well? If there is life on Mars, will it have the same genetic code as Earthlife? Can we imagine uncoded life, in which interdependent molecules deal directly with each other on the basis of their chemical affinities alone? Or is the origin of the genetic code itself (or at least a genetic code) the key to the origin of life? The British biologist John Maynard Smith has described the origin of the code as the most perplexing problem in evolutionary biology. With collaborator Eörs Szathmáry he writes: “The existing translational machinery is at the same time so complex, so universal, and so essential that it is hard to see how it could have come into existence, or how life could have existed without it.” To get some idea of why the code is such an enigma, consider whether there is anything special about the numbers involved. Why does life use twenty amino acids and four nucleotide bases? It would be far simpler to employ, say, sixteen amino acids and package the four bases into doublets rather than triplets. Easier still would be to have just two bases and use a binary code, like a computer. If a simpler system had evolved, it is hard to see how the more complicated triplet code would ever take over. The answer could be a case of “It was a good idea at the time.” A good idea of whom ?  If the code evolved at a very early stage in the history of life, perhaps even during its prebiotic phase, the numbers four and twenty may have been the best way to go for chemical reasons relevant at that stage. Life simply got stuck with these numbers thereafter, their original purpose lost. Or perhaps the use of four and twenty is the optimum way to do it. There is an advantage in life’s employing many varieties of amino acid, because they can be strung together in more ways to offer a wider selection of proteins. But there is also a price: with increasing numbers of amino acids, the risk of translation errors grows. With too many amino acids around, there would be a greater likelihood that the wrong one would be hooked onto the protein chain. So maybe twenty is a good compromise. Do random chemical reactions have knowledge to arrive at a optimal conclusion, or a "" good compromise"" ?  

An even tougher problem concerns the coding assignments—i.e., which triplets code for which amino acids. How did these designations come about? Because nucleic-acid bases and amino acids don’t recognize each other directly, but have to deal via chemical intermediaries, there is no obvious reason why particular triplets should go with particular amino acids. Other translations are conceivable. Coded instructions are a good idea, but the actual code seems to be pretty arbitrary. Perhaps it is simply a frozen accident, a random choice that just locked itself in, with no deeper significance. 

That frozen accident means, that good old luck would have  hit the jackpot  trough trial and error amongst 1.5 × 1084 possible genetic codes . That is the number of atoms in the whole universe. That puts any real possibility of chance providing the feat out of question. Its , using  Borel's law, in the realm of impossibility.  1

Paul Hayden  The fundamental question is how these regularities of the standard code came into being, considering that there are more than 10 ^ 84 possible alternative code tables if each of the 20 amino acids and the stop signal are to be assigned to at least one codon. More specifically, the question is, what kind of interplay of chemical constraints, historical accidents, and evolutionary forces could have produced the standard amino acid assignment, which displays many remarkable properties.

And how could that make sense ? THINK !! 

On the other hand, there may be some subtle reason why this particular code works best. If one code had the edge over another, reliability-wise, then evolution would favor it

The problem once more is, that evolution could not be in play at this time and stage of affairs, since evolution only works upon replication. Replication depends on the machinery in question. Catch22.... 

, and, by a process of successive refinement, an optimal code would be reached. It seems reasonable.

DOES IT SEEM REASONABLE ? TO ME IT SEEMS UTMOST IRRATIONAL. IRRATIONAL TO THE EXTREME. So did random , unguided, non-intelligent chemicals have a pre-established goal to reach a optimal code? And even if that were the case, what good would it be without the translation machinery, the ribosome, fully set up aind in place, and doing its job ? 

But this theory is not without problems either. Darwinian evolution works in incremental steps, accumulating small advantages over many generations. In the case of the code, this won’t do. Changing even a single assignment would normally prove lethal, because it alters not merely one but a whole set of proteins. Among these are the proteins that activate and facilitate the translation process itself. So a change in the code risks feeding back into the very translation machinery that implements it, leading to a catastrophic feedback of errors that would wreck the whole process. To have accurate translation, the cell must first translate accurately. This conclusion seems paradoxical. A possible resolution has been suggested by Carl Woese. He thinks the code assignments and the translation mechanism evolved together. Initially there was only a rough-and-ready code, and the translation process was very sloppy. At this early stage, which is likely to have involved less than the present complement of twenty amino acids, organisms had to make do with very inefficient enzymes: the highly specific and refined enzymes life uses today had not yet evolved. Obviously some coding assignments would prove better than others, and any organism that employed the least error-prone assignments to code for its most important enzymes would be on to a winner.

Since when does dead matter have the intrinsic desire to get alive, and to win ? 

It would replicate more accurately, and in the process its coding arrangements would predominate among daughter cells. In this context, a “better” coding assignment would mean a robust one, so that, if there was a translation error, the same amino acid would nevertheless be made—i.e., there would be enough ambiguity for the error to make no difference. Or, in case the error did cause a different amino acid to be made, it would be a close cousin of the intended one, and the resulting protein would do the job almost as well. Successive refinements of this process might then lead to the universal code seen today—like a picture gradually coming into focus.

Now THAT was a great lecture of how to do pseudo-science, and assign to chance creative power that it does not have. 

The code may have an altogether deeper explanation. If a table of coding assignments is drawn up, it can be analyzed mathematically to see if there are any hidden patterns. Peter Jarvis and his colleagues at the University of Tasmania claim that the universal code conceals abstract sequences similar to the energy levels of atomic nuclei, and might even involve a subtle property of subatomic particles called supersymmetry. These mathematical correspondences may be purely coincidental, or they may point to some underlying connection between the physics of the molecules involved and the organization of the code. I have subjected the reader to the technicalities of the genetic code to make a general conceptual point that goes right to the heart of the mystery of life. Any coded input is merely a jumble of useless data unless an interpreter or a key is available. A coded message is only as good as the context in which it is put to use. That is to say, it has to mean something. In chapter 2, I drew the distinction between syntactic and semantic information. On their own, genetic data are mere syntax. The striking utility of encoded genetic information stems from the fact that amino acids “understand” it. The information distributed along a strand of DNA is biologically relevant. In computerspeak, genetic data are semantic data. For a clear perspective on this point, consider the way in which the four bases A, G, C, and T are arranged in DNA. As explained, these sequences are like letters in an alphabet, and the letters may spell out, in code, the instructions for making proteins. A different sequence of letters would almost certainly be biologically useless. Only a very tiny fraction of all possible sequences spells out a biologically meaningful message, in the same way that only certain very special sequences of letters and words constitute a meaningful book. Another way of expressing this is to say that genes and proteins require exceedingly high degrees of specificity in their structure. As I stated in my list of properties in chapter 1, living organisms are mysterious not for their complexity per se, but for their tightly specified complexity. To comprehend fully how life arose from nonlife, we need to know not only how biological information was concentrated, but also how biologically useful information came to be specified, given that the milieu from which the first organism emerged was presumably just a random mix of molecular building blocks. In short, how did meaningful information emerge spontaneously from incoherent junk?

I began this section by stressing the dual nature of biomolecules: they can be both hardware— particular three-dimensional forms—and software. The genetic code shows just how important the informational aspect of biomolecules is. The job of explaining the origin of life goes beyond finding a plausible chemical pathway out of a primordial soup. We need to know, conceptually, how mere hardware can give rise to software.

A while back a creationist, well to be truthful every creationist has at one time or another, made the assertion that random generation cannot ever end up with any form of recognizable information.  To back up this assertion they state that it would be the same as typing a random mess of characters on a keyboard and expecting words to appear.  Then to back up this assertion this particular creationist typed about 60 characters of random gibberish.

Interestingly enough when you actually looked at the string it did in fact contain words. But then you might say that the creationist in question might have typed real words as a result of muscle memory which would of course negate the observed results. So I decided to actually run an experiment that actually used random generated strings and then parse those strings for English words. (You know science)

So I wrote a simulator that generated 60 character random strings and then  I ignoring single character words parsed out all 2 to 10 character sequences in the string and compared them against a dictionary.  The routine was then run 1,000,000 times.  The results included up to 8 character words.

Iterations = 1,000,000

Total Tests = 503,000,000

Word length = 2, count = 7,151,190

Word length = 3, count = 2,674,758

Word length = 4, count = 373,686

Word length = 5, count = 25,679

Word length = 6, count = 1,617

Word length = 7, count = 77

Word length = 8, count = 3

Word length = 9, count = 0

Word length = 10, count = 0

Next I wondered what the results would be in I introduced a delimiter to treat each string as an individual word. So with the 26 letters I included a space as the word delimiter. So I wrote another simple routine to investigate this method of random word generation.  The routine was run 10 million times with the following results. 

Iterations = 10,000,000

Number of Words of Each Length

Word length = 2, count = 47,498

Word length = 3, count = 16,858

Word length = 4, count = 2,359

Word length = 5, count = 163

Word length = 6, count = 14

Word length = 7, count = 0

Word length = 8, count = 0

Word length = 9, count = 0

Word length = 10, count = 0

So as you can plainly see using the example, championed by the creationist, randomness does actually generate recognizable information.

From Marcos Eberlin's excellent book : Life and the Universe by Intelligent Design

https://www.widbook.com/ebook/life-and-the-universe-by-intelligent-design

 ATP synthase motor. The smallest and most efficient power plant on this planet powering the production of energy of Life. One of the essential requirements for Life is energy. Living organisms require large amounts of energy, and the molecule that stores and releases energy of life is adenosine triphosphate represented by the acronym ATP (Figure 2). And then there is a need for a huge amount of this molecule. And to synthesize it with efficiency and optimization, Life requires adenosine - a heterocyclic nitrogenous base, a ribose sugar molecule (one sugar) and three phosphates. Note the difficulty here for any unguided process  you ""want to imagine"" to form such a molecule. Sugars are formed by formaldehyde - essentially - a highly reactive molecule. Sugars are reactive and unstable, and reaction media that allow synthesis of sugars are incompatible with the means of synthesis of nitrogenous bases. Anions phosphate precipitate in the presence of metal ions such as Ca2 +, for example. And links between phosphate anions involve slow reactions, and need to be catalyzed by enzymes. Therefore, this molecule synthesis routes give a hell lot of work that only the machinery of life can perform. And to make matters worse for the task, the ATP molecule is unstable and hydrolyzes easily in water, and is exothermical (gives off heat). And then to establish the third phosphate connection, which requires most energy,  life must go against the kinetics and enthalpy and so uses the only way to overcome such cumber thermodynamic: a machine, and an incredible nanomachine: ATP synthase 

The ATP molecule - a chemical masterpiece- to generate the energy of Life.
The ATP synthase is the name given to a true nanomolecular ""power plant""  made by turbines and protein reactors, that in a spectacular and artfully crafted way, synthesizes - and reverse the synthesis - the molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine bifosfate) and anions of inorganic phosphate in the cells (Figure 1). A nanomolecular marvel of technology, chemistry and mechanical engineering mega intelligent.

 Carved like a work of chemical art , beautiful and awe-inspiring - it appears to challenge failed theories - ATP synthase has the smallest engine known in this universe. And this engine, professional thing, it performs like  a perfect and finely tuned ballet,  a synchronized set of thousands and thousands of inter- and intramolecular interactions. This plant also has input channels and output protons also artfully constructed with extreme skill and sophistication and astonishing precision, and nanometrical distances and forces set and finely calculated for the purpose of building a nanomolecular plant maximized to produce  chemical energy.

With a nanomolecular turbine powered by protons and which transmits its movement through a molecular rotor, and channels that direct the movement of these protons - kind of molecular slides to the water parks, the ATP synthase has fascinated many electrical and  chemical engineers primarily - for its perfection in performing reactions and producing energy. In it, we also have ""molecular pins"" that attach the rotor to the chemical reactor (F1 unit) catalyst, which accommodates within itself the reagents and literally confines them and ""Squeezes"", so as to accelerate the desired chemical reaction. And that tightens and loosens are all promoted by a synchronized spin - one opens and closes nanometrically set - governed by a molecular piece of oval shape crankshaft type in camshafts, those that man added to their combustion engines 
A fantastic chemical reaction then occurs in the ATP synthase: ADP + ATP → PO4-. And the whole machinery of ATP synthase is there fitted perfectly in the cell wall of the inner mitochondrial membrane , that hyper mega high tech "" cell ship"" . And all with homochiral molecules, AA type lefthanded only.

 The ATP synthase is therefore a show of sophistication, specification and aperiodicity, and hyper mega irreducible complexity . Disconnect one of its components, disturb one of its forms, replace some of your AA position, and there are thousands and thousands of them, and the system loses function altogether. Try to build it slowly, step by step, by mindless unguided processes, will it be possible? Viable at the molecular level? Where would the energy come from to build it, if it is the energy provider of life? Remember though that the energy that produces ATP synthase is essential to life, virtually for all forms of life. And it is power required  at the right time at the right flow! The structure of ATP synthase is so ingenious that its elucidation earned a Nobel Prize in 1997, as the enormity and significance of the feat. Our cells contain thousands of these nanomotors embedded in their mitochondria, and installed in their membranes. And these nanomotors - nano power plants - are about 200,000 times smaller than a pinhead. And that nanomotor is there for the sole purpose of forcing the occurrence of a single reaction: the third phosphate bond in ADP ""crushing it"" along with phosphate to form ATP 
The ATP molecules are used in key processes in the cell which require energy, which is released , then regenerating ADP and a free phosphate. The energy produced is directed, for example in humans, for contraction of muscles, beating of the heart and processes in the brain, whereas the reaction products are economically and wisely recycled . In the center of the ATP synthase is a small rotor which rotates around 100 revolutions per second, synthesizing 3 ATP molecules per revolution, or 300 molecules of ATP per second! Only for our thinking and walking, we recycle proportional to our body weight (80 kg) of ATP every day. Each enzyme in the ATP synthase is composed of 31 other proteins that, in turn, are made of thousands of amino acids precisely arranged. Remove any of the 31 proteins and the motor becomes simply useless.
The ATP synthase, along with the Scourge, is one of the most ""striking"" examples of mega irreducible complexity we see around the corner in life. And there's more: all the immense set of genetic information and RNA, plus dozens of proteins needed to build the ATP synthase, are in total even more irreducibly complex than the ATP synthase itself. The car factory is -by principle - more irreducibly complex than the car it manufactures.

Described in more details chemical and biochemical (insane task), the ATP synthase is a protein complex consisting of several proteins that fit perfectly synchronously, and - in a synchronized chemical ballet - in the form of a ""mushroom"". This nano mill is in thousands ""installed"" on the inner membrane of the mitochondria (Figure 6). There are two main components: (1) head - a spherical area comprised by the catalytic portion of the enzyme known as Factor connection 1, or simply F1, which measures about 90 Å in diameter; and (2) basic - called F0 - fixing the whole to the inner membrane of mitochondria. High resolution SEM micrographs revealed that the head (1) and the bottom part (2) are joined by a central rod - formed by subunits F1 and F0 - relatively narrow (45) which is connected to a peripheral button 90-100 Å in diameter. A mitochondria located in human liver cells has about 15,000 copies of ATP synthase

 The most efficient way to conduct a chemical reaction known in this universe, ""the hard way""! In the ATP synthase, a protein complex jointly embraces a ADP difosfate  molecule and one anion phosphate (Pi) providing energy and forcing them ""mechanically"" by reacting . Reaction occurred ""by force"", the engine spins at 8,500 RPM and the protein complex ""opens"" then its arms, by the action of the crankshaft driven by an engine and rotor, and releases the product, the tri-phosphate ATP molecule. The ATP synthase is the smallest rotary engine known today. To give you an idea of its tiny size, in a millimeter, can be grouped, side by side, approximately about 100 000 ATP synthases. This engine is driven not by power, but by ""proton energy""; that is, by a countercurrent flow of protons.
The ATP synthase would then be the headless product of evolution, not guided or inexcusable evidence of intelligent design? Remember that without energy there is no life, and in life there is no power without ATP, and in life there is no ATP without ATP synthase. The ATP synthase is thus more one of the great ""chicken-egg"" dilemmas  of Life! For all biochemical processes that coordinate the functioning and structure need to be supplied ATP synthase molecule itself produces: ATP. About 14 trillion body cells at this point are conducting this biochemical reaction via ATP synthase, in about a million times per minute through mitochondria.
To give you even more ingenius details of this fabulous machine, note that the F1 region of ATP synthase (F1-ATPase) is made up of six protein units, and divided into three pairs of active sites. These units form regions which provide ""chemical hugs"" through a docking site for ADP and phosphate. An anchoring (or stator) is curved on the outside of the structure in order to fix the base (F0) to the head (F1). Three molecules of ATP are formed for each complete shaft rotation. Chemical engineering of ATP synthase is  shown - there's no denying - intelligent and mega efficient . The complex has a spiral shaft, called ""Y"", which is the circumference between F0 and F1 and allows the connection of one region to the other, like a pen within a cardboard tube. The intelligent design of this nanomolecular machine causes the flow of protons, across the membrane, turn the shaft and the base. So it's not turning the base and the axis ""attracts"" the protons, as originally thought, but it is the flow of protons turning the engine. The turning occurs when the central axis (y) puts pressure on the inner walls of the six proteins in the F1 region thus result in a smooth structural deformation with consequent reformation alternately. My vote here for the ""pinnacle"" of chemical engineering in the nanomolecular this universe. Heck, what a  genius mind that knew Chemistry as anyone else, to come up with something like that!

Note further that the F0 subunit, which is fixed on the membrane of mitochondria, rotates clockwise. Laterally annexed the F0, is another input channel subunit which serves as the channel where the protons will be directed to the engine. The rotation is synchronized around its own axis and provides that individually protons enter and exit, respectively. Since the protons are attracted to the input channel, they connect to F0, and follow  nearly a complete rotation, they then are  conveyed to an output channel present on the same side frame attached to where F0 enters. The subunit F1 (F1 ATPase) is that attracts molecules adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (Pi), which are released together with ATP.

3D view at the molecular level of ATP synthase: nano power plant vital to life on this planet.

But there is even more wonder in the ATP synthase: the rotational mechanism used for F0 is performed routinely when there is a high concentration of protons in the cytosol and a low concentration of ATP inside the mitochondria. But when these concentrations are reversed, the enzyme "" understands biochemically"" that its function was successful, and if it continues, will promote serious imbalance in the cell. Control is everything! In this situation, the ATP synthase ""thinks and reacts,"" and and makes its F0 turn now in the opposite direction, and the mechanism is reversed, and the proton exit channel now becomes the input channel, and the  protons inside the organelle return to the cytosol. ATP molecules are now converted to ADP and phosphate free, in a chemical ""retro-reaction"" . A chemical balance nano-mechanically directed and controlled! Since you know this fantastic nanomachine a little better  at the molecular level, , what do you think: chance or design?

DebateEvolution,3xmvuq,RapingAbortedFetuses,,,self.DebateEvolution,,The reason why the vast majority of people are in support of Evolution and why it is biased,"[According to the NCSE](http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/many-scientists-see-gods-hand-evolution) (an evolution advocacy group) 55% of scientists are atheists, 40% believe God guided evolution, and 5% are young earth creationists.  The survey had no category for old earth creationists and they don't break it down by field, so  the results aren't perfect.  

I don't like to profile large groups of people I've never met and I think the reasons for evolutionary theory's widespred acceptance are complex and multifaceted.  But I'd guess it involves some of the following:

1.  Many immediately reject creation or ID from the many embarrassingly bad ""why are there still monkeys"" arguments used by laymen.  They assume there's nothing beyond that and never dig deeper to encounter the good arguments.

2.  It's what they were taught in school and they never questioned it.  ""I didn't give it much thought; It wasn't my area of concern"", Michael Behe [reflected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9SmPNQrQHE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2m00s) of his postdoc research days.  ""college students have not been shown the weakness of Darwinian evolution"" as Joseph Kuhn [published in 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246854/?report=classic).

3.  Many don't know about issues outside their narrow field.  Paleontologist and ID critic Don Prothero [wrote that](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ptb/6959004.0001.001/--stephen-jay-gould-did-he-bring-paleontology-to-the-high?rgn=main;view=fulltext) ""Nearly all metazoans [meaning animals] show stasis, with almost no good examples of gradual evolution... the prevalence of stasis is a puzzle that has no simple answer"" but lamented, ""by and large the neontological [non-paleontologist] community still 'doesn't get it'... The journal Evolution continues to publish almost no contributions by paleontologists"".  Ironically I've also seen geneticists cite the fossil record as evidence for evolution when genes don't form trees.

4.  Others don't talk about the problems.  Renowned chemist James Tour [describes](http://youtu.be/PZrxTH-UUdI?t=52m3s), ""Let me tell you what goes on in the back rooms of science – with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. I have sat with them, and when I get them alone... I say, ""Do you understand all of this, where all of this came from, and how this happens?"" Every time that I have sat with people who are synthetic chemists, who understand this, they go 'Uh-uh. Nope.' These people are just so far off, on how to believe this stuff came together. I've sat with National Academy members, with Nobel Prize winners. Sometimes I will say, 'Do you understand this?' And if they’re afraid to say 'Yes,' they say nothing. They just stare at me, because they can’t sincerely do it.""

5.  Many see anything but materialistic naturalism as a violation of scientific professionalism.  One reporter described of [a conference in China](http://www.fredheeren.com/washtimes.htm), ""Chinese scientists encouraged the investigation of a variety of new hypotheses to explain the Cambrian explosion: hydrothermal eruptions, sudden seafloor changes, even intelligent design. This last was too much for one American paleontologist who stood up and shouted, 'This is not a scientific conference!'"".  Likewise, as [Lynn Margulis said](http://discovermagazine.com/2011/apr/16-interview-lynn-margulis-not-controversial-right), ""The critics, including the creationist critics, are right about their criticism. It’s just that they've got nothing to offer but intelligent design or 'God did it.'""

6.  Many biologists don't understand engineering.  Many of the patterns claimed to only arise by common descent are the same I see in my own code.

7.  Some recognize insufficiencies but hope new theories will arise to resolve them.  [Depew &amp;amp; Weber published in 2012](http://ge.tt/8zEY5DM/v/0?c): ""Darwinism in its current scientific incarnation has pretty much reached the end of its rope...  however, we are confident that a new and more general theory of evolution is evolving""

8.  A bias toward sensationalism in the media--which is true everywhere and not just with evolutionary biology.

9.  Those who disagree are rarely given a voice, and are often forced to move on to careers outside biology.  Creation evolutionary biologist Todd Wood's response to critic Phil Senter was ""declined [without review](http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2012/10/im-still-here.html) by 4 different journals"".  Without review means they didn't read them.  Probably due to some of the reasons above,  Yet being unable publish reinforces the cycle.

10.  The more vocal opponents successfully prevent journals from publishing papers questioning evolutionary theory by [threatening boycott](http://www.evolutionnews.org/2013/08/on_the_origin_o_3075521.html).  Even when the papers have already passed peer review.  Thankfully the papers were peer reviewed again by another journal and [still published](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8818).

10.  A small number of rather popular evolution ""evangelists"" shame anyone who dissents from the party line.  For example see [Jerry Coyne's response](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/lynn-margulis-disses-evolution-in-discover-magazine-embarrasses-both-herself-and-the-field/) to Lynn Margulis claiming evolution doesn't work (cited above).  Coyne says she's ""dogmatic, willfully ignorant, and intellectually dishonest"", ""wrong in the worst way a scientist can be wrong"", and ""embarrasses both herself and the field"". He and others write those accusations against anyone mentioning problems.

Some steps to consider in regard of factory planning, design and operation

All text in red requires INTELLIGENCE :

Choosing Manufacturing   and Factory location
Selecting Morphology of Factory Types
Factory planning
Factory design
Information management within factory planning and design
Factory layout planning
Equipment supply
Process planning
Production Planning and Control
establishing various internal and external  Communication networks 
Establishing Quantity and Variant Flexibility
The planning of either a rigid or flexible volume concept depending of what is required
Establishing Networking and Cooperation
Establishing Modular organization
Size and internal factory space organization, compartmentalization and layout 
Planning of recycling Economy
Waste management
Controlled factory implosion programming

All these procedures and operational steps are required and implemented in human factories, and so in biological cells which operate like factories. It takes a lot of faith to believe, human factories require intelligence, but cells, far more complex and elaborated, do not require intelligence to make them, and intelligent programming to work in a self sustaining and self replicating manner, and to self disctruct, when required.  

Molecular machines: 

The most complex molecular machines are proteins found within cells. 1 These include motor proteins, such as myosin, which is responsible for muscle contraction, kinesin, which moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along microtubules, and dynein, which produces the axonemal beating of motile cilia and flagella. These proteins and their nanoscale dynamics are far more complex than any molecular machines that have yet been artificially constructed.

Probably the most significant biological machine known is the ribosome. Other important examples include ciliary mobility. A high-level-abstraction summary is that, ""[i]n effect, the [motile cilium] is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines."" Flexible linker domains allow the connecting protein domains to recruit their binding partners and induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics.

Someone can object and say, that human invented machines do nor replicate, and therefor the comparison is invalid. Fact is however, that replication adds further complexity , since humans have not been able to construct self replicating machines in large scale. This is imho what every living cell is able and programmed to do. In order to so so, extremely complex celluar mechanisms are required, like DNA replication.

DNA replication is the most crucial step in cellular division, a process necessary for life, and errors can cause cancer and many other diseases. Genome duplication presents a formidable enzymatic challenge, requiring the high fidelity replication of millions of bases of DNA. It is a incredible system involving a city of proteins, enzymes, and other components that are breathtaking in their complexity and efficiency. 

How do you get a living cell capable of self-reproduction from a “protein compound … ready to undergo still more complex changes”? Dawkins has to admit:

“Darwin, in his ‘warm little pond’ paragraph, speculated that the key event in the origin of life might have been the spontaneous arising of a protein, but this turns out to be less promising than most of Darwin’s ideas. … But there is something that proteins are outstandingly bad at, and this Darwin overlooked. They are completely hopeless at replication. They can’t make copies of themselves. This means that the key step in the origin of life cannot have been the spontaneous arising of a protein.” (pp. 419–20)

The process of DNA replication depends on many separate protein catalysts to unwind, stabilize, copy, edit, and rewind the original DNA message. In prokaryotic cells, DNA replication involves more than thirty specialized proteins to perform tasks necessary for building and accurately copying the genetic molecule. These specialized proteins include DNA polymerases, primases, helicases, topoisomerases, DNA-binding proteins, DNA ligases, and editing enzymes. DNA needs these proteins to copy the genetic information contained in DNA. But the proteins that copy the genetic information in DNA are themselves built from that information. This again poses what is, at the very least, a curiosity: the production of proteins requires DNA, but the production of DNA requires proteins. 

Proponents of Darwinism are at a loss to tell us how this marvelous system began.  Charles Darwin's main contribution, natural selection, does not apply until a system can reproduce all its parts.  Getting a reproducible cell in a primordial soup is a giant leap, for which today's evolutionary biologists have no answer, no evidence, and no hope.  It amounts to blind faith to believe that undirected, purposeless accidents somehow built the smallest, most complex, most efficient system known to man.

Several decades of experimental work have convinced us that DNA synthesis and replication actually require a plethora of proteins. 

Replication of the genetic material is the single central property of living systems. Dawkins provocatively claimed that organisms are but vehicles for replicating and evolving genes, and I believe that this simple concept captures a key aspect of biological evolution. All phenotypic features of organisms—indeed, cells and organisms themselves as complex physical entities—emerge and evolve only inasmuch as they are conducive to genome replication. That is, they enhance the rate of this process, or, at least, do not impede it. 

DNA replication is an enormously complex process with many different components that interact to ensure the faithful passing down of genetic components that interact to ensure the faithful passing down of genetic information to the next generation. A large number of parts have to work together to that end. In the absence of one or more of a number of the components, DNA replication is either halted completely or significantly compromised, and the cell either dies or becomes quite sick. Many of the components of the replication machinery form conceptually discrete sub-assemblies with conceptually discrete functions.

Wiki mentions that a key feature of the DNA replication mechanism  is that it is designed to replicate relatively large genomes rapidly and with high fidelity. Part of the cellular machinery devoted to  DNA replication and DNA-repair. The regulation of DNA replication is a vital cellular process. It is controlled by a series of mechanisms. One point of control is by modulating the accessibility of replication machinery components ( called the replisome )  to the single origin (oriC) region on the DNA. DNA replication should take place only when a cell is about to divide. If DNA replication occurs too frequently, too many copies of the bacterial chromosome will be found in each cell. Alternatively, if DNA replication does not occur frequently enough, a daughter cell will be left without a chromosome. Therefore, cell division in bacterial cells must be coordinated with DNA replication.

In prokaryotes, the DNA is circular.  Replication starts at a single origin (ori C) and is bi-directional. The region of replicating DNA associated with the single origin is called a replication bubble  and consists of two replication forks moving in opposite direction around the DNA circle. During DNA replication, the two parental strands separate and each acts as a template to direct the enzyme catalysed synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand following the normal base pairing rule. At least 10 different enzymes or proteins  participate in the initiation phase of replication. Three basic steps involved in DNA replication are Initiation, elongation and termination, subdivided in eight discrete steps.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4365

Initiation phase: 

Step 1: Initiation begins, when DNA binds around an initiator protein complex DnaA with the goal to pull the two DNA strands apart. That  creates a number of problems. First of all, the two strands like to be together - they stick to each other just as if they had tiny magnets up and down their length. In order to pull apart the DNA you have to put energy into the system. In modern cells, a protein called DnaA  binds to a specific spot along the DNA, called single origin ( oriC ) and the protein proceeds to open up the double strand. The protein is a monomer, has motifs to bind to unique monomer sites, also they have motifs for protein-protein interaction, thus they can form clusters.   They have hydrophobic regions for helical coiling and protein–protein interactions.  Binding of the monomers to DnaA-A boxes, in ATP dependent manner (proteins have ATPase activity), leads to cooperative binding of more proteins.  This clustering of proteins on DNA makes the DNA to wrap around the proteins, which induces torsional twist and it is this left handed twist that makes DNA to melt at 13-mer region and AT rich region; perhaps the negative super helical topology in this region may further facilitate the melting of the DNA. Opening or unwinding of dsDNA ( double strand DNA )  into single stranded region is an important event in initiation.

Unwinding the DNA Double Helix Requires DNA Helicases,Topoisomerases, and Single- Stranded DNA Binding Proteins
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4374

Step 2:  During DNA replication, the two strands of the double helix must unwind at each replication fork to expose the single strands to the enzymes responsible for copying them. Three classes of proteins with distinct functions facilitate this unwinding process: DNA helicases, topoisomerases, and single-stranded DNA binding proteins ( SSB's). Helicase ( DnaB ) now comes along. The helicase exposes a region of single-stranded DNA that must be kept open for copying to proceed. Helicase is like a snowplow; it is a molecular machine that plows down the middle of the double helix, pushing apart the two strands. this allows the polymerase and associated proteins to travel along behind it in ease and comfort.  DnaB helicase alone has no affinity for ssDNA ( single stranded DNA ) bound by SSB (single- stranded binding protein). Thus, entry of the DnaB helicase complex into the unwound oriC depends on DnaC, a  additional protein factor. DnaC helps or facilitates the helicase to be loaded onto ssDNA  at the replication fork in ATP dependent manner. The DnaB-DnaC complex forms a topologically open, three-tiered toroid.  DnaC remodels DnaB to produce a cleft in the helicase ring suitable for DNA passage. DnaC’s  fold is dispensable for DnaB loading and activation. DnaB possesses autoregulatory elements that control helicase loading and unwinding. Using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, these proteins unwind the DNA double helix in advance of the replication fork, breaking the hydrogen bonds as they go. Helicase recruitment and loading in bacteria is a remarkable process. Following video shows how that works: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzNuLsqMqyE




There is a problem, though, with this setup. If you push apart two DNA strands they generally do not float around separately. If they are close to one another they will rapidly snap back and form a double strand again almost as soon as the helicase passes. Even if the strands are not near each other, a single strand will usually fold up and form hydrogen bonds with itself - in other words, a tangled mess. So it is not enough to push apart the two strands of DNA; there must be a way to keep the strands apart once they have been separated. In modern cells this job is done by single-strand binding proteins, or SBB's. As the helicase separates the strands of DNA, SSB's bind to the single stranded DNA and coats them.   . SSB's prevent DNA from reannealing. SSB's associate to form tetramers around which the DNA is wrapped in a manner that significantly compacts the single-stranded DNA. There is another difficulty in being a double helix. The unwinding associated with DNA replication would create an intolerable amount of supercoiling and possibly tangling in the rest of the DNA. It can be illustrated with a simple example. Take two interwined shoe laces and ask a friend to hold them together at each end. Now take a pencil, insert it between the strands near one end, and start pushing it down toward the other end. As you can see, shoestrings behind the pencil become melted, in the jargon of biochemistry. The shoestrings ahead of the pencil become more and more tangled. It becomes harder and harder to push the pencil forward.  Helicase and polymerase encounter the same problem with DNA. It does not matter wheter you are talking about interwined strings or interwined DNA strands. The problem of tangling is the result of the topological interconnectness of the two strands. If this problem persisted for very long in a  cell, DNA replication would grind to a halt. However, the cell contains several enzymes, called topoisomerases, to take care of the difficulty. The way in which they do so can be illustrated with a enzyme called gyrase. Gyrase binds to DNA, pulls them apart and allows a separate portion of the DNA to pass through the cut. It then reseals the cut and lets go of the DNA. This action decreases the number of twists in DNA. The parental DNA is unwound by DNA helicases and SSB (travels in 5’-3’ direction), the resulting positive super-coiling (torsional stress) is relieved by topoisomerse I and II (DNA gyrase) by inducing transient single stranded breaks.Topoisomerases are amazing enzymes. In this topic, a video shows how they function : 

Topoisomerase II enzymes, amazing evidence of design
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2111-topoisomerase-ii-enzymes-amazing-evidence-of-design?highlight=topoisomerase

In modern organisms, helicase, SSB, and gyrase all are required at the replication fork. Mutants in which any of them are missing are not viable - they die.

Question : Had not all three parts , the SSB binding proteins, the topoisomerase, and the helicase and the DnaC loading proteins not have to be there all at once, otherwise, nothing goes ? They might exercise their function but their own, but then they would not replicate DNA or have function in a bigger picture. Its evident that they had to come together to provide a functional whole.  What we see here are highly coordinated , goal oriented tasks with specific  movements designed to provide a specific outcome. Auto-regulation and control   that seems required beside constant energy supply through ATP enhances the difficulty to make the whole mechanism work in the right manner. All this is awe inspiring and evidences the wise guidance and intelligence required to make all this happening in the right way.

Step 3:  The enzyme DNA primase (primase, an RNA polymerase)  attaches to the DNA and synthesizes a short RNA primer to initiate synthesis of the leading strand of the first replication fork.

Elongation phase : 

Step 4: In the elongation fase, DNA polymerase III extends the RNA primer made by primase.

DNA Polymerase
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4375

DNA polymerase possesses separate catalytic sites for polymerization and degradation of nucleic acid strands. All DNA polymerases make DNA in 5’-3’ direction . A ring-shaped sliding clamp protein encircles the DNA double helix and binds to DNA polymerase, thereby allowing the DNA polymerase to slide along the DNA while remaining firmly attached to it. Most enzymes work by colliding with their substrate, catalyzing a reaction and dissociating from the product. If that were the case with DNA polymerase, then it would bind to DNA, add a nucleotide to the new chain that was being made, and then fall off of the chain. Then ,put the next nucleotide onto the growing end,  bind it and catalyze the addition. This same cycle would have to repeat itself a very large number of times to complete a new DNA chain. Polymerases however catalyze the addition of a nucleotide but do not fall off the DNA. Rather, they stay bound to it, until the next nucleotide comes in, and then they catalyze its addition to the chain. and they again stay bound. If it were not so, the replication process would be very slow. In the cell, polymerases stay on the DNA until their job is completed, which might be only after millions of nucleotides have been joined. This velocity is only possible because of clamp proteins. These have a ring shape. The ring can be opened up.  These clamp proteins are joined to the DNA polymerase in a intricate way, through a clamp loader protein, which has a remarkable shape similar to a human hand. It takes the clamp, like a hand with five fingers would grab it, opens it up becoming like a doughnut shape,where the whole hole in the middle is big enough to accommodate the DNA,  and then, when it is on the DNA, it positions it in a precise manner on the DNA polymerase, where it stays bound until it reaches the end of its polymerizing job. Through this ingenious process, the clamp stabilizes the DNA, making it possible to increase the speed of polymerization dramatically.  They can be seen here:

The sliding clamp and clamp loader
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4376

Question : How would and could natural , unguided processes have figured out 1. the requirement of high-speed of polymerization ? How could they have figured out the right configuration and process to do so ? how could natural processes have emerged with the right proteins incrementally, with the hand-shaped clamp loader, and the precisely fitting clamp , enabling the fast process ?? Even the most intelligent scientists are still not able to imagine how this process is engineered ?  Furthermore, the process requires molecular energy in the form of ATP, and everything must fit together, and be functional. Without the clamp loader protein, the clamp could not be positioned to the polymerase enzyme, and processivity would not rise to the required speed. The whole process must also be regulated and controlled. How could that regulation have been programmed ? Trial and error ? 

Several Proteins Are Required for DNA Replication at the Replication Fork
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4398

The various proteins involved in DNA replication are all closely associated in one large complex, called a replisome.  
Leading strand synthesis:  On the template strand with 3’-5’ orientation, new DNA is made continuously in 5’-3’ direction towards the replication fork. The new strand that is continuously synthesized in 5’-3’ direction is the leading strand. 
Lagging strand synthesis: In the lagging strand, the synthesis of DNA also elongates in a 5ʹ to 3ʹ manner, but it does so in the direction away from the replication fork. In the lagging strand, RNA primers must repeatedly initiate the synthesis of short segments of DNA; thus, the synthesis has to be discontinuous.

The Primase (DnaG) enzyme, and the primosome complex
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4379

 The length of these fragments in bacteria is typically 1000 to 2000 nucleotides. In eukaryotes, the fragments are shorter—100 to 200 nucleotides. Each fragment contains a short RNA primer at the 5ʹ end, which is made by primase. The remainder of the fragment is a strand of DNA made by DNA polymerase III. The DNA fragments made in this manner are known as Okazaki fragments. To complete the synthesis of Okazaki fragments within the lagging strand, three additional events must occur: removal of the RNA primers, synthesis of DNA in the area where the primers have been removed, and the covalent attachment of adjacent fragments of DNA. In E. coli, the RNA primers are removed by the action of DNA polymerase I. This enzyme has a 5ʹ to 3ʹ exonuclease activity, which means that DNA polymerase I digests away the RNA primers in a 5ʹ to 3ʹ direction, leaving a vacant area. DNA polymerase I then synthesizes DNA to fill in this region. It uses the 3ʹ end of an adjacent Okazaki fragment as a primer. , DNA polymerase I would remove the RNA primer from the first Okazaki fragment and then synthesize DNA in the vacant region by attaching nucleotides to the 3ʹ end of the second Okazaki fragment. After the gap has been completely filled in, a covalent bond is still missing between the last nucleotide added by DNA polymerase I and the adjacent DNA strand that had been previously made by DNA polymerase III. To the left of the origin, the top strand is made continuously, whereas to the right of the origin it is made in Okazaki fragments. By comparison, the synthesis of the bottom strand is just the opposite. To the left of the origin it is made in Okazaki fragments and to the right of the origin the synthesis is continuous. Finally the two ends of the fragment have to be joined together; this is the job of an enzyme called DNA ligase.  After the completion of one Okazaki fragment , the equipment has to be released, the clamp has to let go, and a new clamp has to be loaded at the beginning of the next fragment. Clearly the formation and control of the replication fork is an enormously complex process. 

Step 5:   After DNA synthesis by DNA pol III, DNA polymerase I uses its 5’-3’ exonuclease activity to remove the RNA primer and fills the gaps with new DNA. In the next step, finally DNA ligase joins the ends of the DNA fragments together.  As the replisome moves along the DNA in the direction of the replication fork, it must accommodate the fact that DNA is being synthesized in opposite directions along the template on the two stands. Picture above  provides a schematic model illustrating how this might be accomplished by folding the lagging strand template into a loop.Creating such a loop allows the DNA polymerase molecules on both the leading and lagging strands to move in the same physical direction, even though the two template strands are oriented with opposite polarity. The replisome faces special challenges as it makes new DNA at rates that can approach 1,000 nucleotides per second. Unlike the machines that make proteins and RNA, which work relatively sluggishly and in a linear fashion, the replisome must simultaneously copy two strands of DNA that are aligned in opposite directions (5ʹ to 3ʹ and 3ʹ to 5ʹ). Replisome chemistry obeys two rules. 


Questions: How did they arise with that cabability to "" obey two rules "" ?  Suppose a primitive polymerase were duplicated and somehow started to replicate the second strand in the opposite direction while remaining attached to the first strand -  how could that change have been directed , and why should that feat have happened randomly ? 




The DNA polymerase holoenzyme alone would not be able to duplicate the long DNA faithfully. Tests have shown that Polymerase III alone gets stuck. Furthermore, Polymerase III is not a simple enzyme. Its rather three enzymes in one. Beside replicating DNA, it can also degrade DNA in two different ways. It does so by three different, discrete regions of the molecule. The exonuclease activity plays a critical role in replication. It allows the enzyme to proofread the new DNA and cut out any mistakes it has made. Although the polymerase reads the sequence of the old DNA to produce a new DNA, it turns out that simple base bairing allows about one mistake per thousand base pairs copied. Proofreading reduces errors to about one mistake in a million base pairs. The question is if wheter  a proofreading exonuclease and other DNA repair mechanisms had to be present in the very first cell. 

Eigen’s theory revealed the existence of the fundamental limit on the fidelity of replication (the Eigen threshold): If the product of the error (mutation) rate and the information capacity (genome size) is below the Eigen threshold, there will be stable inheritance and hence evolution; however, if it is above the threshold, the mutational meltdown and extinction become inevitable (Eigen, 1971). The Eigen threshold lies somewhere between 1 and 10 mutations per round of replication (Tejero, et al., 2011) regardless of the exact value, staying above the threshold fidelity is required for sustainable replication and so is a prerequisite for the start of biological evolution. Indeed, the very origin of the first organisms presents at least an appearance of a paradox because a certain minimum level of complexity is required to make self-replication possible at all; high-fidelity replication requires additional functionalities that need even more information to be encoded (Penny, 2005). The crucial question in the study of the origin of life is how the Darwin-Eigen cycle started—how was the minimum complexity that is required to achieve the minimally acceptable replication fidelity attained? In even the simplest modern systems, such as RNA viruses with the replication fidelity of only about 10^3 and viroids that replicate with the lowest fidelity among the known replicons (about 10^2; Gago, et al., 2009), replication is catalyzed by complex protein polymerases. The replicase itself is produced by translation of the respective mRNA(s), which is mediated by the immensely complex ribosomal apparatus. Hence, the dramatic paradox of the origin of life is that, to attain the minimum complexity required for a biological system to start on the Darwin-Eigen spiral, a system of a far greater complexity appears to be required. How such a system could evolve is a  puzzle that defeats conventional evolutionary thinking, all of which is about biological systems moving along the spiral; the solution is bound to be unusual. 

DNA damage and repair
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2043-dna-repair?highlight=dna+repair
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p30-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4401

Replication forks may stall frequently and require some form of repair to allow completion of chromosomal duplication. Failure to solve these replicative problems comes at a high price, with the consequences being genome instability, cell death and, in higher organisms, cancer. Replication fork repair and hence reloading of DnaB may be needed away from oriC at any point within the chromosome and at any stage during chromosomal duplication. The potentially catastrophic effects of uncontrolled initiation of chromosomal duplication on genome stability suggests that replication restart must be regulated as tightly as DnaA-directed replication initiation at oriC. This implies reloading of DnaB must occur only on ssDNA at repaired forks or D-loops rather than onto other regions of ssDNA, such as those created by blocks to lagging strand synthesis.Thus an alternative replication initiator protein, PriA helicase, is utilized during replication restart to reload DnaB back onto the chromosome 

Question: Could the first cell, with its required complement of genes coded for by DNA, have successfully reproduced for a significant number of generations without a proofreading function ? A further question is how the function of synthesis of the lagging strand could have arisen, and the machinery to do so. That is, the Primosome, and the function of Polymerase I to remove the short peaces of RNA that the cell uses to prime replication, allowing the polymerase III function to fill the gap. These functions all require precise regulation, and coordinated functional machine-like steps. These are all complex, advanced functions and had to be present right from the beginning. How could this complex machinery have emerged in a gradual manner ? the Primosome had to be fully functional, otherwise polymerisation could not have started, since a prime sequence is required.

Step 6: Finally DNA ligase joins the ends of the DNA fragments together.

Termination phase: 

Termination of DNA replication
http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t1849p15-dna-replication-of-prokaryotes#4399

Step 7: The two replication forks meet ~ 180  degree opposite to ori C, as DNA is circular in prokaryotes. Around this region there are several terminator sites which arrest the movement of forks by binding to the tus gene product, an inhibitor of helicase (Dna B).
Step 8: Once replication is complete, the two double stranded circular DNA molecules (daughter strands) remain interlinked. Topoisomerase II makes double stranded cuts to unlink these molecules.

According to mainstream scientific papers, the following twenty protein and protein complexes are essential for prokaryotic DNA replication. Each one mentioned below. They cannot be reduced. If one is missing, DNA replication cannot occur:

DiaA this novel protein plays an important role in regulating the initiation of chromosomal replication via direct interactions with the DnaA initiator.
DAM methylase  It’s gene expression requires full methylation of GATC at its promoter region. 
DnaB helicase Helicases are essential enzymes for DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms.
DnaC Loading of the DnaB helicase is the key step in replication initiation.  DnaC is essential for replication in vitro and in vivo. 
HU-proteins  HU protein is required for proper synchrony of replication initiation
SSB Single-stranded binding proteins  Single-stranded DNA binding proteins are essential for the sequestration and processing of single-stranded DNA. 6
SSBs from the OB domain family play an essential role in the maintenance of genome stability, functioning in DNA replication, the repair of damaged DNA, the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and in telomere maintenance. SSB proteins play an essential role in DNA metabolism by protecting single-stranded DNA and by mediating several important protein–protein interactions. 7
Hexameric DNA helicases DNA helicases are essential during DNA replication because they separate double-stranded DNA into single strands allowing each strand to be copied.
DNA polymerase I and III DNA polymerase 3 is essential for the replication of the leading and the lagging strands whereas DNA polymerase 1 is essential for removing of the RNA primers from the fragments and replacing it with the required nucleotides. 
DnaG Primases  They are essential for the initiation of such phenomena because DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo synthesis and can only elongate existing strands 
Topoisomerases  are essential in the separation of entangled daughter strands during replication. This function is believed to be performed by topoisomerase II in eukaryotes and by topoisomerase IV in prokaryotes. Failure to separate these strands leads to cell death. 
Sliding clamp and clamp loader the clamp loader is a crucial aspect of the DNA replication machinery.  Sliding clamps are DNA-tracking platforms that are essential for processive DNA replication in all living organisms 
Primase (DnaG) Primases are essential RNA polymerases required for the initiation of DNA replication, lagging strand synthesis and replication restart.  They are essential for the initiation of such phenomena because DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo synthesis and can only elongate existing strands. 
RTP-Ter complex Ter sequences would not seem to be essential, but they may prevent overreplication by one fork in the event that the other is delayed or halted by an encounter with DNA damage or some other obstacle
Ribonuclease H  RNase H1 plays essential roles in generating and clearing RNAs that act as primers of DNA replication. 
Replication restart primosome Replication restart primosome is a complex dynamic system that is essential for bacterial survival. 
DNA repair: 
RecQ helicase  In prokaryotes RecQ is necessary for plasmid recombination and DNA repair from UV-light, free radicals, and alkylating agents. 
RecJ nuclease the repair machinery must be designed to act on a variety of heterogeneous DNA break sites.

I do not know of any scientific paper  that explains in a detailed manner how DNA replication de novo or any of its parts might have emerged in a naturalistic manner, without involving intelligence. The systems responsible for DNA replication are well beyond the explanatory power of unguided natural processes without guiding intelligence involved. Indeed, machinery of the complexity and sophistication of that described above is, is in my view best explained through a intelligent designer.

Precisely BECAUSE WE KNOW that each of the described and mentioned parts is indispensable, it had to arise all at once. We know of intelligence being able to project, plan and make such a motor-like system based on lots of information , and it could not have emerged through evolution ( even less so because evolution depends on dna replication being in place ) we can infer rationally design as the best explanation. Chance is no reasonable option to explain the origin of DNA replication since the individual parts would have no function by their own, and there is no reason why matter aleatory-like would group itself in such highly organized and complex machine-like system.",44,1448878090,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3uu2on/dna_replication_and_its_mind_boggling_nano/

According to creationists only organisms of the same 'kind' can breed with each other.

This means that the plants the Senecio vulgaris and Senecio squalidus must be of the same 'kind' since in 1979
it was discovered that they could interbreed and produce a hybrid.  

Now the hybrid generated by this inter-breeding was given the name Senecio eboracensis. This new plant can breed with itself which means it is a viable hybrid. However, and this is the really important part, it cannot breed with either of its parent plants or any other plants.  So this means, according to creationist logic, that the new hybrid must be of a different 'kind'.

So what we have is two plants of one 'kind' interbreeding to create a new never before seen 'kind'. 

A new 'kind' has evolved as a result of hybridization within an existing 'kind'. Which of course is macro evolution.

Needless to say as these are plants you can of course repeat this on your own kitchen table as often as you want. You know repeatable testable evidence of macro evolution, the evolution of a new 'kind'.

According to  Intelligent Design proponents Behe[1], Meyer[2], et all random mutation in DNA sequences do in fact occur. However, these random mutations are always either benign or detrimental to the organism.  This is because the probability of a beneficial mutation, as demonstrated by Behe, Meyer, et al is so infinitesimally small that it can only occur with the intervention of an Intelligent Designer.  An Intelligent Designer that is of course capable of suspending the laws of physics in regards to Brownian motion and those of chemistry in regards to automatic nature of chemical bonding so as to manipulate the molecular bonding as it desires.

Of course this means that the favorable mutation that was observed in the E. coli Long-term Experimental Evolution Project[3] must have been engineered by an Intelligent Designer.  Demonstrating that Intelligent Design is in fact a continuous on going process. Which is also why it is misinterpreted today as the effects of evolution by random mutation.

Now as part of the E. coli Long-term Experimental  samples of the population were frozen at at set intervals during the experiment and continue to be archived today.   This means that the evolution of the population can be initiated and studied from any point in the time line where a frozen sample exists. What we see when we do this is the favorable mutation always happens within the same generational period.

So, because the mutation is beneficial and not benign or disadvantageous, the Intelligent Designer must have playing a part. Which of course means that we now have the ability to make the Intelligent Designer function at times of our own choosing by starting the experiment from any point prior to the occurrence of the favorable mutation. 

Therefore we, mere mortals, can now make the Intelligent Designer, dance.

I don't think so.,"I posted this in /r/DebateAnAtheist a while ago, but the responses there weren't particularly good, I thought. I hope we might have a cordial exchange on this topic on this sub. I do have a lot of work coming up over the next week or so, so responses may be slow.

Why don't I believe that intelligent design is fairly categorised as a type of creationism?

Well, I think we can distinguish between two different questions:

1. The modern intelligent design movement has roots in, and currently overlaps with creationist circles.

2. One can conceptually distinguish design inferences from the supernatural.

---------------


As I see it, these two questions are too often run together as if they are the same, but they really are quite separate. 

I think there is good evidence for 1.

But I also think that 2. is true.

Why? In our daily life, we make inferences to design all the time, but we don't necessarily postulate a supernatural designer.

--------------------

An objection:

""What about the mechanism though? Doesn't ID necessarily postulate miracles? And isn't that creationism?""

I don't think this is true, and here's Mike Behe to tell us why.

Prelude: when I previously posted this, it seems that many people have saw the words ""fine-tuning"" and then thought ""Aha! He's defending the fine-tuning argument in his post"". I'm not: please notice how the long passage by Behe I quote is in the context ""What about the mechanism though? Doesn't ID necessarily postulate miracles"" **NOT** ""Here's why I think we can make a design inference from the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the universe.""

Behe: *“Suppose the laboratory of Pope Mary’s physicist is next to a huge warehouse in which is stored a colossal number of little shiny spheres. Each sphere encloses the complete history of a separate, self-contained, possible universe, waiting to be activated. (In other words, the warehouse can be considered a vast multiverse of possible universes, but none of them have yet been made real.) One enormous section of the warehouse contains all the universes that, if activated, would fail to produce life. They would develop into universes consisting of just one big black hole, universes without stars, universes without atoms, or other abysmal failures. In a small wing of the huge warehouse are stored possible universes that have the right general laws and constants of nature for life. Almost all of them, however, fall into the category of “close, but no cigar.”*

*For example, in one possible universe the Mars-sized body would hit the nascent earth at the wrong angle and life would never commence. In one small room of the small wing are those universes that would develop life. Almost all of the, however, would not develop intelligent life. In one small closet of the small room of the small wing are placed possible universes that would actually develop intelligent life. One afternoon the überphysicist walks from his lab to the warehouse, passes by the huge collection of possible dead universes, strolls into the small wing, over to the small room, opens the small closet, and selects one of the extremely rare universes that is set up to lead to intelligent life. Then he “adds water” to activate it. In that case the now-active universe is fine-tuned to the very great degree of detail required, yet it is activated in a “single creative act”.*

*...There are myriad Powerball-winning events, but they aren’t due to chance. They were foreseen, and chosen from all the possible universes.”*

The Edge of Evolution, 231-232

So, given that finely-tuned events would warrant an inference to design, but involve an unbroken sequence of secondary causation, the objection fails.

----------------------

Some other objections:

""Haven't you ever read Ken Miller/Nick Matzke/Carroll/Coyne's critique of Behe? He/they show(s) how irreducible complexity fails?""

Yes I have. These critiques, if successful, refute ID arguments, but don't refute 2, and that's what I'd like to discuss in this post.

""Haven't you ever read the Wedge Document?""

Yes I have. This document serves as evidence for proposition 1., not against 2.

""Don't you know that even a Republican Christian judge ruled against ID?""

Yes, I am aware. This doesn't refute 2.

""Don't you know that there was a draft of a text book in which the words ""cdesign proponentsists"" occured?""

Yes, I am aware. This doesn't refute 2.

DebateEvolution,3l5bud,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,A bird called Archaeopteryx,"We leave cladistics to experts. And IF we criticize it, we base in on a minimal understanding and knowledge of the subject. To achieve this, one has to go through at least the essentials of the subject. That is the LEAST we might expect for decent and sound debate. But creationists know nothing about anatomy, taxonomy and cladistics. That does not seem to hinder them making gross conclusions about the classification of fossil species and their import for evolution theory.

Let's take Archaeopteryx. Archaeopteryx is classified by modern evolutionary biology as a bird (class Aves). 
The interesting part here is that A. had distinct reptilian traits, NOT FOUND in extant birds, which are:

-	long, bony tail but no pygostyle like birds

-	teeth, similar to those of small, meat-eating dinosaurs (not all teeth in all species look the same) –	birds do not have teeth

-	it had no bill but a beak with teeth

-	neck attached to skull from the rear

-	ribs without joints or uncinate processes, and not articulated with the sternum

-	sacrum that occupies six vertebrae

-	metacarpals free, wrist hand joint flexible

-	claws on three unfused digits

-	pelvic girdle and femur joint shaped like those of archosaurs in many details

-	bones of pelvis unfused

-	etc. in total some 100 (count: HUNDRED) differences from birds but similar to reptilian traits.

But, as far as the palaeontological experts can tell, it most likely was able to fly.

And we have now a bunch of other species and specimen found which clearly show a gradual loss of those reptilian traits and also many that on the other hand are even more reptilian like than A. 
Archaeopteryx is just one of those and even sitting on a side branch.

This is how cladistics works.

The REAL question here is: WHAT is Archaeopteryx as a bird doing with all these distinct REPTILIAN TRAITS in the first place?

While science has progressed and we now know of many transitional species with painstakingly detailed, empirical work done on it, creationists are still moroning around with Archaeopteryx insisting on the bird status of the species. As if palaeontologists (AKA ""evolutionists"") didn't know - it were THEY who provided that information in the first place. Most palaeontologists consider A. to be a bird and have done so for decades by now. Parrot circuits – not interrupted by fresh input from empirical research and the parrots not being schooled to even the slightest level of scientific knowledge – can go on for decades.

Moreover, as I explained in my other post on the no longer missing links (https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3l2ef0/missing_links_not_missing_anymore), the exact taxonomic status of A. as a bird or a reptile is entirely IRRELEVANT. The only things, evolutionary spoken, relevant here are those many reptilian traits exhibited in what after all appears to be a (early) bird. If, on the other hand, it were found to be unable to fly, one could say we've got a dinosaur here. In that case the question still would be then: what the heck is a dinosaur doing with all kinds of distinct bird traits? There is no going around *transitional* specimen. They ARE transitional. As said in that post, evolution is about the transition of traits, not about the taxonomic classification.

When, after all, A. should be considered to be a bird, what the heck is it doing then with all those distinct reptilian traits - THAT is the question to be asked. Or, even more profoundly: BECAUSE of A. being a bird, its reptilian traits are a HALLMARK of evolution. Yet again, in their utter ignorance, creationists are ACTUALLY making a point for evolution theory.

Now google the Ferguson 2005 findings on chicken embryos developing teeth.
From this study we now know that chickens have the full genetic blueprint for growing teeth. In chickens these genes lay dormant, their expression is shut off by past mutations. Ferguson managed to bring those genes to expression again. Apart from its possible practical use (regrowth of lost limbs), the question here is: WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE do birds like hens still have the full genetic blueprint for growing teeth?

We all know of the power of DNA to identify family relationships. If siblings lost family and meet them later again and want to be sure whether they are family, DNA can prove for that 99,9999% validly and decisively. DNA is even able to determine to a certain degree whether an unknown culprit in a crime case would be of any descent (Hispanic, Caucasian, Chinese etc.) by analyzing his or her DNA left on the crime scene. 

But DNA is also useful to establish phylogenetic relationships (the “family” links between species). Guess what species we found genetically closest to birds (in this case they took a chicken)? Yes, crocodiles. And crocodiles are reptiles, like dinosaurs.

And guess what we find if we compare the remnants of collagen found in a Tyrannosaur specimen (the famous Mary Schweitzer research)? Yes, it matches of extant species living today the chicken’s most. Even closer than crocodiles (as predicted as well by evolution). Hence we know that birds evolved from reptiles. But we even know more precisely that they evolved from theropoda lineages (bipedal saurischian dinosaurs, among those Tyrannosaur) and not crocodiles (who establish an complete own superorder within the class of reptiles alongside dinosaurs). Gee, why does this match the earlier paleontological (fossil) findings so perfectly?

Only posts with *substantial arguments* based on *empirical research* (either by experiment or field observations according to established, scientific standards) and clear *explicit referring to traceable scientific sources* will be answered. The others will be discarded without further ado.

DebateEvolution,3l2ef0,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Missing links - not missing anymore.,"It's funny how creationists try to deal with the clear evidence of transitional fossils. Either they put it off by saying such fossils are a hoax or they start a mostly embarrassing layman treatise on the morphological and anatomical implications. Or they classify the fossil to be either the ancestral lineage or the descendant one.

We don't need to go into their layman treatises. It's too embarrassing to even read. Laymen tattling about highly specialized stuff which requires years of hard training are as shameful as the notorious smoker who starts elaborate medical treatises in order to call into question the hazardous effects of smoking on health.

Evolutionary hoaxes are based upon lying about the real import of some disputable cases in the biological literature or just exploiting the very rare real fraud. It never deals with the often dozens or even hundreds up to thousands of other specimen. Putting off 100 specimen because of one fraud is just too ridiculous to even take into serious consideration. It also flagrantly and poignantly contrasts the hundreds of hoaxes and frauds made by creationists. Like the Creationist's museum where little children are depicted riding saddled dinosaurs, as if you are stuck in a Fred Flintstones episode. 

The third argument is actually the funniest one. It is always most endearing to behold creationists being stuck in the noble act of taxonomy.

Now classifying fossils is a highly specialized trade which always requires years of training. Not particularly to be left to untrained laymen all creationists are. 

Also professional taxonomists often have great difficulty in classifying fossils though.

When the first specimen of Homo erectus was found by the Dutch explorer and palaeoanthropologist Eugène Dubois, he coined it ""Java man"". It started a decades long dispute within palaeontology how to classify this find. Was it a hominid? Or more likely an ape (""pithicus"")? Or a human who suffered of some deforming anomaly?

The last argument, was it some kind of maybe genetic anomaly, can be discarded very easily. First of all in the meantime we found dozens of new Homo erectus specimens. Fossil finds are extremely rare. The odds that DOZENS of such rather rare specimens ALL happen to originate from unfortunate individuals who suffered some malformation, can be statistically ruled out - especially when we know how rare those genetic conditions themselves are.

Secondly, the particular traits of Homo erectus specimen do anatomically not resemble the typical features you might find in genetic anomalies among humans. If anyone here knows of a creationist treatise where such morphological analysis is done, let me know. When it comes to specialized research, the Great Dodging inevitably starts.

Thirdly, the cranial “deformities” go along with a series of other typical anatomical treats shared by Homo erectus specimens. Relative to modern humans it had a rather protruding muzzle, small brains (an average of 900 cc over all specimens, although it stood as high as extant humans), smaller cervical and lumbar swellings, hardly any protruding nose, longer vertebral spines, an elongated femoral neck, etc. All these anatomical traits put together rule out any genetic malformation.

Dubois' classification of Java man as a transitional fossil between apes and humans was not selling hot cakes among his then colleagues. 

Apparently it's hard to classify transitional fossils adequately altogether. The reason is the transitional character itself. It is the nature of transitional fossils to be classified within taxonomy only with the greatest difficulty.

Let's have Homo erectus again. Basically, if we leave all kinds of minor details away, Erectus was a hominid which was very human-like from the neck down but differed considerably “upstairs”. Now what is it? After decades of quarrel, taxonomists decided it was a hominid. And not an “ape”. There are good reasons for it. We meanwhile found that Homo erectus was fabricating tools. And there’s good evidence that it also used fire.

Nice for the taxonomists. IRRELEVANT for evolution theory. The taxonomic categorization and classification of fossil specimens into some taxon, genus or species is their own business of taxonomists. Whether Erectus was to be named Pithecus erectus or Homo erectus is only *informative* for evolutionists. THEIR argument is about unearthed specimens exhibiting varying mixes of traits that are BOTH typical to ancestral predecessor AND to the descendant life forms. The fossil evidence for evolution is about transitioning TRAITS. It is NOT about taxonomy.

And the more difficult the taxonomic classification of some fossil find turns out to be, THE BETTER for evolution. Because evolution theory PREDICTS transitional fossils that are hard to classify. By their very transitional nature.

So the hilarious scene of creationists desperately classifying fossils, unhindered by any sound technical knowledge and understanding of anatomy – thus making gross errors and distortions underway – then nevertheless jumping to an IRRELEVANT conclusion about the exact classification, is always funny to behold.

But it becomes even more funny when creationists are mocking about the apparent inability of taxonomists to classify specimen properly. “See, the evolutionists cannot even make up their own mind whether this is a hominid or an ape”. 

They think they made an important point.

But in their utter ignorance and muddleheadiness, they just made an point pro evolution.

This is how stupidity looks like.

DebateEvolution,3kz1rm,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,The quote mine index number,"In statistics we measure phenomena often by means of index numbers.
Biologist Richard Dawkins introduced an interesting one, the quote mining index as an indicator for creationist's dishonesty.

He let Google count the number of quote hits of one of the things he said in one of his books. Then he let Google count the number of a very next sentence in the very same phrase of that book, the one that brings the misquotation back into its correct context. He retrieved a ratio of 6 to 1.

Let's do that again with one of the most quote mined sentences in the work of Darwin: the eye.

The quote is: ""To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree"".

Creationists LOVE that phrase. Hence they quote it as if their life depended upon it. The number of Google hits counts 8,940.

In the FIRST LINE of the paragraph that immediately follows that quote, we find the sentence ""Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, ..."". The number of Google hits for that quote is 2,650.

The rate is 8,940 / 2,650 = 3.4.
That's a fair rate of creationist's dishonesty.
Because I am very merciful. A quick check of the first 3 pages of both Google score lists, reveals that most of those 8,940 hits are of creationist's sources, while most of the 2,650 list is by scientists and others, trying to correct the quote mine.

DebateEvolution,3kne63,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution of land animals,"Tiktaalik is a transitional fossil. It is a link between fish and amphibians. The mixture of both fish and tetrapod characteristics found in Tiktaalik include: 

Fish traits: 

- gills 

- scales 

- fins 

""Fishapod"" traits: 

- tetrapod limb bones and joints, including a functional wrist joint and radiating, but fish-like fins instead of toes 

- half-fish, half-tetrapod ear region. 

Tetrapod traits: 

- rib bones 

- mobile neck with separate pectoral girdle 

- lungs.

And that's only a concise summary of all traits examined.

The evolutionary preceding lob-finned fish already had bony skeletons and were using BOTH lungs and gills. Lungs developed out of the swim bladder, which many fish of those times had - but the lobe-finned of course was lacking. 

On the other evolutionary side of Tiktaalik we have further more species with even more tetrapod developments. And everything in between all those, like Eusthenopteron, Gogonasus, Panderichthys, Ichthyostega, Acanthostega, Hynerpeton, Tulerpeton, Eryops. Etc. All to be found on wiki ""tetrapods"". The fossil record of the fish - tatrapod evolution is becoming rather crowded lately.

So it's not even an exhausting list. All these species show a morphologically and chronologically perfect development from fish to tetrapods.

DebateEvolution,3kj9o2,Denisova,,t2_qaxbc,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution of cetaceans,"Let's talk a bit about the whales, dolphins and their direct relatives, the cetaceans.

First: we found fossils of a marine animal Dorudon. Without doubt is was a fully aquatic animal. It resembles modern cetaceans to a high degree. It only had one very particular trait: HIND LIMBS. Clearly visible, complete with all anatomic features defining hind limbs in vertebrae. Those hind limbs were attached to a pelvis, also still in place but in a very atavistic fashion. And here is the interesting part: the pelvis was completely DETACHED from the spine. Clearly it could not walk with those. Especially because of their size: hardly larger than modern housecat’s ones. A bit too tiny for a 5-6 metres long animal that approximately weighted some 600 kilo’s.
Now, tell me, what is a MARINE animal doing with a dysfunctional pelvis and hind limbs in the first place? 

But Dorudon isn’t the only one we found.

We found at least 7 other species with a varying mix of both a land animal and cetacean features. Moreover, these species clearly show gradual transition from land animal to cetacean in all relevant features (nostril, limbs, tail, pelvis etc.). This transition follows a concordant chronological order, proven by dating.

Extant cetaceans show closer genetic, biochemical and organic relationship to land animals than to marine life. The DNA of cetaceans most resembles that of hippopotamus, a (not surprisingly!) semi aquatic LAND DWELLING animal, and NOT that of other marine life. Cetaceans breathe with lungs and not gills. They possess brains with the very distinct features only mammals have. Apart from the lost hind limbs and pelvis, their skeleton resembles those of land animals, not that of marine life, both in morphology and the bony tissue make-up. They are mammals, giving life birth to their young and milk feed them. They are warm-blooded. 

99% of all mammals species live on land. Moreover, the earlier mammals before any cetacean was around in the fossil record, all were land dwelling animals.

But there is more. Many cetaceans are born with vestigial pelvises and hind limbs, sometimes with remnants of the digits complete. Furthermore, ALL cetaceans develop hind limbs in the first weeks of their embryonic development, these eventually being dissolved in a later fetal stage. The same applies to fur. Cetacean embryos also develop fur, in a later stage of gestation to be shed.

The reason for this is that ALL cetaceans have found to possess the almost complete genetic make-up for developing hind limbs and pelvises. Otherwise it would have been impossible to produce embryonic atavisms or vestiges in the first place – such structures can only develop by gene expression. Hence the mere existence of vestiges and atavisms are the evidence as such for underlying genes. And the genes to produce such rather complex structures are inevitably complex themselves. So it is virtually impossible for these gene complexes to be formed in one instance in some animal, let alone that atavisms occur in every cetacean embryo. 

What actually happened is that some so called Hox-genes (regulatory genes) were “shut off” by mutations. How this works and has been observed, can be read here: pnas.org/content/103/22/84144.full. The geneticists even found WHICH hox genes exactly were involved. And why cetacean embryos still start to develop hind limbs in early embryonic development. Because the genetic relay race kind of gene expression still functions in its initial stage - the mutations in the Hox genes affect later stages. Or how some cetaceans develop almost intact, atavistic hind limbs. Or how some whales still have vestigial pelvises.

Now here some questions:
- what were ancient MARINE animals like Dorudon doing with detached and thus dysfunctional hind limbs and pelvises in the first place?
- why is the fossil record showing such a perfect evolution from a land ungulate to marine animals?
- why are modern cetaceans genetically closest to land animals and not to any other sea life? 
- why are cetaceans mammals while all other mammals are basically LAND DWELLING animals?
- why were the first distinguishable mammals showing up in the fossil record exclusively land dwellers?
- why do cetaceans develop vestigial hind limbs and pelvises on a very regular basis?
- why do cetaceans develop hind limbs (and fur!) in early embryonic development and why are these aborted in later stages of gesticulation?
- why have all cetaceans the almost complete genetic make-up for hind limbs, found in land animals? There has NEVER been found ANY fish with such a genetic blueprint.

https://answersingenesis.org/biology/microbiology/information-processing-differences-between-bacteria-and-eukarya/


&gt;
The leading strand of DNA is synthesized continuously, while the antiparallel lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously, as Okazaki fragments, because nucleotides are always added in a 5′ to 3′ direction in the cell. The RNA primers will be removed and exchanged with DNA by gap filling and the Okazaki fragments will be joined by DNA ligase. During the termination stage, terminators (in bacteria), or chromosomal ends called telomeres (in eukarya), will be synthesized. As detailed below, bacteria and eukarya differ in their requirements for DNA replication initiation and termination in both their DNA sequences (cis-elements) and in their trans-elements, i.e. the proteins that execute and regulate DNA replication (Forterre 2013; Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999; Makarova and Koonin 2013; Merhej and Raoult 2012; O’Donnell, Langston, Stillman 2013; Skarstad and Katayama 2013).

&gt;A.1 Differences in the initiation site of replication

&gt;The first step of DNA replication is the recognition of start sites at the origins of replication by origin-binding proteins. Strikingly, the origins of DNA replication are species specific. Duplicating DNA in E. coli requires an E. coli-specific origin of replication, while duplication in S. cerevisiae requires an S. cerevisiae-specific origin of replication. These origins of replication are not interchangeable. This fact is experimentally demonstrated on a daily basis in many laboratories throughout the world: to clone and replicate an S. cerevisiae gene in E. coli requires a vector with an E. coli origin of replication, and to clone and replicate a bacterial gene in S. cerevisiae requires a vector carrying an S. cerevisiae origin of replication (plus a yeast centromere).

&gt;Bacteria and eukarya also differ in the numbers of origins of replication. Bacteria typically have a single circular chromosome with a single origin of replication, while eukarya have hundreds or thousands of origins of replication spread across multiple linear chromosomes. So how could evolution accomplish the change from one circular DNA strand to multiple linear chromosomes (for example, 16 pairs = 32 in yeast)? The bacterium might begin by evolving an enzyme to chop up its DNA into 16 pieces. But since it would have only one origin of replication, only 1/16th of the DNA would be replicated and the cell would die. It would have to simultaneously generate new origins of replication for all 16 pieces.

DebateEvolution,3juajm,mikoc5,,t2_imjcn,self.DebateEvolution,,Mik Ogniokrwisty's comparison of Creationistic and Evolutionary world origin theories,"(The following is a script I've written out for a Youtube video. I am too f*ing lazy to record it all though ._.)
Hello there I am Mik Ogniokrwisty and I do not believe in... wait for it...
fairies.
Whatever I do or don’t believe in God is irrelevant because he’s God, he can do whatever the fuck he wants. And supposedly God wanted to create the Earth out of nothing, spawn in 2 people and allow it to develop into 7 billion or whatever the earth’s population is at the time of you watching this video. Also supposedly there is no God and we all evolved from a single cell that eventually became 7 billion people and all the whole collective fauna and flora of the entire bloody planet.
So let’s compare these two and see if either one is as stupid as the other. Now, let’s split the screen into 2 parts and assume those 2 halves are both their own universes. In the top universe, the Adam and Eve are true and in the bottom one, the evolution is true.

So we know how it started and how it ended but what about the middle?
Adam and eve would have had to had a lot of children that then spread across the globe. They most likely can’t swim for thousands of miles so either a) the continents were all connected or b) the water dividing them was very limited. Then their skin colour changed in places, and they had a whole lotta more incestous sex to create babies that created more babies, and eventually these babies took over the planet over the course of several thousand years.

And if Evolution happened, we started off with one cell that started rapidly multiplying, reaching triple or more digits before starting to branch out. Some of these cells ended up in hot water and had to develop heat resistance, some ended up somewhere closer to the Titanic’s favourite vacation spot and had to wear some fur coats. But because there weren't any available, they just grew thicker skin. Some of them decided it would be a good idea to work together - division of labor and resources helped and they could be more versatile. This grew to become three, fourty, five hundred, six sixty six, seven thousand and so forth cells working together until one day we suddenly had things crawling out of the water and re-enacting the scene from Spore where your species migrates from water onto land. These things started to grow bigger and smarter until one day we ended up having having talking monkeys that then turned into the bipedal planet-wide earth-rapers that we are today over the course of several milion years. Captain Planet is not happy about the earth-raping.

So in scenario one we have a very small starting number of specimen rapidly increasing in numbers within a pre-made environment that could be altered at will, spreading across the planet, changing depending on where they are, and becoming the dominant species despite the scenario creator’s nuking the whole project at least once, setting it up for failure and punishing the subjects for it, supposedly letting it run on its own but constantly interfering and changing the parameters.
In scenario two we have a very small starting number of specimen steadily increasing in numbers in a constantly but slowly changing environment that had nothing interfering in it, spreading acorss the planet, changing depending on where they are and what they did, and becoming the dominant species. And well, every damn species.

Are there problems with these scenarios? Yes. There are, I count four of them. *wheatly looks at the counter suspiciously*
The first problem is that I had to simplify the squares and circles out of this for the sake of comparison and to make the explanation fairly simple. There’s a lot more to both of these and I may look into them in the future.
Second problem is that neither of these was ever observed. Actually, that’s not exactly true. We did observe evolution in laboratorial conditions. We haven’t seen the first cell, mostly because... How the fuck were we supposed to, humanity didn’t even exist - nothing even had legs back then. For all we know, the first cell could have been eaten by the second cell, melted alive and farted out as an empty husk while the second cell stole all the glory. On the other hand, we never saw Adam and Eve either! There’s no witness accounts recorded on audio, video, or even paper. Back when they supposedly were alive, there was no way to write it all down, and the only source wa have for it is a book that, for all we know, might be just a book that ate another book, shat out the cover, rearranged the letters and presented itself as the one and only.

Third problem is that we know that Adam and Eve could never have made enough children to even start a human population anywhere due to problems inbreeding would cause - there’s a reason why you’re not allowed to have intercourse with your mother or sister. One it’s considered freaking disgusting and two, it’s got almost no chance, if any, to produce a healthy offspring and the one family that would’ve started it all would’ve died.
There’s a counterargument to this problem that states that incest wasn’t a problem back then, and it fits in with the scenario where the population underwent changes. Fair enough.
Fourth problem, this time with the evolutionary theory, is that we don’t have a complete fossil record so we can’t be sure this model is true. ...So? Hey look, that water we thought was cold an hour ago is now boiling. It MUST have suddenly spiked from 20 to 100 degrees. There’s NO WAY anyone checked its temeprature 10 minutes ago. What? We have a picture that shows it was 70 degrees 3 minutes ago? And another one from 10 minutes ago that it was 50? No, that’s not enough evidence that it slowly heated up. I won’t believe it unless someone records the whole damn thing start to finish! Hashtag sarcasm. *show pictures of hashish, a price tag, the SAR-21 rifle and a chasm with each syllable*


So... which do we believe? The one where Adam and Eve started it all, or the one where we come from apes and single-cell organisms? Do we trust gut instinct? A book? Or some theories that one man issues way back in the day?

That’s the fifth problem: I did the whole thing wrong. What we should do is not assume something was true and then fit the evidence into it, but look at the evidence we have and, IF we have theories, see which one it supports best or make a completely new one. So whatever you’re a zealous creationist or evolutionist, whatever you do or do not believe in god, whatever you’re sceptic or gullaible, I implore you.

The four basic categories of molecules for building life are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.  Here we will give a closer look at fatty acids,  constituents of lipids, and their biosynthesis.

Lipids (‘fats’) are essential for the formation of a cell membrane that contains the cell contents, as well as for other cell functions. The cell membrane, comprised of several different complex lipids, is an essential part of a free-living cell that can reproduce itself.

Lipids have much higher energy density than sugars or amino acids, so their formation in any chemical soup is a problem for origin of life scenarios (high energy compounds are thermodynamically much less likely to form than lower energy compounds).  Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains of various lengths. The ability to synthesize a variety of lipids is essential to all organisms.  Fatty acid synthesis requires the oxidation of the co-factor NADPH.

The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway. Due to the complexity of the metabolic pathways, it has been argued that metabolism‐like chemical reaction sequences are unlikely to be catalysed by simple environmental catalysts.


This constitutes a serious problem for naturalistic explanations of the origin of life. The pentose phosphate pathway requires 7 enzymes, and is interdependent with glycolysis , since the beginning molecule for the pentose phosphate pathway is glucose-6-P, which is the second intermediate metabolite in glycolysis. 

Eukaryotic cells face a dilemma in providing suitable amounts of substrate for fatty acid synthesis. Sufficient quantities of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH must be generated in the cytosol for fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA is made by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, so the problem reduces to generating sufficient acetyl-CoA and NADPH. There are three principal sources of acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA derived from amino acid degradation is normally insufficient for fatty acid biosynthesis, and the acetyl-CoA produced by pyruvate dehydrogenase and by fatty acid oxidation cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane to participate directly in fatty acid synthesis. Instead, acetyl-CoA is linked  with  oxaloacetate to form citrate, which is transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol by  citrate carriers (CIC),  nuclear-encoded proteins located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, members of the mitochondrial carrier family.  Biosynthesis of oxaloacetate requires  malate dehydrogenase enzymes or, in plants, pyruvate carboxylase enzymes.

So all these listed functional units and substrates are required in the synthesis process. They are essential, constituting a interdependent interlocked system of the cell.

As Bruce Alberts said in 1998, the biology of the future was going to be the study of molecular machines: “the entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines.”  One of those machines is like a mini-factory in itself. It’s called fatty acid synthase.

The first step of fatty acid biosynthesis requires the participation of  malonyl-CoA, a three-carbon intermediate.  The formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA is an irreversible process, catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes. a multifunctional protein with 3 subunits, which is carefully regulated.

In the second step, fatty acid synthase ( FAS) proteins come into action. These are the little heroes of this article. FAS most striking feature is the “high degree of architectural complexity” – some 48 active sites, complete with moving parts

Which organism has one of the most elaborate fatty-acid machines of all?  The surprising answer: fungi. 
Perhaps the most striking feature of fungal FAS is its high degree of architectural complexity, in which 48 functional centers exist in a single ... particle.  Detailed structural information is essential for delineating how this complex particle coordinates the reactions involved in many steps of synthesis of fatty acids.... The six alpha subunits form a central wheel in the assembly, and the beta subunits form domes on the top and bottom of the wheel, creating six reaction chambers within which each Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) can reach the six active sites through surprisingly modest movements.

The crystal structure of yeast FAS reveals that this large, macromolecular assembly functions as a six-chambered reactor for fatty acid synthesis.  Each of the six chambers functions independently and has in its chamber wall all of the catalytic units required for fatty acid priming, elongation, and termination, while one substrate-shuttling component, ACP, is located inside each chamber and functions like a swinging arm.  Surprisingly, however, the step at which the reactor is activated must occur before the complete assembly of the particle since the PPT domain that attaches the pantetheine arm to ACP lies outside the assembly,inaccessible to ACP that lies inside.  Remarkably, the architectural complexity of the FAS particle results in the simplicity of the reaction mechanisms for fatty acid synthesis in fungi.

To imagine this level of precision and master-controlled processing on a level this small, cannot help but induce a profound sense of wonder and awe.  Here, all this time, this machine has been helping to keep living things functioning and we didn’t even know the details till now. 

The fatty acids are useless without the amino acids, and vice versa .  Even if some kind of metabolic cycle were to be envisioned under semi-realistic conditions, how did this elaborate machine, composed of amino acids with precise charge distributions, arise?  It’s not just the machine, it’s the blueprints and construction process that must be explained.  What blind process led to the precise placement of active sites that process their inputs in a programmed sequence?  What put them into a structure with shared walls where six reaction chambers can work independently?  All this complexity, involving thousands of precision amino acids in FAS  has to be coded in DNA, then built by the formidably complex translation process, then assembled together in the right order, or FAS won’t work.  But the storage, retrieval, translation and construction systems all need the fatty acids, too, or they won’t work.

We are witnessing an interdependent system of mind-boggling complexity that defies any explanation besides intelligent design.  Yes, Bruce Alberts, “as it turns out, we can walk and we can talk because the chemistry that makes life possible is much more elaborate and sophisticated than anything we students had ever considered.”  We have tended to “vastly underestimate the sophistication of many of these remarkable devices.”

The closer they look, the more wondrous the cell gets.  Who would have thought that the requirement to make these fatty acids would require machinery with moving parts and reaction chambers?  Who would have imagined their surfaces would be covered with complex proteins that regulate the production inside?  Who would have realized that fat was so important, the cell had complex assembly plants to build it?  Fat is almost a mild cussword in our vocabulary, but it is another class of molecular building blocks we couldn’t live without.  Fats, sugars, proteins and nucleic acids all work together in life, from humans to lowly fungi.  Each class of molecules has immense variety, each is essential, and each is manufactured to spec by precision machinery.  What a wonderful post-Darwinian world.

How do origin of life researchers envision the arise of these hyper complex nano factories and assembly lines to make fatty acids ? The scientific paper The lipid world says :

Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules into complex supramolecular structures is spontaneous. The plausibility that such structures were present in the prebiotic environment is supported by the occurrence of amphiphilic molecules in carbonaceous meteorites and the demonstration that they can assemble into membrane vesicles. 

This paper shows the helplessness of proponents of  natural prebiotic origin of lipids. Its a hudge gap between above explanation, and the arise of hypercomplex multyenzymatic proteins, which produce fatty acids through advanced, regulated, precise, coordinated multistep factory assembly-line like robotic  procedures. 

I conclude that the make of  essential fatty acids, ingredients of cell membranes, requires interdependent irreducible complex procedures,  several different metabolic pathways in order to make the substrates and produce the energy used in the process, several enzymes, the whole machinery to make the assembly proteins and enzymes. Since this constitutes a complex interlocked process, it could not be due to step by step evolutionary manner. Fatty acids, constituents of the cell membranes, had to exist right from the start for life to arise. This fact makes the design inference the most rational one.

This claim seems to have originated from a [paper published](http://www.donotlink.com/gcsl) in 2011 by young earth creationist [Jeffrey Thomkins](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Tomkins). It was published in a non-peer reviewed creationist journal.

The original lab sequences can be obtained from the NCBI trace archive database - [here is a link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=species_code%3D%22PAN%20TROGLODYTES%22&amp;dopt=fasta&amp;size=47918250&amp;dispmax=5&amp;page=1&amp;seeas=Show) to a search returning the sequences obtained directly from Chimpanzees.

In this post, I hope to put Jeffrey Thomkins' claims and the claims of /u/stcordova to the test.

First of all a word of caution about trace data taken directly from the labs:

1. There are graphs called chromatograms that go along with any given trace. These tell you how clean and reliable the data is for each base in that trace. [Here is a brief tutorial](http://seqcore.brcf.med.umich.edu/doc/dnaseq/interpret.html) on reading these. If the data for a given base is good, you should expect clean and evenly spaced peaks with a minimal amount of baseline noise. The chromatograms are available for all traces in the NCBI database. You will notice when looking at any chromatogram that they are messy and noisy at either end of the sequence but the peaks are clean and sharp near the middle. [Here is an example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=355302900&amp;dopt=trace&amp;color=on&amp;size=1&amp;seeas=Show) (scroll to the far left to see the results of 'dye blobs' affecting the read and scroll far to the right to see how the peaks weaken and become harder to see but take note how the data is clean and easy read in the center of the trace)

2. Apart from the first issue, there are also predictable errors that occur near the beginning and again at the end of any sequencing run.

Don't just take my word for it - it says so [right here](http://seqcore.brcf.med.umich.edu/doc/dnaseq/interpret.html): ""*Predictable errors occur near the beginning and again at the end of any sequencing run*"". So when joining two or more trace sequences that contain overlapping data, one needs to be aware that they will likely need to discard roughly 50 - 100 bases from both the beginning and the end of the trace which will contain nonsense data. It is easy to verify that this is the case and I will demonstrate this effect using trace sequences from the human genome.

[Here is a human trace](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=7873984&amp;dopt=fasta&amp;size=1&amp;seeas=Show)

Select ""Show as Info"" to verify that it is from a human and try selecting ""Show as quality"" to see it's quality data. Notice how the quality is poor both at the beginning and the end of the trace while in the center it is acceptable.

I will now search for this trace against the consensus human genome. It has [one convincing result](http://jsbin.com/pakaweqali) but note that it only starts matching the consensus sequence (GRCh38) from nucleotide 27 onwards. Now let's [look at the alignment](http://jsbin.com/zeqaxacezo). Notice 1) how the first 27 nucleotides don't match anything (ctgaaattgc gggacagtag ttcatc), 2) Things start getting shakey towards the end of the trace as errors creep into the trace data.

You can repeat this experiment for any of the [275 million human traces](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=species_code%3D%22Homo%20Sapiens%22&amp;size=0&amp;retrieve=Submit) found in the NCBI database and you will find that for the vast majority of them this same effect occurs: 1) Nonsense data at the beginning of the read and often at the end as well 2) We find an increasing amount of noise towards the end of the read.

[Here is another one for example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=40412396&amp;dopt=fasta&amp;size=1&amp;retrieve=Submit): It convincingly [matches 1 location in the human genome with 96.6% identity](http://jsbin.com/cahepezepe) and [here is the alignment](http://jsbin.com/budilurane). Notice once again how there is nonsense at either end of the sequence that doesn't match anything (17 bases at the start and 76 bases at the end) and notice once again how errors tend to be clustered towards the end of the sequence.

It is easy to verify that these bits at the beginning and end of the sequence should be discarded because we can simply use a BLAST search against the NCBI trace database to look for overlapping sequences. As expected when we do this, we find that the overlapping trace reads do not contain this nonsense DNA. I will now illustrate this with some Chimpanzee trace data:

Here is a [Chimpanzee sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;val=355302900&amp;dopt=fasta&amp;size=1&amp;retrieve=Submit). If I run a BLAT search against panTro4, we find [a number of matching results this time](http://jsbin.com/wonowufuso) but almost all of them start matching at position 74 and don't match the last 118 nucleotides beyond position 955. [Here is the alignment](http://jsbin.com/qiyuwixexa) - notice once again the familiar pattern of nonsense at the beginning and end of the trace and a tendency for errors to cluster towards the end. Nevertheless it is 99.4% identical to the consensus Chimp sequence. Looking into why it found so many matches, I find the straight forward explanation: this trace is a piece of the [LINE element L1PA7](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=panTro4&amp;position=chr7%3A125368959-125370286&amp;hgsid=440747312_qoQPlBzqJfXvskYnVLW5W2CASD6M) and this LINE element is scattered in a number of places throughout the Chimpanzee genome.

I will now attempt to show that the first 74 bases are nonsense and have been rightly excluded from the consensus Chimpanzee sequence.

I will run a BLAST search through all 47 million traces in the NCBI database for a sequence that starts just after the first 74 nucleotides

So hopefully /u/stcordova now understands the issues with trace data. In spite of these issues it is still possible to show the the trace data maps well onto the consensus Chimpanzee sequence panTro4 and there is still a good match with the consensus Human sequence (GRCh38)

/u/stcordova if you don't believe me then my challenge to you now it to pick 5 of the 47,918,250 trace sequences - just give me 5 numbers from 1 to 47,918,250 and after making allowance for the nonsense at the beginning and end of trace sequences, I will illustrate that it still has a high similarity 95 - 99% to the Human sequence.

DebateEvolution,3h43ak,stcordova,,t2_79d54,self.DebateEvolution,,Evolution of the Kozak sequence to replace the Shine-Dalgarno sequence,"The story goes eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.  

Associated with the translation of proteins in prokaryotes is the Shine-Dalgarno sequence.

&gt;The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic messenger RNA, generally located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG.[1] The RNA sequence helps recruit the ribosome to the mRNA to initiate protein synthesis by aligning the ribosome with the start codon.

&gt;The Shine-Dalgarno sequence exists both in bacteria and archaea. It is also present in some chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts. The six-base consensus sequence is AGGAGG; in Escherichia coli, for example, the sequence is AGGAGGU, while subsequence GAGG dominates in E. coli virus T4 early genes.[1]

&gt;The Shine-Dalgarno sequence was proposed by Australian scientists John Shine (b. 1946) and Lynn Dalgarno (b. 1935).


Contrast Shine-Dalgrano sequence in prokaryotes with the Kozak consensus sequence in Eukaryotes:

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozak_consensus_sequence

&gt;The Kozak consensus sequence, Kozak consensus or Kozak sequence, is a sequence which occurs on eukaryotic mRNA and has the consensus (gcc)gccRccAUGG. The Kozak consensus sequence plays a major role in the initiation of the translation process.[1] The sequence was named after the person who brought it to prominence, Marilyn Kozak.

If the Shine-Dalgrano was working so good, why did it evolve into the Kozak consensus sequence?  

And it bears pointing out, the Shine-Dalgrano sequence is present in so many translation initiation sites.  One can't just mutate one of them in order to make it a Kozak type sequence, one has to mutate all or most of them.

One can't just cite the fact eukaryotic mitochondira have some Shine-Dalgrano sequences.  Proteins shared between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in the nuclear DNA but with Kozak vs. Shine-Dalgrano sequences need some explanation for macroevolution to be plausible.  


PS
One thing we also know that the Kozak sequence is part of the UTR (untranslated regions) which may actually be translated.  See:

OK, so then it appears evolutionists deny that evolution had a role in certain features of life, especially those critical to basic functioning of life -- features that are pretty important!

Is that because:

A  evolution can't explain origin of life, never will

B  evolution isn't responsible for those features associated with the origin of life

C  just a convenient relabeling 

D  other (explain)

If one says it's just a relabeling, then does this mean evolution can't explain it or does that mean some mechanism other than evolution was involved?  In either case, it's denying evolution had a role in the emergence of such features, or at the very least evolution has no credible answers.

If one says evolution doesn't apply to the origin of life, then that is a denial that evolution had a role in features we associate with the origin of life such as say the evolution of tRNA-synthetases before tRNA-synthetases existed.

This is pretty strong evidence that a planning intelligence is required to set it up.[/b][/color]

A critically important macromolecule—arguably “second in importance only to DNA”—is ATP. As far as known, all organisms from the simplest bacteria to humans use ATP as their primary energy currency. ATP contains the purine base adenine and the sugar ribose which together form the nucleoside adenosine. Adenine is one of the most important organic molecules for life as we know it today. ""Adenine synthesis is perhaps the best example of an irreducibly complex system that can be found in life ..."" the process doesn't work unless all 11 enzymes are present.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2137-atp-the-energy-currency-for-the-cell#3825

Adenine would never accumulate in any kind of ""prebiotic soup.

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2028-origin-of-the-dna-double-helix#3435

In eukaryotes the mitochondria produce most of the cell’s ATP (anaerobic glycolysis also produces some)   The systems most frequently mentioned as irreducible complex, as the flagellum, have about 40 essential proteins.

ATP is only one of hundreds of thousands of essential molecules in eukaryotic cells. That makes the cell a hudge, enormous , unimaginable irreducible, interlocked, interdependent nano factory of incredible complexity.A few essential proteins and molecules are mentioned here :

http://reasonandscience.heavenforum.org/t2085-essential-parts-proteins-enzymes-organelles-and-functions-in-the-cell?highlight=essential

This list is supposed to grow upon further investigation. We know only four basic methods of producing ATP: in bacterial cell walls, in the cytoplasm by photosynthesis, in chloroplasts, and in mitochondria. No transitional forms exist to bridge these four methods by evolution. According to the concept of irreducible complexity, these ATP producing machines must have been manufactured as functioning units and they could not have evolved by Darwinism mechanisms. Anything less than an entire ATP molecule will not function and a manufacturing plant which is less than complete cannot produce a functioning ATP. Some believe that the field of biochemistry which has achieved this understanding has already falsified the Darwinian world view (Behe, 1996).  It certainly looks like the numerous enzymes and carrier proteins needed for cellular respiration demonstrates irreducible complexity. not only does there have to be enough of each of the enzymes and carrier proteins present but they must also work in the right order and be effective enough as well. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and a machine is only as efficient as its slowest part. Given what we know about how life actually works and how easily it dies when it doesn't have enough energy, it is evident that for cellular respiration to have developed naturally within living organisms that could reproduce, would have required several simultaneous innovations. Some scientists have argued that the positions of intelligent design and irreducible complexity are arguments from ignorance which lack enough imagination. I would submit that the concerns put forth above are based, not on ignorance, but on what we actually do know about how life actually works and how easily it dies. Just as a car can die from not having enough gas for energy, or oil for seizing parts, or anti-freeze for engine overheating, so too, all physicians know that there are many different pathways to death. If you really want to begin to understand how life came into existence, you first have to understand how easily it can become non-existent.

The Transport of Proteins into Mitochondria

Mitochondria are double-membrane-enclosed organelles. They specialize in ATP synthesis, using energy derived from electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and from photosynthesis in chloroplasts . Although both organelles contain their own DNA, ribosomes, and other components required for protein synthesis, most of their proteins are encoded in the cell nucleus and imported from the cytosol.

If the endosymbiosis theory were true, would the proteins not keep being encoded and produced all inside mitochondria ? 

Most organelle proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm from nuclear encoded mRNAs. These proteins must be imported into mitochondria. Special sequences, called signal sequences, target the protein to its proper organelle. Organelles contain protein translocator complexes that are required for this transport.

Key players in this process are proteins, a signal sequence, chaperonins, ATP, protein translocator complexes, and signal peptidase.

In order for  proteins required inside of mitochondria being able to arrive at their destination, following is required :

All the machinery to synthesize mRNA's
Cytoplasm and the container of it ( the cell membrane )
the ribosome to make proteins
proteins
signal sequences
chaperonins
ATP,
protein translocator complexes required for the transport
signal peptidase
and the organelle ( the mitochondrion ) into which the protein is transported

if any of it is missing, nothing goes. That is a irreducible , interlocked and interdependent system, which indicates that all the organelles and machinery had to emerge simultaneously. A separate independent stepwise arise is not possible.

Proteins destined for transport into mitochondria contain a signal sequence. This sequence acts as a targeting mechanism to ensure the protein is delivered to the proper organelle.

Most signal-relay stations we know about were intelligently designed. Signal without recognition is meaningless.  Communication implies a signalling convention (a “coming together” or agreement in advance) that a given signal means or represents something: e.g., that S-O-S means “Send Help!”   The transmitter and receiver can be made of non-sentient materials, but the functional purpose of the system always comes from a mind.  The mind uses the material substances to perform an algorithm that is not itself a product of the materials or the blind forces acting on them.  Signal sequences may be composed of mindless matter, but they are marks of a mind behind the intelligent design.

In the mitochondrial electron-transport chain, six different cytochrome hemes, eight iron–sulfur clusters, three copper atoms, a flavin mononucleotide (another electron-transfer cofactor), and ubiquinone work in a defined sequence to carry electrons from NADH to O2. In total, this pathway involves more than 60 different polypeptides arranged in three large membrane protein complexes, each of which binds several of the above electron-carrying cofactors.

It now appears that the we have  trillions of mechanical devices similar like those coupling rods.  They serve to transmit the energy in the food we eat into mechanical energy, driving a proton pump inside the mitochondrion.  It’s all part of an amazing series of electromechanical machines in the powerhouses of the cell. A special type of „transmission element“, which is not known from any other protein, appears to be responsible for the energy transduction within the complex by mechanical nanoscale coupling. Transferred to the technical world, this could be described as a power transmission by a coupling rod, which connects for instance the wheels of a steam train.

Did life really come about solely by random chemicals coming together to form cells, then simple organisms, and then complex ones like us? In other words, without a mind at work to make it happen? Do you think that the over twenty different enzymes and carrier proteins, each consisting of over 300 amino acids, just happened to come together in a specific pathway, called cellular respiration, to provide our cells with the energy they need to live? No, when it comes to the origin of life it seems to me that Science still has a lot of explaining to do. Meanwhile, as we wait for evolutionary biologists to admit the deficiencies within their theory, our children and the whole world continue to be misled!

DebateEvolution,3g9atz,stcordova,,t2_79d54,self.DebateEvolution,,Levinthal Paradox of Protein Interactome vs. Evolutionism,"Here is the paper on the Levinthal Pardox in the Interactome:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302650/

&gt;The central biological question of the 21st century is: how does a viable cell emerge from the bewildering combinatorial complexity of its molecular components? Here, we estimate the combinatorics of self-assembling the protein constituents of a yeast cell, a number so vast that the functional interactome could only have emerged by iterative hierarchic assembly of its component sub-assemblies. A protein can undergo both reversible denaturation and hierarchic self-assembly spontaneously, but a functioning interactome must expend energy to achieve viability. Consequently, it is implausible that a completely “denatured” cell could be reversibly renatured spontaneously, like a protein. Instead, new cells are generated by the division of pre-existing cells, an unbroken chain of renewal tracking back through contingent conditions and evolving responses to the origin of life on the prebiotic earth. We surmise that this non-deterministic temporal continuum could not be reconstructed de novo under present conditions.
...
&gt;perhaps the most profound conclusion to be drawn from our calculations of combinatorial complexity is that the emergent interactome could not have self-organized spontaneously from its isolated protein components. Rather, it attains its functional state by templating the interactome of a mother cell and maintains that state by a continuous expenditure of energy. In the absence of a prior framework of existing interactions, it is far more likely that combined cellular constituents would end up in a non-functional, aggregated state, one incompatible with life. Even the recent successful creation of an artificial bacterial cell36 only demonstrates that synthetic genetic material can be transplanted into the cytoplasm (i.e., the viable interactome) of a very closely related bacterium. The spontaneous origination of a de novo cell has yet to be observed; all extant cells are generated by the division of pre-existing cells that provide the necessary template for perpetuation of the interactome.


What this means is there are non-Mendelian heritable factors that are templated from a pre-existing interactome not just from the DNA.

For starters, since neo-Darwinian modern Synthesis is an unhappy marriage of the good science of Mendelian genetics and the speculative ""science"" of Darwinian ideas,  this non-Mendelian feature of biology would seem now to invalidate lots of Neo-Darwinism.

DNA focuses information into highly localized regions.  For example, if I wanted to know what part of the DNA codes for Cytochrome-C,  I can get a good estimate of the all the exon loci on a DNA that participate in coding Cytochrome-C in eukaryotes and an almost exact if not exact location of the coding loci in a given prokaryote (which don't have exons).

In contrast, since the interactome is separately implemented as numerous copies in numerous parts of the cell, to change the interactome, one has to simultaneously change identical parts in ALL parts of the cell.  

For lack of a better word, I will use the word ""mutation"" to change the interactome, but these mutations would have to be simultaneous in all or most parts of the cell in order to resist the apparent deep redundancy in the interactome.  

The redundancy prevents too much of a fundamental change in the cell architecture despite modest injury.  How do we know this?

When we fire DNA bullets using Gene Guns into the cell in order to change the DNA, the damage to the cytoplasm is recoverable, yet it is in the cytoplasm lots of interactome activity is happening and it is this very interactome that serves as a reproductive template for descendent cell lines.  

We tend to think the information in the interactome may not count that much since we can damage parts of the cell and the cell self heals, whereas the reality is that the information is so deeply redundant in the interactome that self-healing is possible and that the information in the interactome is not localized like the information in DNA.

Conclusion, gradual change to basic form is not possible.  Not only are there not smooth gradual changes possible in evolving one highly specific protein to another highly specific protein, even moreso, the interactome cannot change gradually especially since it is redundantly copied in so many parts of the cell that it allows cells the ability to self heal.

Self-healing means that a pre-existing template somewhere is referenced to do a reconstruction.  If one interactome part (say part A) is injured, then other interactome parts (say parts B,C....ZZZZ) host the information to rebuild it (part A). 

Given this complication, de novo changes are not that feasible since they would require many simultaneous changes rather than step-wise changes claimed by evolutionary theory.",0,1439052518,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3g9atz/levinthal_paradox_of_protein_interactome_vs/

According to this website : The Interdependency of Lipid Membranes and Membrane Proteins
The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. The interdependency of lipid membranes and membrane proteins suggests that lipid bilayers and membrane proteins co-evolved together with membrane bioenergetics.

The nonsense of this assertion is evident. How could the membrane proteins co-evolve, if they had to be manufactured in the machinery , protected by the cell membrane ? 

The cell membrane contains various types of proteins, including ion channel proteins, proton pumps, G proteins, and enzymes. These membrane proteins function cooperatively to allow ions to penetrate the lipid bilayer. 

The ER and Golgi apparatus together constitute the endomembrane compartment in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The endomembrane compartment is a major site of lipid synthesis, and the ER is where not only lipids are synthesized, but membrane-bound proteins and secretory proteins are also made. 

So in order to make cell membranes, the Endoplasmic Recticulum is required. But also the Golgi Apparatus, the peroxysome, and the mitochondria. But these only function, if protected and encapsulated in the cell membrane. What came first, the cell membrane, or the endoplasmic recticulum ? This is one of many other catch22 situations in the cell, which indicate that the cell could not emerge in a stepwise gradual manner, as proponents of natural mechanisms want to make us believe.

Not only is the cell membrane intricate and complex (and certainly not random), but it has tuning parameters such as the degree to which the phospholipid tails are saturated. It is another example of a sophisticated biological design about which evolutionists can only speculate. Random mutations must have luckily assembled molecular mechanisms which sense environmental challenges and respond to them by altering the phospholipid population in the membrane in just the right way. Such designs are tremendously helpful so of course they would have been preserved by natural selection. It is yet another example of how silly evolutionary theory is in light of scientific facts.",5,1438664025,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3fpmrz/cell_membranes_origins_through_natural_mechanisms/

Many of the sources are not cited and it's never clear when one paragraph is written by one author and the next by another (short of googling individual phrases).  

But it is an outstanding introduction into my hypothesis that DNA doesn't contain all the information and technology to build a human which likely lies in the 3rd alphabet of life.  If the hypothesis is correct, DNA is not central in importance but must share its significance with the Sugar Code.  

DNA contains information on how parts are built, but not all the information on how parts are to be put together.

Some highlights:
&gt;from Stephen C. Meyers book : Darwin's doubt : 


&gt;The Sugar Code 

&gt;Biologists know of an additional source of epigenetic information stored in the arrangement of sugar  molecules on the exterior surface of the cell membrane. Sugars can be attached to the lipid molecules that make up the membrane itself (in which case they are called ""glycolipids""), or they can be attached to the proteins embedded in the membrane (in which case they are called ""glycoproteins""). Since simple sugars can be combined in many more ways than amino acids, which make up proteins, the resulting cell surface patterns can be enormously complex. As biologist Ronald Schnaar explains, ""Each [sugar] building block can assume several different positions. It is as if an A could serve as four different letters, depending on whether it was standing upright, turned upside down, or laid on either of its sides. In fact, seven simple sugars can be rearranged to form hundreds of thousands of  unique words, most of which have no more than five letters.""

&gt;These sequence-specific information-rich structures influence the arrangement of different cell types during embryological development. Thus, some cell biologists now refer to the arrangements of sugar molecules as the ""sugar code"" and compare these sequences to the digitally encoded information stored in DNA. As biochemist Hans-Joachim Gabius notes, sugars provide a system  with ""high-density coding"" that is ""essential to allow cells to communicate efficiently and swiftly  through complex surface interactions.""26 According to Gabius, ""These [sugar] molecules surpass amino acids and nucleotides by far in information-storing capacity."" 1 So the precisely arranged sugar  molecules on the surface of cells clearly represent another source of information independent of that stored in DNA base sequences. 

&gt;NEO-DARWINISM AND THE CHALLENGE OF EPIGENETIC INFORMATION 

&gt;These different sources of epigenetic information in embryonic cells pose an enormous challenge to  the sufficiency of the neo-Darwinian mechanism. According to neo-Darwinism, new information, form, and structure arise from natural selection acting on random mutations arising at a very low level within the biological hierarchy—within the genetic text. Yet both body-plan formation during embryological development and major morphological innovation during the history of life depend upon a specificity of arrangement at a much higher level of the organizational hierarchy, a level that DNA alone does not determine. If DNA isn't wholly responsible for the way an embryo develops— for body-plan morphogenesis—then DNA sequences can mutate indefinitely and still not produce a new body plan, regardless of the amount of time and the number of mutational trials available to the evolutionary process. Genetic mutations are simply the wrong tool for the job at hand.  Even in a best-case scenario—one that ignores the immense improbability of generating new genes by mutation and selection—mutations in DNA sequence would merely produce new genetic information. But building a new body plan requires more than just genetic information. It requires both genetic and epigenetic information—information by definition that is not stored in DNA and thus cannot be generated by mutations to the DNA. It follows that the mechanism of natural selection acting on random mutations in DNA cannot by itself generate novel body plans, such as those that first arose in the Cambrian explosion.

DebateEvolution,3cjppn,angeloitacare,,t2_olzgm,self.DebateEvolution,,On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation,"On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation

Just five nucleobases, also termed the genetic alphabet, are known to dominate the composition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) 

The quest of the origin of the coded information stored in DNA is a unresolved problem .

Lee Strobel writes:

“The six feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly instructions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made … No hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means” (Strobel, p. 282).

However, not only must the specified complex arrangement of the nucleotides stored in DNA be explained, which are the information required to make proteins, but also the origin of the basepairs itself and why only four bases, aka letters were selected, that is, the narrow selection of restricted variety of organic molecules upon which life is based. That is, in the same manner as not only the origin of the poem written through a alphabet might have to be figured out, but the origin of the alphabet itself, that is in our case, why four, and not more or less nucleobases, but also why these four types, that is, why not different nucleobases since there are miriads from which the code could be chosen from. But also, why the assignment at all, rather than none ? Why arised a code, rather than none ? That is not a trivial question, but a fundamental one, which hardly can find good explanations through naturalism, however if a mind is involved, it makes perfect sense, since we know of minds inventing various kinds of alphabets all the time, there are european, asian, russian , japanese, chinese etc. types of alphabets. 

In the paper : On the Origin of the Canonical Nucleobases: An Assessment of Selection Pressures across Chemical and Early Biological Evolution, the author asks : How did nature “decide” upon these specific heterocycles? ( A heterocyclic compound or ring structure is a cyclic compound that has atoms of at least two different elements as members of its ring(s) ) Evidence suggests that many types of heterocycles could have been present on the early Earth. 

the paper continues : The prebiotic formation of polymeric nucleic acids employing the native bases remains, however, a challenging problem to reconcile. 

Hypotheses have proposed that the emerging RNA world may have included many types of nucleobases. This is supported by the extensive utilization of non-canonical nucleobases in extant RNA and the resemblance of many of the modified bases to heterocycles generated in simulated prebiotic chemistry experiments.

So basically, there is no reason why the four extant nucleobases are selected. Any other could be assigned. But then there could be 4, 6, 10 or eventually even more nucleobases to form the language with alphabet, grammar, collection of punctuation marks and regulatory sites, semantics. . This remains a challenging problem for naturalism, not however for intelligent design, where a intelligent designer selected arbitrarly the four bases to create life. 

The authors try to answer the question, stating following : Two such selection pressures may have been related to genetic fidelity and duplex stability ( of the DNA double helix ). Clearly, the considerations applicable to potential prebiotic synthetic pathways do not appear to provide much insight into the selection of the bases of interest. We have not taken into account, however, stability, which is considered by many to be the more important factor regarding prebiotic abundance.

Since when did a prebiotic environment establish "" selection pressures "", and why and how should there have been such goal to reach genetic fidelity and duplex stability ? There is triple stranded DNA, and it has nice stability........ In the paper:

Stable triple-stranded DNA formation and its application to the SNP detection, the authors state :

We have found that a short stretch (30mer or larger) of triple-stranded DNA structure formed at the terminus (or very near) of linear DNA molecules is unusually stable, withstanding heat treatment at as high as 95 degrees C. 

And the base pairs are also different :

The Hoogsteen base pair, consisting of a syn adenine base paired with an anti thymine base, is found in the 2.1 Å resolution structure of the MATα2 homeodomain bound to DNA in a region where a specifically and a non‐specifically bound homeodomain contact overlapping sites. 

The paper then continues : the alphabetic composition is the product of a continual process of refinement that evolved to its current state. 

The only problem with this assertion is that they make things up. How do they know the state of affairs was due to evolution ? They don't know. Atheists however will immediately conclude, because the paper says so, it must be true....... 

Results from simulated prebiotic chemistry experiments conducted over the past fifty years and the ongoing analysis of meteorites provide evidence that not only the native bases were likely present on the early Earth, but so were many others. 

So that means, life had many options, but choose to select just the extant four bases. The authors continue : 

It would seem reasonable to hypothesize that the bases used by nature would have been selected to exhibit some of the highest stabilities against these spontaneous deamination reactions in comparison to alternative nucleobases. 

Here applies the same as said above: Since when did a prebiotic environment establish "" selection pressures "", and why and how should there have been a goal to reach highest stability against these spontaneous deamination reactions in comparison to alternative nucleobases ? It seems almost as if nature had the goal to create life ? 

The authors go on:

Greater persistence in this environment would have given the native bases an advantage over others, possibility facilitating their selective incorporation into the first primitive genetic polymers. 

Again : nature has no mental forsight, and no goals. And so it really does not matter at all, if primitive genetic polymers would have been produced, or not.

DebateEvolution,3arqbc,Jewishskeptic,,t2_n0u7m,self.DebateEvolution,,To the scientists on here: how scientifically plausible do you find creationist counter-arguments?,"In your experience do they simply misrepresent scientific interpretations of evidence and try to skew the evidence in their favor? Or do their counter interpretations and criticisms seem plausible as alternative interpretations of the data?

For example, in [this](http://creation.com/pseudogenes-are-they-non-functional) they claim that natural selection should have cleared pseudo-genes away and they further make the following claims:

&gt;A large fraction of most pseudogenes differ considerably from their alleged parent genes which makes the interpretation of the data questionable.

&gt;Although some pseudogenes such as LINEs and Alus appear to be hierarchically shared between primates, others clearly are not. An example of such a discordancy is the sharing of SINE elements between evolutionarily more-distant organisms to the exclusion of animals of intermediate evolutionary derivation, despite the presence of intact homologous genetic loci in the latter.

&gt;Pseudogene sequences are frequently exchanged. This complicates any interpretation of phylogeny.

&gt;One evolutionary tenet is that pseudogenes such as SINEs and LINEs insert randomly. The independent insertion of such sequences in the genomes of two clearly unrelated animals should therefore be virtually impossible. So the presence of identical sequences at homologous sites in the genomes of two organisms unquestionably indicates common ancestry. However, the independent acquisition of both LINE and SINE elements at the exact site in different animals has now been demonstrated. Moreover, it has now been shown that these elements have insertion hotspots at specific DNA sequences, and at chromosomal cleavage/break sites in bent or coiled DNA.

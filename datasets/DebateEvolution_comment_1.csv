t1_ffv1zah,t3_eurawo,"I went to a elementary-high school that taught YEC. I didn’t know essentially anything about evolution until I got to college. Our biology textbooks even presented everything in a “Christian” light meaning they framed everything from the reference of creation. Things like “cells are so complex but perfect there is no way it could have all come together over billions of years.” However, after years of being essentially indoctrinated and being presented what seemed like very weak refutations of evolution, I was skeptical towards my later years. When I got to college and started taking biology classes, evolution just made sense. In comparison to the outlandish arguments I had heard for creation all my life, evolution is just simple. It makes perfect sense with the data. Those creationist arguments I had seen over and over fell apart very quickly. It’s only since joining this sub have I seen how strongly the YEC community does not/chooses not to understand the basic principles of evolution. It seems to me many deliberately choose not to understand, as seen with PDP throwing out Darwin’s whole argument based upon the definitions of neutral and fitness. They present such weak straw men it’s really just incredible.",1580255256

t1_ffuz3fd,t3_eurawo,"Actually I find it the one classification level that is denied by most people where “Old World Monkey” might give you information on colobus monkeys and cercopiths more often than it will admit that technically all Catarrines are Old World Monkeys, a sister group to the Platyrrines which everyone will agree are monkeys. When trying to set them apart from apes they’ll produce something like this: https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/what-is-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes or this: https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes

So basically if it’s a monkey that falls into the category of human, chimpanzee, siamang, gibbon, bonobo, gorilla, or orangutan then it’s not a monkey. That’s their basic argument when you break it down. Lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers are primates but not monkeys. 

It’s easier to illustrate with phylogenetic relationships.

All living primates have a rhinarium like most mammals still have (a wet nose) which includes the aye-aye, loris, galago, and lemur or they have a dry nose like us. Those with a dry nose are called Haplorhines. Of the dry nosed primates we have tarsiers and simians - you’re one of the other. The simians are either platyrrines which are the New World Monkeys and the Catarrines - this group *would be Old World Monkey* universally but that’s where the problem arises as the sister group to New World Monkeys is split between Apes and Old World Monkeys by those who won’t admit we are monkeys too. The Old World Monkeys that are not apes are things like baboons, macaques, colobus monkeys, langur monkeys, vervets and so forth. 

For “monkey” to have any useful meaning for a single group of animals we’re talking about one of two choices. The baboons and macaques are not monkeys or apes are too. Instead they tend to create two groups of monkeys with apes being more closely related to one of these groups than the two monkey groups are related to each other. The ancestor of all Catarrines looked like a monkey and animals like Aegyptopithecus were ape-like monkeys showing a clear trend towards becoming an ape and Proconsul was a monkey-like ape being about no more ape-like at first glance than the Barbary apes and langur monkeys which are a couple tailless non-ape monkeys. The most noticeable trait that sets us apart is the lack of a tail, but apes also have greater shoulder rotation and can hang from their arms from branches where most other monkeys walk on top of the branches or use a prehensile tail. We also have larger monkey brains than the other monkeys wound up with so this is also pointed at as well. It’s more about what we have that other monkeys don’t have or a trait *most but not all* monkeys have in common that we don’t share - even though the ancestor of the entirety of Catarrines was a monkey it diverged from the population that gave rise to monkeys in America and the ancestor of both groups, was itself a monkey, but a lot more lemur-like without the the defining traits that lemurs acquired since that split like such as the tooth comb - lorises are on our side of that split but Eosimius is a small monkey that might be a better representation of a common monkey ancestor for both groups and another animal called darwinius is likely the same thing for the branch leading to lemurs. This is what I was referring to as these two groups show many similarities but something more like purgatorias or another group similar would be more like the universal primate ancestor. I don’t need to really tell you about all of these evolutionary relationships, though, because my main point is that the ancestor of platyrrines and Catarrines is something we’d classify as a monkey, the ancestor of apes and cercopiths, too, we’d consider a monkey, and even Aegyptopithecus and similar animals leading to apes still had many of the defining characteristics of living monkeys and a whole lot less of the characteristics of living apes that gradually built up leading to us through animals like Proconsul, Nikalipithecus, and Sahelanthropus or similar looking groups so that what once was a monkey should still be a monkey, where evolution accepting apes-as-monkey deniers will suggest that, though apes derived from monkeys, they’re no longer monkeys anymore and such an idea is counter to how evolution works. You can’t outgrow your ancestry and for two groups to be actually the same thing (like monkeys) all of the in between groups and divergent lineages all the way back to and including the common ancestor would also have to be a monkey but monkeys could originate at that point as monkeys diverged from other dry nosed primates. Excluding Catarrines from being monkeys solves this problem differently to where the shared ancestor of both groups, wasn’t yet a monkey and neither were the descendants until they diverged from Catarrines and with prehensile tails and other traits they could be distinguished from all non-monkey primates more clearly having unique traits not found in our ancestry - and with this alternative “monkeys” from the old world are not monkeys either no matter the similarities they share with the monkeys from America.",1580253973
t1_ffuy4y1,t3_eurawo,"&gt;the tragedy of it all is that creationists are actively trying to argue that god's majestic creation is fatally, hopelessly flawed in implementation

Spot on. The entire YEC view is a complete turn off. I used to adhere to it because I like science, and thought I could prove my faith with science. 

What did I find? Strawmen. Misrepresentations of the data. Self-deception in their work where they convince themselves that they ""don't challenge the empirical data, only the evolutionist interpretation"", even though work by the same authors had them saying, outright, [""That data has to be flawed somehow. Their methodology is seeing things that aren't actually there. It can't represent something real, because if it is, then we can't explain it.""](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/green-river-formation)

Frankly the YEC idea of creation makes the entire thing feel like a joke. Time and time again they propose miracles not even mentioned in the bible just because, if such miracles didn't occur, they can't save their model (looking at you, RATE). It's such a pathetic setup, and behaves so poorly, I can't see why anyone would bother. To me it seems way better to just stick to ""The bible said it, end of discussion"" and admit you don't know what to make of the data, rather than twisting it so horribly. But I guess people are supposed to accept it all, wholesale, no matter how blatantly flawed, because ""muh cruel animal death"" or something. Personally, I'll take a couple of theological challenges over absolute disgusting misrepresentation and flat out denial of the empirical data.",1580253834
t1_fftm7xl,t3_eurawo,"&gt; True in the closing statement, almost true when it comes to monkeys.

Nice info!

I recall someone from a country where the word ""monkey"" customarily includes great apes, interchangeable. Knowing they are technically wrong does not matter.

There is also [Captain Simian &amp; the Space Monkeys (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQVm48moTMM) blurring the distinction, to reconcile, even though it's only a cartoon. The audience wants/wanted to be one of the Space Monkeys, proud to be one too. In a case like that it's hard to ruin the fun by disqualifying them by saying they are not a monkey, then turn the channel. 

Science writing requires precision while for cartoons monkey is close enough for the creators and audience. It's too outside of science to matter to research, but exceptions do exist elsewhere. I was allowing for this type of situation.",1580252107

t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"I'm looking at his current math and I'm not sure if they even set up the probabilities correctly (never mind the conclusions/strawman attached to it). Here's what PDP is mathing:   


&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs  with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any  one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now  let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate  of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 1/27 = 2/810  
&gt;  
&gt;(First  mutation has a probability of 2 choices out of a possible set of 30  choices. Second mutation has only one choice out of a remaining 27  possible (9 remaining bases with 3 choices each)).  
&gt;  
&gt;One of them only?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 26/27 = 52/810  


The issue with the above math is that it assumes a search space of all possible base pairs across our hypothetical genome at each state. That's not actually what the problem is asking for, it is asking for the probability of mutation at 1 locus and then asking what is the probability that the locus mutates again to a specific allele (the ancestral). The PDP math shows all possible allele mutations across the genome and not the likelihood of mutation occurring at single locus.

See if this makes sense:

1)  Mutation rate of 2 base pairs (bp) per generation, with a 100% probability of occurring.

2) 10 nucleotides in our genome of interest with no mutation bias

3) The probability that a nucleotide changes at any locus is 1/10 + 1/9 = 0.21 (because we are assuming that a single locus only mutates once per generation).

4)  The probability that a locus changes once is 0.21 (we don't actually care what the nucleotide changes to, so we don't multiple by 1/3)

5) The probability that an already mutated locus changes back to the original locus is then 0.21 \* 1/3 = 0.07 or 7% for the posterior probability. For the prior it is 0.21\*0.21\*1/3 = 0.0148 \~ 0.015 or 1.5%.",1580244445
t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"He really is just a lost cause. He doesn’t agree with your definition of neutral as having no effect on fitness. He just quotes out of context the same two papers as “proof” that the population geneticist community thinks there are no such things as neutral mutations. He refuses to do the simple math because your starting definitions are “wrong.” It’s incredible because that wasn’t even why he thought you were wrong initially, just that you did the math wrong. I really don’t get this guy. I’ve only had one discussion with him and gave up after two responses because he was frustrating me so badly. He needs to stop using Kimura and Eyre-Walker/Keightley as his “irrefutable proof.” Scientists do not rely on two papers used out of context when constructing a thesis/hypothesis/whatever, and they certainly do not rely on two papers used out of context to challenge a well established theory. It’s honestly disgraceful to science in general and scientists everywhere. If he is going to try and challenge a theory, he needs to do a full literature review worthy of being published in a peer reviewed journal, and literature reviews are no easy task. They have hundreds of sources and are often times longer than 30-40 pages. They take months to draft and much longer with the review process.

&gt;&gt;Its worth pointing out that as you saturate viable mutations, your chance of back mutations increases.

&gt;&gt;No, it totally, absolutely is true. The independent probabilities are equal. The first mutation is only a given after it has occurred.

In fact, there are many new selection hypotheses that replaced natural selection and are still being underdetermined by the evidence.

It's a matter of tailoring the data to fit the theory, now, as long as you follow the natural selection template, you can make ""jack sparrow is king of the pirates"" entirely compatible with the theory.

I just find it odd that no evolutionist considers this a problem and instead resorts to personal attacks.

t1_fft6v71,t3_eurawo,"The dishonesty continues:

&gt;Here is one of the entries in our very long discussion, written by DarwinZDF42:

&gt;&gt;Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A after that first mutation happens. In the second instance, the first mutation has already happened. Its probability is 1. So we're considering the two events independently, and the probabilities are approximately equal. With me?

&gt;This is a complete misdirection when talking about back mutations, because we are NOT talking about independent probabilities. The first mutation, being a given, has a probability of 1 (as he has said), but the back mutation has a probability of 1/30 (in his example). He concluded their probabilities are roughly equal, but you tell me: is 30/30 roughly equal to 1/30?

How many times do I have to say it? I'm comparing the probability *of the first mutation, before it happens*, with the probability of the back mutation, *after the first occurs.*

t1_fft1yuz,t3_eurawo,"Because the evidence is of mutations that occur that result in fitness, death, or are effectively neutral with most of them having little to no noticeable effect on survival. The claim of genetic entropy is that perfect genomes degrade over time - all mutations are deleterious and that’s not what we find. Mutations that result in three potential outcomes not only change the allele frequency over time but result in multiple lineages accumulating different mutations so that if these differences piled up for long enough the populations would continue to diverge - the process by which speciation occurs. The idea that organisms evolve with guidance or some end result also doesn’t hold up when the lineages are evolving in all directions as you’d expect from a blind process. And, finally, if natural selection was allowed to purify the gene pool the observed results trend towards the more beneficial mutations as the detrimental ones are slowly weeded out of the gene pool. In this experiment the gene pool was kept consistent and all of the organisms in each population were treated equally being provided everything they need to survive where in nature they’d compete for these resources and the ones not as good at it would eventually just die without passing on their broken genetics. 

Everything is as predicted and described by evolutionary theory, nothing about this is possible if the mutations never occurred or if they were all driven towards the same goal and when beneficial mutations do arise making populations more fit for survival than their ancestors it is a blatant contradiction to the idea that this can’t happen. Yet it continues to happen even when natural selection is effectively removed from the equation.",1580215346

Backup shuttles? Backup solid state boosters? Backup astronauts on board?

Or is it possible you didn't think this through?

If you're going to play the snide semantics game, then I can too, but that seems thoroughly counterproductive to discussion. I am trying to be nice: the least you can do is refrain from being a dick about it.

The shuttle was moreover designed to go to places where if shit broke, NOBODY WAS COMING TO FIX IT. Very, very special case.

That is not how we typically design things, because in most cases, we have engineers handy to come fix stuff. Desktop computers are not designed to be self-reliant, self-repairing independent installations. Saying ""lol backup ur data"" has nothing to do with this. Personal user data is irrelevant to this question. 

Whether there is user data or not, if the HD with the OS on a computer goes boom, *the computer is fucked*. We do not design computers to innately handle internal hard disk failure, even though we know it totally happens. We COULD, obviously, but there is no need. Far easier to just go buy another HD, or another computer. 

Life does not have this luxury, and nor is life designed.

Now let's get back on topic: if you cannot say (without context) which sequence has more information, or even determine which is mutated, then you *cannot* say mutations always reduce information.

Secondly, since back mutations can occur, you also cannot say mutations always reduce information (because the back mutation will increase 'information' by whatever arbitrary unit you chose).

Could you address THESE points rather than attempting to digress?

(by the way, the handbrake is for holding the car stationary once stopped, the footbrake is for actually stopping. I feel I should point this out.

t1_ffr7eyw,t3_etjksh,"&gt; Redundancy is not an important feature in any complex machine we build: if the hard disk on my computer dies, my computer is fucked.

You need to read this: [zen and the art of IT backup](https://gist.github.com/nooges/817e5f4afa7be612863a7270222c36ff). If your data is not backed up, essentially, you do not have any data. Computer redundancy: RAID is good, but now we can also sync thing to the cloud, there are also companies like Acronis that specialize in data backup.  I hope this help and you can start backing up your data. Otherwise you might as well just throw your hard disk away now, because it will fail sooner or later.

Have you considered that we have a hand brake AND a foot brake in a car, two completely separate braking systems (one better than the other)?

&gt; Generally if we need something to be robust, we just make it simpler, so broken bits are easier to replace.

Well, not simpler. The space shuttle was one of the most complex pieces of machinery ever created. It had multiple backups of everything (life support, also multiple computers that checked each other for errors). But it was designed to be modular so that bits are easier to replace.

&gt;A [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/ffrep0z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) between myself and DarwinZDF42 explored the relationship between probabilities and back mutations. He was insistent that a back mutation was roughly equal in probability to the original, and in so doing he aims to suggest that they are a significant factor to consider which ameliorates the problem of deleterious mutations in the genome. This could not be further from the truth, and I'll try to succinctly explain why using a simple math example.

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.

&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?

&gt;1/30 \* 1/30 = 1/900

&gt;One of them only?

&gt;1/30 \* 29/30 = 29/900

&gt;You can see that new mutations are highly more probable than back mutations.

&gt;**EDIT: I changed this post because I decided that my original formulation was unintentionally misleading, since back-mutations happen from one generation to the next, not within the confines of a single generation of mutations.**

&gt;Please feel free to comment with any corrections if you have any.

&amp;nbsp;

This *still* isn't addressing the point I made. I'm talking about a *single* mutation occurring, and then the *single* back mutation occurring. The probability of the first mutation occurring is equal to the probability of the back mutation, given that that the first mutation has already occurred.

They are quite similar even when we compare the coding regions of humans and dogs, cats, pigs, and cows as well, but the similarity drops to about 84%. This is the type of pattern we find in the genetics such that by just comparing that and the same genes located in the same locations including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses that shows clear points of divergence from a common ancestor.

As expected, we find that when comparing our own genetics to those of chimpanzees is there not only 98.8% similarity comparing the coding genes and 96% when we compare the entire genome but we also find the same genes in the same locations with the most significant differences found in the intergenous regions and in the chromosome fusion. Of course, there are several mutations within the coding regions as well that set us apart like 400 million differences across 3 billion base pairs which, though only a 1.2% difference is still a lot more than you’d fine in a single generation or even 6000 years, for example.",1580183351
t3_eurawo,t3_eurawo,"[Still at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/), still doesn't understand probabilities, now making a *different* argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

Y'all see this shit?

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;Now we can do some very simple math to find out which is more likely-- getting two different mutations, or getting a back mutation of the first mutation in our second mutation.

&gt;The first of the two mutations is not specified--it is random and it could be anything. So the probability of the first mutation is 1. All values equally likely.

&gt;Now for the second mutation. If it is NOT a back mutation, then that means we have only one value which is disallowed: the value that would produce a back mutation. Since the first mutation took one possible value away from us, that leaves us 29 remaining possibilities. That is a likelihood of 29/30.

&gt;Since for compound probabilities we multiply, then the likelihood of getting two mutations and NOT having the second reverse the first would be (1) * (29/30). We have a high probability of not reversing the first mutation. Notice how the level of certainty that we will NOT get a back mutation only goes up and up the larger the number of possibilities becomes.

&gt;Contrariwise, if we want to see the likelihood of getting two mutations and having the second one reverse the first one ( a back mutation ), we just multiply our two compound probabilities once more, this time inverting the number. We landed on one of the 30 possible choices with mutation #1, and so for the second mutation we have only one possible mutation out of 30 that would result in a back mutation. That's 1/30.

&gt;I hope this simple explanation will suffice to explain why back mutations are so unlikely. In our oversimplified example of a tiny genome of 10 base pairs (compared to 3 billion), the difference in probability for getting a back mutation is the difference of 29/30 versus 1/30 or .967 compared to .033.

Compare that to what I wrote before:

&gt;Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. Assuming all are equally likely (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30.

&gt;With me so far? Great.

&gt;So the first A mutates to G.

&gt;Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates back to A? 

(I left the obvious answer - 1/30 - unstated.)

The point is *not* that the back mutation is as likely as *all of the other mutations*. The point is that the back mutation is as likely as *the original mutation was before that first mutation occurred*. 

&amp;nbsp;

And a few hours ago, Paul got that that was what I was saying, but thought I had the math wrong:

&gt;The probability of getting both those mutations together is 1/30 * 1/30, which is 1/900.

&amp;nbsp;

But now, the story has changed, and he's saying I made a claim that I never made. 

I'm trying to set an example and be really nice to people, even when I think they're being shady. But this is some bullshit. Paul is a liar, straight up.

t1_ffvb9n0,t3_euzput,"Two separate things here.

First, this is not what I meant. Paul originally said Darwin misunderstood basic probability theory. You've only changed the neutral mutations and the number of base pairs to model the entire genome (Darwin explicitly said he was working with a 1000 base pairs), but you are not otherwise correcting any mathematical flaw in Darwin's point. So this is irrelevant to whether or not his maths is ""totally insane"", or whether he is incorrectly modelling independent probabilities, which he is just not.

(Note that Paul ended up saying [he hadn't even evaluated the maths](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/ffthi8a/), *after* he felt qualified to dismiss it as bunk. He doubled down on his own misunderstanding. It was a futile discussion.)

But, looking at your argument on its independent merits, I have two main immediate issues:

Firstly, you're making the classic creationist assumption of the perfect starting genome. That's the only way you get 200 million into that equation, and it's not something any evolutionist would accept. Populations that exist now have by definition been reproducing for hundreds of millions of years and regions of the genome that are *effectively* non-functional may well have reached that equilibrium long ago.

Secondly, the 20k years to extinction is an assertion with no empirical evidence. Once the fitness effect of a mutation starts to actually matter, selection will kick in. And yes, that threshold will often be much higher than the equilibrium point for deleterious/beneficial mutations.",1580261418
t3_evdw0f,t3_evdw0f,How is it possible to have the genetic diversity present in human beings from a single source? (Eve was created of Adam),1580260701
t1_fftgxsh,t3_euzput,"OK, I just modeled his equilibrium thing, but with more accurate values. I used 0.1/0/99.9 b/n/d. This is because, as Paul pointed out, there are no neutral mutations, only effectively neutral. But, I’ll give Darwin the benefit of the doubt by using his definition of neutral mutations for the calculation.

I also used 3000000000 (3 bil) for possible mutation sites, because this is the approximate size of the human genome. If there are any other animal genome sizes you would want to measure this with, just divide my result by 3 bil/ genome size.

Anyway,
&gt; But as deleterious mutations accumulate, the ratio changes, just like the simple examples above. Where’s the crossover point? 

The crossover point for the human genome is, not 7, not 330, but *998 million mutations*. By dividing this by 100 mutations per gen, then multiplying for 20 years per gen, I got that it would take *200 million years to reach equilibrium*.

OK, so since genetic entropy would take only about 20 thousand years to degrade the genome to extinction, I believe it is clear that equilibrium cannot save evolution.

From the introduction:

&gt;The proceedings include the research findings of 29 scientists who represent a diverse spectrum  of  scientific  disciplines,  including information  theory,  computer  science, numerical simulation, thermodynamics, evolutionary theory, whole  organism biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, genetics, physics, biophysics, mathematics, and linguistics.These scientists generally agreed on three crucial points:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Information  is  the  key  to  understanding life.  Within  the  simplest  cell there exists  an immense flow  of  information  through  a  mind-boggling  system  of information  networks.  There  is  constant  and  multidirectional  communication between   proteins,   RNAs,   and   DNAs,   and   these   biological   information networks are in many ways comparable to the internet.   
&gt;  
&gt;2. These   biological   information   systems   appear   to   greatly   surpass   human information  technologies.  Such  information  systems  cannot  possibly  operate until  all  the  countless  components  of  the  system  are  in  place -including hardware, software, multiple languages, storage/transmission of communicable prescriptive  information  units,  error  testing/correction  systems,  designated senders/receivers,  etc.    Such  systems  must  be  comprehensive  and  coherently integrated   before   they   can   effectively   operate.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. The   enormous   amounts   of   information   found   within   any   cell,   and   the irreducibly complex nature of information systems, can no longer rationally be attributed  to just the  mutation/selection process. New perspectives are  needed that  might  help  us  better  understand  the  nature,  origin,  and  maintenance  of biological information.",1580255495
t1_ffuxym2,t3_eupqxz,"&gt;Litterally all the support for this you've presented has been mined quotes that don't actually say anything on the distribution.

That's completely wrong. You've got blinders on, but I can't take them off for you. Only you can choose to do that. I understand that it won't be easy, because if you do that you'll have to abandon your whole worldview and start fresh. Nobody really wants to have to do that.",1580252383
t1_ffuxym2,t3_eupqxz,"&gt;  You shouldn't make any assumption at all.

Without assuming at the very least a net zero effect (normal distribution), there's no way you can even cling to any hope that evolution might work. But I don't even think that would save it because even if you ignore all the neutrals, the net effect of all the other mutations is still deleterious! So at best you'd have NS working to remove everything and barely managing to keep things at a constant level. You'd still never get forward evolution.

&gt;That's actually the most egregious quote you've presented so far because the paper you took that from is all about showing the opposite of the point you're trying to prove.

If you read what I wrote, I acknowledged that. The whole point of that paper is that they are saying ""nearly neutral damaging mutations are well-known, but if that's all we've got then evolution won't work. We have to find a way to show that there are beneficial mutations to balance them out."" And I don't think they were successful. For one thing they make one assumption that is known to be bad: they assume that synonymous mutations are ""neutral"" (in context I think they mean of no effect at all). [But that's known to be false.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/45952)",1580251856
t1_ffuuq5o,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; Cars that did reproduce would be even more complex than the ones we do have. Making that irrelevant. And what does the assumption of beginnings have to do with my statement here? Nothing. What we do have now is a highly complex machine, just like cars.

Reproducing organisms face selection and a beginning assumption is required if you think that an infentesimally small change, immeasurable change is going to be almost always in one direction.

&gt; Again, there are no zeros.

Centered. C e n t e r e d. An average effect of zero, not an individual effect of zero.

&gt;  or you are going to have to take the completely counterintuitive step of claiming that the distribution of effects will be totally different for small mutations, compared to large; and there's no reason at all to say that.

No. You shouldn't make any assumption at all. There is no data to support any distribution. It's immeasurable by definition.

&gt; Helpful enough to somehow counteract all the decline we know is definitely happening.

Litterally all the support for this you've presented has been mined quotes that don't actually say anything on the distribution.

&gt; Although we expect slightly advantageous mutations to exist, currently there is only limited evidence for their existence in real populations

That paper is all about measurable fitness effects (so not the neutral ones that are topical) and they go in to demonstrate their hypothesis of their existence with a natural experiment. That's actually the most egregious quote you've presented so far because the paper you took that from is all about showing the opposite of the point you're trying to prove.",1580251475

&gt;It actually does. You can have one large beneficial change, 40 huge deleterious changes, and everything else centered at net 0 and still have average deleterious.

Again, there are no zeros. All of them are either beneficial or deleterious. So you are forced into the spot where you can either admit that they are going to have the same distribution, roughly, regardless of size, or you are going to have to take the completely counterintuitive step of claiming that the distribution of effects will be totally different for small mutations, compared to large; and there's no reason at all to say that.

See the corner you're backed into now? You're pinning all your hopes for evolution on the prospect that somehow, a big proportion of very tiny mutations are helpful. Helpful enough to somehow counteract all the decline we know is definitely happening.

But our friends the experts paint a different picture, even as they attempt furiously to rescue the theory of evolution by searching out these beneficial mutations:

t1_ffurp1n,t3_eupqxz,"&gt; So you're suggesting that all the info we know about mutations that comes from the kind that we can measure should just be thrown out the window and ignored when it comes to mutations that are too small to measure? Somehow the likelihood of beneficial vs deleterious would be completely different for these two classes? I'm not buying that for an instant.

You should not make assumptions of quantitative effects when you cant quantify them.

If you get an A-&gt;G mutation in a nonregualtory, nonexpressed, nonbinding region of the genome, you shouldn't assume it will have a deleterious effect when the only differences known are the use of one less carbon and one more nitrogen.

&gt; You want to really understand mutations? Pick any complex machine, like a car for example. Then take a hammer and pick any component of that machine at random and hit it with your hammer. Hit it really hard, and that's a mutation with measurable fitness impact. Hit it softly and now you've got a nearly neutral mutation. Is that clear enough for you?

Cars don't reproduce and we cant assume the genome was optimized to begin with.

&gt; As Gerrish et al put it, mutations are ""indiscriminate alterations"" of complexity, and as such, by nature they are bound to be more deleterious on average than beneficial. Whether they are small or large changes makes no difference.

Not a position on whether or not the near neutral mutations are deleterious, only that they have fitness effects. 

&gt; ""In summary, the vast majority of mutations are deleterious. This is one of the most well-established principles of evolutionary genetics, supported by both molecular and quantitative-genetic data.""

That paper is based on a bunch of other papers that measured fitness effects. Doesn't talk about mutations that are effectively neutral. Its obvious you're misinterpreting his words too, because the first paper you cited is also written by him, and his entire section on neutral mutations is summed up by ""it depends,"" and never actually quantifies probability within the category of neutral. He does explicitly say though that ""...as little as 5% and as much as 50% of mutations are deleterious"" in non-coding regions (a significant portion of eukaryotes genomes) depending on the organism. For humans, that value was 5%.

&gt; Even the simplest of living organisms are highly complex. Mutations—indiscriminate alterations of such complexity—are much more likely to be harmful than beneficial.

Again, not a paper that looks at neutral mutation effects. This is a paper about quantifying mutation impacts. We're talking mutations that impact too little to quantify.

This is a discussion on whether or not changing the genome size affects the rate of back mutations, not whether or not those are frequent to begin with. For point mutations, (not assuming that your first mutations are guaranteed to happen), the chance of a point mutation swapping back is more or less (mutation rate)*1/3. This is independent of genome size when mutation rate is a metric of mutations/base.

This becomes more important as you saturate the genome with deleterious mutations, because a higher percentage of bases that mutate will have mutated already, but what a critical threshold of non-viability for an individual is, what status modern populations are, or whether or not it matters to a large population's viability is a matter where you and I disagree, but it does not change the math for back mutation rate on a per-loci level.",1580240714

I know you believe this to be true fundamentally, but that's certainly not the case for me or any other atheist I personally know. The world doesn't make any sense in the context of just about any religious view that includes an omni-benevolent deity such as the Judaic god. when I became an atheist and let go of those unfounded beliefs the world and everything in it, how it works and every observation made sense. There was a ginormous release of tension caused by the cognitive dissonance that I maintained between what I was taught about god and what I could see for myself to be true about the world.

Your math calculations in your original post are irrelevant (I have no idea if they contain any errors as such), because they are based on a false premise.

In reality, the number of mutations is also probabilistic. In an actual organism with a genome of 10 bases and a mutation rate of .2/base, you can get more or less mutations than 2. My formulas consider that scenario. Similarity, the probability of only one would be 1/15*(4/5 + 2/15), or (the chance of one mutating back)*(the chance of the the other not mutating + the chance of the other mutating wrong).

1-point mutation rate/3 is the probability that the base does correct. We are raising this to the above power because we want the probability that every base fails to have a back mutation.

You subtract everything by one to get the likelyhood of at least one base correcting.

The probability of all bases correcting is (mutation rate)/3^(previously mutated bases).

Of course it is. If you think this is what Darwin's equilibrium model does not take this into account you just haven't read it properly.

So, rather than continuing to misrepresent the argument, I suggest you rewrite his model, in a way that you think is more statistically accurate, such that it does not tend to an equilibrium.

I'll copy-paste the conclusion for you to make this easier. Just copy this, tweak the bit you think is based on faulty maths and show me how that changes the conclusion. Remember, the maths is ""totally insane"", right? So this should be easy.

&gt;Let’s say, what, 99% of mutations are deleterious, and only 0.1% are beneficial. And also that there is zero selection. Is that sufficiently pessimistic for creationists? And let’s work with 1000 sites.

&gt;So the expected ratio at the start, in percentages, would be 0.1/0.9/99 b/n/d.

The fact that a mutation will occur is a given. This is based on known mutation rates. So in my example, we have a mutation rate of 2. It is a given that two mutations will happen. Their probability is 100%.

When I said it is highly misleading, that is another way of calling it a red herring. It is true that if you look at a given possible mutation, its independent probability is the same as its back mutation, at least in theory. But the reason I said that is wrong to say that is because we are not looking at independent probabilities in the discussion of back mutations.

We are asking, after a mutation has occurred, what is the likelihood that it will back mutate? And the chances of that turn out to be very low, and it's easy to see why. If you want to keep trying to prop up that sinking ship, go right ahead, you can sink right along with him.",1580217736

You can say, if you like, that this point is somehow a red herring, but you *cannot* say it is false.

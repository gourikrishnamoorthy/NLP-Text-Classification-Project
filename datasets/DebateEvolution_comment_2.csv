t1_ffv1zah,t3_eurawo,"I went to a elementary-high school that taught YEC. I didn’t know essentially anything about evolution until I got to college. Our biology textbooks even presented everything in a “Christian” light meaning they framed everything from the reference of creation. Things like “cells are so complex but perfect there is no way it could have all come together over billions of years.” However, after years of being essentially indoctrinated and being presented what seemed like very weak refutations of evolution, I was skeptical towards my later years. When I got to college and started taking biology classes, evolution just made sense. In comparison to the outlandish arguments I had heard for creation all my life, evolution is just simple. It makes perfect sense with the data. Those creationist arguments I had seen over and over fell apart very quickly. It’s only since joining this sub have I seen how strongly the YEC community does not/chooses not to understand the basic principles of evolution. It seems to me many deliberately choose not to understand, as seen with PDP throwing out Darwin’s whole argument based upon the definitions of neutral and fitness. They present such weak straw men it’s really just incredible.",1580255256

t1_ffuz3fd,t3_eurawo,"Actually I find it the one classification level that is denied by most people where “Old World Monkey” might give you information on colobus monkeys and cercopiths more often than it will admit that technically all Catarrines are Old World Monkeys, a sister group to the Platyrrines which everyone will agree are monkeys. When trying to set them apart from apes they’ll produce something like this: https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/what-is-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes or this: https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-monkeys-and-apes

So basically if it’s a monkey that falls into the category of human, chimpanzee, siamang, gibbon, bonobo, gorilla, or orangutan then it’s not a monkey. That’s their basic argument when you break it down. Lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers are primates but not monkeys. 

It’s easier to illustrate with phylogenetic relationships.

All living primates have a rhinarium like most mammals still have (a wet nose) which includes the aye-aye, loris, galago, and lemur or they have a dry nose like us. Those with a dry nose are called Haplorhines. Of the dry nosed primates we have tarsiers and simians - you’re one of the other. The simians are either platyrrines which are the New World Monkeys and the Catarrines - this group *would be Old World Monkey* universally but that’s where the problem arises as the sister group to New World Monkeys is split between Apes and Old World Monkeys by those who won’t admit we are monkeys too. The Old World Monkeys that are not apes are things like baboons, macaques, colobus monkeys, langur monkeys, vervets and so forth. 

For “monkey” to have any useful meaning for a single group of animals we’re talking about one of two choices. The baboons and macaques are not monkeys or apes are too. Instead they tend to create two groups of monkeys with apes being more closely related to one of these groups than the two monkey groups are related to each other. The ancestor of all Catarrines looked like a monkey and animals like Aegyptopithecus were ape-like monkeys showing a clear trend towards becoming an ape and Proconsul was a monkey-like ape being about no more ape-like at first glance than the Barbary apes and langur monkeys which are a couple tailless non-ape monkeys. The most noticeable trait that sets us apart is the lack of a tail, but apes also have greater shoulder rotation and can hang from their arms from branches where most other monkeys walk on top of the branches or use a prehensile tail. We also have larger monkey brains than the other monkeys wound up with so this is also pointed at as well. It’s more about what we have that other monkeys don’t have or a trait *most but not all* monkeys have in common that we don’t share - even though the ancestor of the entirety of Catarrines was a monkey it diverged from the population that gave rise to monkeys in America and the ancestor of both groups, was itself a monkey, but a lot more lemur-like without the the defining traits that lemurs acquired since that split like such as the tooth comb - lorises are on our side of that split but Eosimius is a small monkey that might be a better representation of a common monkey ancestor for both groups and another animal called darwinius is likely the same thing for the branch leading to lemurs. This is what I was referring to as these two groups show many similarities but something more like purgatorias or another group similar would be more like the universal primate ancestor. I don’t need to really tell you about all of these evolutionary relationships, though, because my main point is that the ancestor of platyrrines and Catarrines is something we’d classify as a monkey, the ancestor of apes and cercopiths, too, we’d consider a monkey, and even Aegyptopithecus and similar animals leading to apes still had many of the defining characteristics of living monkeys and a whole lot less of the characteristics of living apes that gradually built up leading to us through animals like Proconsul, Nikalipithecus, and Sahelanthropus or similar looking groups so that what once was a monkey should still be a monkey, where evolution accepting apes-as-monkey deniers will suggest that, though apes derived from monkeys, they’re no longer monkeys anymore and such an idea is counter to how evolution works. You can’t outgrow your ancestry and for two groups to be actually the same thing (like monkeys) all of the in between groups and divergent lineages all the way back to and including the common ancestor would also have to be a monkey but monkeys could originate at that point as monkeys diverged from other dry nosed primates. Excluding Catarrines from being monkeys solves this problem differently to where the shared ancestor of both groups, wasn’t yet a monkey and neither were the descendants until they diverged from Catarrines and with prehensile tails and other traits they could be distinguished from all non-monkey primates more clearly having unique traits not found in our ancestry - and with this alternative “monkeys” from the old world are not monkeys either no matter the similarities they share with the monkeys from America.",1580253973
t1_ffuy4y1,t3_eurawo,"&gt;the tragedy of it all is that creationists are actively trying to argue that god's majestic creation is fatally, hopelessly flawed in implementation

Spot on. The entire YEC view is a complete turn off. I used to adhere to it because I like science, and thought I could prove my faith with science. 

What did I find? Strawmen. Misrepresentations of the data. Self-deception in their work where they convince themselves that they ""don't challenge the empirical data, only the evolutionist interpretation"", even though work by the same authors had them saying, outright, [""That data has to be flawed somehow. Their methodology is seeing things that aren't actually there. It can't represent something real, because if it is, then we can't explain it.""](https://sites.google.com/site/respondingtocreationism/home/documents/green-river-formation)

Frankly the YEC idea of creation makes the entire thing feel like a joke. Time and time again they propose miracles not even mentioned in the bible just because, if such miracles didn't occur, they can't save their model (looking at you, RATE). It's such a pathetic setup, and behaves so poorly, I can't see why anyone would bother. To me it seems way better to just stick to ""The bible said it, end of discussion"" and admit you don't know what to make of the data, rather than twisting it so horribly. But I guess people are supposed to accept it all, wholesale, no matter how blatantly flawed, because ""muh cruel animal death"" or something. Personally, I'll take a couple of theological challenges over absolute disgusting misrepresentation and flat out denial of the empirical data.",1580253834
t1_fftm7xl,t3_eurawo,"&gt; True in the closing statement, almost true when it comes to monkeys.

Nice info!

I recall someone from a country where the word ""monkey"" customarily includes great apes, interchangeable. Knowing they are technically wrong does not matter.

There is also [Captain Simian &amp; the Space Monkeys (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQVm48moTMM) blurring the distinction, to reconcile, even though it's only a cartoon. The audience wants/wanted to be one of the Space Monkeys, proud to be one too. In a case like that it's hard to ruin the fun by disqualifying them by saying they are not a monkey, then turn the channel. 

Science writing requires precision while for cartoons monkey is close enough for the creators and audience. It's too outside of science to matter to research, but exceptions do exist elsewhere. I was allowing for this type of situation.",1580252107

t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"I'm looking at his current math and I'm not sure if they even set up the probabilities correctly (never mind the conclusions/strawman attached to it). Here's what PDP is mathing:   


&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs  with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any  one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now  let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate  of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 1/27 = 2/810  
&gt;  
&gt;(First  mutation has a probability of 2 choices out of a possible set of 30  choices. Second mutation has only one choice out of a remaining 27  possible (9 remaining bases with 3 choices each)).  
&gt;  
&gt;One of them only?  
&gt;  
&gt;2/30 \* 26/27 = 52/810  


The issue with the above math is that it assumes a search space of all possible base pairs across our hypothetical genome at each state. That's not actually what the problem is asking for, it is asking for the probability of mutation at 1 locus and then asking what is the probability that the locus mutates again to a specific allele (the ancestral). The PDP math shows all possible allele mutations across the genome and not the likelihood of mutation occurring at single locus.

See if this makes sense:

1)  Mutation rate of 2 base pairs (bp) per generation, with a 100% probability of occurring.

2) 10 nucleotides in our genome of interest with no mutation bias

3) The probability that a nucleotide changes at any locus is 1/10 + 1/9 = 0.21 (because we are assuming that a single locus only mutates once per generation).

4)  The probability that a locus changes once is 0.21 (we don't actually care what the nucleotide changes to, so we don't multiple by 1/3)

5) The probability that an already mutated locus changes back to the original locus is then 0.21 \* 1/3 = 0.07 or 7% for the posterior probability. For the prior it is 0.21\*0.21\*1/3 = 0.0148 \~ 0.015 or 1.5%.",1580244445
t1_ffu4bu1,t3_eurawo,"He really is just a lost cause. He doesn’t agree with your definition of neutral as having no effect on fitness. He just quotes out of context the same two papers as “proof” that the population geneticist community thinks there are no such things as neutral mutations. He refuses to do the simple math because your starting definitions are “wrong.” It’s incredible because that wasn’t even why he thought you were wrong initially, just that you did the math wrong. I really don’t get this guy. I’ve only had one discussion with him and gave up after two responses because he was frustrating me so badly. He needs to stop using Kimura and Eyre-Walker/Keightley as his “irrefutable proof.” Scientists do not rely on two papers used out of context when constructing a thesis/hypothesis/whatever, and they certainly do not rely on two papers used out of context to challenge a well established theory. It’s honestly disgraceful to science in general and scientists everywhere. If he is going to try and challenge a theory, he needs to do a full literature review worthy of being published in a peer reviewed journal, and literature reviews are no easy task. They have hundreds of sources and are often times longer than 30-40 pages. They take months to draft and much longer with the review process.

&gt;&gt;Its worth pointing out that as you saturate viable mutations, your chance of back mutations increases.

&gt;&gt;No, it totally, absolutely is true. The independent probabilities are equal. The first mutation is only a given after it has occurred.

In fact, there are many new selection hypotheses that replaced natural selection and are still being underdetermined by the evidence.

It's a matter of tailoring the data to fit the theory, now, as long as you follow the natural selection template, you can make ""jack sparrow is king of the pirates"" entirely compatible with the theory.

I just find it odd that no evolutionist considers this a problem and instead resorts to personal attacks.

t1_fft6v71,t3_eurawo,"The dishonesty continues:

&gt;Here is one of the entries in our very long discussion, written by DarwinZDF42:

&gt;&gt;Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A after that first mutation happens. In the second instance, the first mutation has already happened. Its probability is 1. So we're considering the two events independently, and the probabilities are approximately equal. With me?

&gt;This is a complete misdirection when talking about back mutations, because we are NOT talking about independent probabilities. The first mutation, being a given, has a probability of 1 (as he has said), but the back mutation has a probability of 1/30 (in his example). He concluded their probabilities are roughly equal, but you tell me: is 30/30 roughly equal to 1/30?

How many times do I have to say it? I'm comparing the probability *of the first mutation, before it happens*, with the probability of the back mutation, *after the first occurs.*

t1_fft1yuz,t3_eurawo,"Because the evidence is of mutations that occur that result in fitness, death, or are effectively neutral with most of them having little to no noticeable effect on survival. The claim of genetic entropy is that perfect genomes degrade over time - all mutations are deleterious and that’s not what we find. Mutations that result in three potential outcomes not only change the allele frequency over time but result in multiple lineages accumulating different mutations so that if these differences piled up for long enough the populations would continue to diverge - the process by which speciation occurs. The idea that organisms evolve with guidance or some end result also doesn’t hold up when the lineages are evolving in all directions as you’d expect from a blind process. And, finally, if natural selection was allowed to purify the gene pool the observed results trend towards the more beneficial mutations as the detrimental ones are slowly weeded out of the gene pool. In this experiment the gene pool was kept consistent and all of the organisms in each population were treated equally being provided everything they need to survive where in nature they’d compete for these resources and the ones not as good at it would eventually just die without passing on their broken genetics. 

Everything is as predicted and described by evolutionary theory, nothing about this is possible if the mutations never occurred or if they were all driven towards the same goal and when beneficial mutations do arise making populations more fit for survival than their ancestors it is a blatant contradiction to the idea that this can’t happen. Yet it continues to happen even when natural selection is effectively removed from the equation.",1580215346

Backup shuttles? Backup solid state boosters? Backup astronauts on board?

Or is it possible you didn't think this through?

If you're going to play the snide semantics game, then I can too, but that seems thoroughly counterproductive to discussion. I am trying to be nice: the least you can do is refrain from being a dick about it.

The shuttle was moreover designed to go to places where if shit broke, NOBODY WAS COMING TO FIX IT. Very, very special case.

That is not how we typically design things, because in most cases, we have engineers handy to come fix stuff. Desktop computers are not designed to be self-reliant, self-repairing independent installations. Saying ""lol backup ur data"" has nothing to do with this. Personal user data is irrelevant to this question. 

Whether there is user data or not, if the HD with the OS on a computer goes boom, *the computer is fucked*. We do not design computers to innately handle internal hard disk failure, even though we know it totally happens. We COULD, obviously, but there is no need. Far easier to just go buy another HD, or another computer. 

Life does not have this luxury, and nor is life designed.

Now let's get back on topic: if you cannot say (without context) which sequence has more information, or even determine which is mutated, then you *cannot* say mutations always reduce information.

Secondly, since back mutations can occur, you also cannot say mutations always reduce information (because the back mutation will increase 'information' by whatever arbitrary unit you chose).

Could you address THESE points rather than attempting to digress?

(by the way, the handbrake is for holding the car stationary once stopped, the footbrake is for actually stopping. I feel I should point this out.

t1_ffr7eyw,t3_etjksh,"&gt; Redundancy is not an important feature in any complex machine we build: if the hard disk on my computer dies, my computer is fucked.

You need to read this: [zen and the art of IT backup](https://gist.github.com/nooges/817e5f4afa7be612863a7270222c36ff). If your data is not backed up, essentially, you do not have any data. Computer redundancy: RAID is good, but now we can also sync thing to the cloud, there are also companies like Acronis that specialize in data backup.  I hope this help and you can start backing up your data. Otherwise you might as well just throw your hard disk away now, because it will fail sooner or later.

Have you considered that we have a hand brake AND a foot brake in a car, two completely separate braking systems (one better than the other)?

&gt; Generally if we need something to be robust, we just make it simpler, so broken bits are easier to replace.

Well, not simpler. The space shuttle was one of the most complex pieces of machinery ever created. It had multiple backups of everything (life support, also multiple computers that checked each other for errors). But it was designed to be modular so that bits are easier to replace.

&gt;A [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/eupqxz/lets_pick_apart_darwinzdf42s_grand_theory_of/ffrep0z?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) between myself and DarwinZDF42 explored the relationship between probabilities and back mutations. He was insistent that a back mutation was roughly equal in probability to the original, and in so doing he aims to suggest that they are a significant factor to consider which ameliorates the problem of deleterious mutations in the genome. This could not be further from the truth, and I'll try to succinctly explain why using a simple math example.

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10\*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;So Generation 1: two ***different*** changes out of 30 possible changes.

&gt;Now in generation 2, what is the probability of getting both mutations reversed?

&gt;1/30 \* 1/30 = 1/900

&gt;One of them only?

&gt;1/30 \* 29/30 = 29/900

&gt;You can see that new mutations are highly more probable than back mutations.

&gt;**EDIT: I changed this post because I decided that my original formulation was unintentionally misleading, since back-mutations happen from one generation to the next, not within the confines of a single generation of mutations.**

&gt;Please feel free to comment with any corrections if you have any.

&amp;nbsp;

This *still* isn't addressing the point I made. I'm talking about a *single* mutation occurring, and then the *single* back mutation occurring. The probability of the first mutation occurring is equal to the probability of the back mutation, given that that the first mutation has already occurred.

They are quite similar even when we compare the coding regions of humans and dogs, cats, pigs, and cows as well, but the similarity drops to about 84%. This is the type of pattern we find in the genetics such that by just comparing that and the same genes located in the same locations including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses that shows clear points of divergence from a common ancestor.

As expected, we find that when comparing our own genetics to those of chimpanzees is there not only 98.8% similarity comparing the coding genes and 96% when we compare the entire genome but we also find the same genes in the same locations with the most significant differences found in the intergenous regions and in the chromosome fusion. Of course, there are several mutations within the coding regions as well that set us apart like 400 million differences across 3 billion base pairs which, though only a 1.2% difference is still a lot more than you’d fine in a single generation or even 6000 years, for example.",1580183351
t3_eurawo,t3_eurawo,"[Still at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/euzput/lets_explain_compound_probabilities_as_they/), still doesn't understand probabilities, now making a *different* argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

Y'all see this shit?

&gt;Let us say that we have 10 base pairs with 3 possible changes to the value. That makes the probability of any one particular mutation equal to 1 / (10*3), or 1/30.

&gt;Now let us further stipulate that in one generation we have a mutation rate of 2. That means we know that exactly two mutations will be passed on.

&gt;Now we can do some very simple math to find out which is more likely-- getting two different mutations, or getting a back mutation of the first mutation in our second mutation.

&gt;The first of the two mutations is not specified--it is random and it could be anything. So the probability of the first mutation is 1. All values equally likely.

&gt;Now for the second mutation. If it is NOT a back mutation, then that means we have only one value which is disallowed: the value that would produce a back mutation. Since the first mutation took one possible value away from us, that leaves us 29 remaining possibilities. That is a likelihood of 29/30.

&gt;Since for compound probabilities we multiply, then the likelihood of getting two mutations and NOT having the second reverse the first would be (1) * (29/30). We have a high probability of not reversing the first mutation. Notice how the level of certainty that we will NOT get a back mutation only goes up and up the larger the number of possibilities becomes.

&gt;Contrariwise, if we want to see the likelihood of getting two mutations and having the second one reverse the first one ( a back mutation ), we just multiply our two compound probabilities once more, this time inverting the number. We landed on one of the 30 possible choices with mutation #1, and so for the second mutation we have only one possible mutation out of 30 that would result in a back mutation. That's 1/30.

&gt;I hope this simple explanation will suffice to explain why back mutations are so unlikely. In our oversimplified example of a tiny genome of 10 base pairs (compared to 3 billion), the difference in probability for getting a back mutation is the difference of 29/30 versus 1/30 or .967 compared to .033.

Compare that to what I wrote before:

&gt;Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. Assuming all are equally likely (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30.

&gt;With me so far? Great.

&gt;So the first A mutates to G.

&gt;Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates back to A? 

(I left the obvious answer - 1/30 - unstated.)

The point is *not* that the back mutation is as likely as *all of the other mutations*. The point is that the back mutation is as likely as *the original mutation was before that first mutation occurred*. 

&amp;nbsp;

And a few hours ago, Paul got that that was what I was saying, but thought I had the math wrong:

&gt;The probability of getting both those mutations together is 1/30 * 1/30, which is 1/900.

&amp;nbsp;

But now, the story has changed, and he's saying I made a claim that I never made. 

I'm trying to set an example and be really nice to people, even when I think they're being shady. But this is some bullshit. Paul is a liar, straight up.

I already have.  Your argument is pointless because your premise is flawed.

&gt;Not a single theory can be said to be true

Theories are, in general, the best explanations we have for a given phenomenon. It truly logical sense, they are the **least strong** explanation we have.  That said, I challenge you to find anything wrong with the theory of evolution, keeping in mind that there is nothing within the theory that says that it must occur slowly.

t1_ffruo8l,t3_eurawo,"In the MA experiments, they assess fitness in ""steps"" usually with each generation or a subset of generations.

Each step assumes a number of mutations on the basis of previously established mutation rates in the organism.   


When sequencing became cheaper and easier, like in the Dillon paper that PDP often quotes, whole-genome sequencing was done in addition to the fitness evaluation. The proportion of neutral mutations in sequenced MA's (even with all the ridiculous non-natural caveats) is still higher than deleterious mutations. In Keightley's early works, like this 2002/2003 paper, MA experiments are looking at amino-acid changing/altering mutations. As Keightley correctly summarizes in the DFE paper for 2007, the majority of mutations across the genome are neutral.",1580167544

To clarify:

Darwin's own theory-saving pretext, and the excuse that has been echoed ever since, for the fact-theory incongruity is that of ""incompleteness of the fossil record"". The fossils unearthed so far, we are told, constitute a non-representative sample.

Gould and Elredge are having none of this. Now, make no mistake, punctuated equilibria is not being offered as a supplement or additive to phyletic gradualism, but a rival theory, as betrayed in the full title of their paper: ""Punctuated Equilibria: An Alternative to Phyletic Gradualism"".

G&amp;E go on to list their own four tenets of punctuated equilibria as a contrast to those of phyletic gradualism adumbrated above (and I quote once more):

(1) New species arise by the splitting of lineages

(2) New species develop rapidly

(3) A small sub-population of the ancestral form gives rise to the new species

(4) The new species originates in a very small part of the ancestral species' geographical extent -- in an isolated area at the periphery of the range

Reproductive fitness of each lineage was assessed by the number of fruits per plant and the number of seeds per fruit, the latter obtained as an average over four fruits. No sequencing was performed to look across all mutations occurring per generation; rather, phenotype was used to infer the fitness of the mutation type. This means it is impossible to show/count the number of neutral mutations via this experiment since the mutations must necessarily affect phenotype to be observed--which neutral mutations don't do. Further, the phenotype being measured may not account for the entire genome, but rather only the genes/portions that are responsible for fruit/seed bearing.   


Since the phenotype between generation changes, the mutations are necessarily affecting the amino-acids/coding-regions in some way. Therefore, Keightley correctly refers to them as amino-acid mutations.

No doubt this is leading up to the common, boring creationist tactic of claiming ""faith in science"", which is one of the most pernicious and enduring forms of theistic equivocation. Confidence in careful procedures and collection of evidence is not the same as your unevidenced faith in the supernatural. One is objective, the other is not. One bases its conclusions upon evidence, while you will never have your conclusion changed on the basis of evidence, as it was never determined by that means to begin with.

It’s an ironic argument, because the claim of the existence of an atheist metaphysics is itself based on an assumption that not only does empirical knowledge require faith, but it claims to explain everything. However, naturalism necessarily does exactly the opposite, leaving a potentially infinite space under the domain of the unknown. The very nature of our quest to expand our sphere of knowledge, the knowledge paradigm itself, forces us to accept and make peace with the unknown, for it will always be with us.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think theHating is trying to distinguish between what is fact and what is for all practical purposes fact.

&gt; These explanations do not fit all the facts, and so they become revised, battles rage on and the indefensible is defended with utter contempt for what science ought to be about.

I would disagree with the idea that at this present moment explanations we have for evolution do not fit the evidence we have it. I haven't been presented with any evidence that contradicts any of today's Theory of Evolution's principles (the theory is basically a crystallization of the observations anyways), but evolution has been adjusted in the past and will probably be in the future, like with the broad acceptance of punctuated equilibrium.

Similarly, every biologist I've interacted with is ""sure"" what causes evolution, to the same extent of the above (We've seen mutation happen. We've seen natural selection, artificial selection, population bottlenecks), in that ""sure"" is a position of extremely high confidence that still leaves room for the potential of falsification or an additional selection method discovery.

&gt;&gt; The first toss already happened. It's in the past. The probability is one.

&gt;&gt;If I asked ""what's the probability of, in the future, a mutation occurring, *followed by* its back mutation"", you'd be on track. But that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, *given that a mutation has already occurred*, what is the probability of the back mutation occurring?

&gt;DarwinZDF42  
Where we stand in time is irrelevant. The probability of two tails in a row is always going to be 1/4, regardless of whether we are in the middle of flipping or whether we have not yet flipped.

This is incredible. I'm finished with this exchange, so Paul can respond however, because he's so far off base and obviously not going to magically start understanding how probability works. 

For everyone else:

I have a coin, and I ask ""what's the probability that I get tails twice in a row?""

The answer is .25; 0.5 for the first toss, 0.5 for the second, they are independent, so you multiply the separate probabilities to get the combined probability. 

I flip the first coin. Tails. 

Now I ask ""what's the probability of a second tails?""

The answer is 0.5. I already did the first toss. It came up tails. That probability is now 1, because that event has already occurred in the past. And the probability of tails on the second toss is 0.5.

&amp;nbsp;

It works the same for mutations. The probability of two mutations at any one site is extremely low. But if a mutation happens, the probability of the back mutation is approximately the same as the original mutation that already occurred.

b) GE supporters believe that MA  experiments adequately represent natural evolutionary phenomena and that  the results favor the GE hypothesis. Here’s why that is untrue:

1. MA experiments **do not allow natural selection to happen**, meaning that the deleterious mutations cannot be selected out from the populations.
2. Bacterial strains used in MA experiments have certain DNA repair genes (such as mutS) **disabled so that MORE mutations occur** i.e.—not natural
3. The coding regions in these species represent **HUGE portions of their total genome 80-90% versus 10-20% noncoding**. The human genome is about 1% coding.
4. The **majority of mutations are not deleterious**  \[as shown in these experiments and in direct opposition to GE premises  stated earlier\] and that only rarely occurring mutations cause the  fitness declination observed in these studies.

No. The only reason I pointed that out is to inform you that there is at least one definition of ""information"" which is absolutely incompatible with Creationist usage of the word, so you really should *define your friggin' terms*.

&gt; You think that you need some clarity to tell if Creationists are referring to white noise or not when they use the term ""information""?

No. I think there are a number of different definitions of ""information"". I think that if someone wants to make a *scientific argument* about evolution which depends on ""information"", it really does behoove that someone to *explain which definition of ""information"" they're using*.

&gt;Anyone who uses the word ""information"" when discussing something with you…

See above re: ""scientific argument"". In the context of everyday life, I'm generally happy not to raise a fuss over the specifics of ""information"". But in the context of a discussion of science, yeah, I do want terms to be defined. When I'm talking to someone who shares my understanding of science, I tend to assume that they accept the standard mainstream definitions used in standard mainstream science; when I'm talking to a Creationist—a Young-Earth Creationist in particular—I *cannot* necessarily assume that they accept standard mainstream definitions, so asking for definitions may be required from time to time.

On to your questions.

&gt;1. Does DNA contain information?

In my view, no. It doesn't contain *any* ""information"". DNA is a molecule, and its constituent parts just go bopping around in strict accordance to the laws of chemistry and physics. In my view, people who make noise about ""information"" in DNA are employing figurative language that isn't an accurate description of the *actual* state of affairs, generally for the purpose of explaining things in a manner more easily comprehensible than if they stuck strictly to 100% accuracy.

By analogy, it's *philosophically possible* to explain the operation of a car engine *wholly and entirely* in terms of the interactions of the atoms/molecules of the fuel and engine, right? But such an explanation would be *extremely* bulky/awkward, and would, most likely, fail to be useful as an *explanation* of how that engine works.

&gt;2. Is DNA a code or perhaps a language?

Code: Define ""code"". If ""code"" is a means of transferring information from one mind to another using a protocol which prevents other minds from intercepting and comprehending that information along the way, then no, DNA is *not* a ""code"". If ""code"" is something else, then maybe?

Language: No. If it were a language, whatever message it's conveying could be translated into English. And yet, nobody seems to have any interest in making any efforts to translate DNA into English. If it were a language, the message it's conveying would have been transmitted from one mind, with the intent of being received by one or more other minds. And yet, nobody seems to have any idea of who's sending the alleged ""message"" that's conveyed by DNA, nor does anyone seem to have any interest in figuring out who the intended receiver of said alleged ""message"" might be.",1580159042

It's not and if you're not going to read or attempt to understand  what is actually being studied here then we should end the conversation.  The 2002 Keightley and Lynch paper, entitled ""TOWARD A REALISTIC MODEL  OF MUTATIONS AFFECTING FITNESS,"" is a response paper to a mutational  accumulation experiment done by  Shaw et al.--this is that whole 'peer  review' process going on. The ""other"" scientists claimed that their MA  experiment yielded 50% **ADVANTAGEOUS** mutations--which  every model of evolution denies is possible, including Neutral Theory.  MA experiments artificially prevent natural selection from occurring by  controlling mating, population size, and providing unlimited  food/resources. The entire paper is referring to mutations in coding  regions as is the Shaw et al. experiment. Quotes from the paper that you  ignored:

""However, in all taxa examined so far, average values of C are in  excess of 0.7 (e.g., Ohta 1995; Eyre-Walker et al. 2002), implying that  the majority of **amino-acid altering mutations** are deleterious.""

""There is nothing obviously unusual with respect to A. thaliana in  this regard. Wright et al. (2002) and S. Wright (pers. comm.) have  recently investigated constraint in **the protein-coding genes of two species**  of Arabi- dopsis, A. lyrata (an outcrosser) and A. thaliana (a natural  inbreeder), using an outgroup to infer lineage-specific constraint.  Estimates for C are 0.88 in both species, despite their different  systems of mating; C is likely to underestimate the fraction of **amino-acid mutations** that are deleterious due to fixation of advantageous **amino-acid mutations** and **purifying selection acting at synonymous sites** (Eyre-Walker et al. 2002).""

It is not only true, it is *demonstrably* true.

&gt;  it's a truth of language and doesn't require evidence for it to be true.

That's a nonsense statement.  The truth is what the facts are.  The facts are that evolution occurs, we have seen it, tested it, repeated it, and have an over-abundance of evidence that shows it.  

&gt; it most certainly does not fit all the facts.

It does, because that is a conclusion reached as a *result* of the facts.  Again, you're trying to do science backwards by picking something and attempting to fit the facts to it.  That's a common creationist tactic.

&gt; can you name an organism that isn't fit? 

Look at every population that has ever gone extinct.  That's 99% of every population that has ever existed.

&gt;  Some populations tend to undergo little to no change at all even as they are reproducing for 100s millions of years.

That's irrelevant.  If they have sufficient fitness to remain in their environmental niche, and no significant pressure on them, then their morphology may not change much; certain morphological forms seem to be at fitness plateaus or peaks for specific environments, and have independently evolved numerous times over the ages.  Sharks and crocodiles are prime examples of this.  However, if you took an early example of the population and a late one, or a modern and prehistoric shark, for example, you'd see significant genetic differences, as well as other changes in soft tissue, organ structure, immune system, and many other areas that don't translate well to the fossils that we see today.

t1_ffrcga1,t3_etledc,"From /u/pauldouglasprice 

&gt;u/DarwinZDF42 I can literally remember having this same mental block when I was learning about this in high school. How can the probability be different when you're flipping the same coin? How does the first flip influence the probability of getting the same result any number of times in a row? The way I got past this block was to realize that we are not considering them independently at all. We are asking the question, what is the probability of these two independent events both happening? You would never expect to keep flipping a coin over and over and get the same result each time, even though that is technically possible and even though the probability (1/2) is the same each time. It's multiplicative. Each time you flip, the odds of flipping it again to get the same result go down by an order of magnitude.

&gt;This is also why we find it highly strange to see that lightning has struck the same place twice. Because lighting can strike anywhere, and there are lots of places for it to strike. This is why back mutations are negligible. And that's one reason why you'll never reach this imaginary equilibrium you keep talking about.

Still not getting it. 

Say you have 10 bases, all A. There are ten sites that can mutate, and each site has 3 possible outcomes - C, G, or T. So you have 30 possible mutations that can occur. *Assuming all are equally likely* (again, not strictly true, but close enough), the probability of any one of them happening is 1/30. 

With me so far? Great.

So the first A mutates to G. 

Now you have 10 sites - a single G followed by nine A's. What's the probability that the G mutates *back* to A?

Or this: https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201648

Seems like when you look at the actual data it supports common ancestry between all domains and nothing even remotely related to a dependency tree. I mean there are some well preserved genes, but in one of those links they point out the huge variability within the DNA of all living organisms so they use ribosomal RNA to provide a phylogeny while the other compares while genomes anyway to provide much of the same picture but argues for a closer evolutionary divergence between the two prokaryotic domains. And they both support the idea that eukaryotes are based mostly on the genetics of Archaea but have also incorporated bacterial symbionts that have since became organelles. 

Then of course once we get to eukaryotes the evolutionary progression leading to us and most other lineages is shared here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMLnubJLPuw0dzD0AvAHAotW

And when we are talking about just animals with bones, here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9o6KRlci4eBBreHKyuGwHSwhmSfpxwqv

And then of course there is the overall genetic similarity and patterns of similarity (epigenetics) on top of just the overall similarity percentages like us and chimpanzees having the same genes in the same location and the same gene regulation and the same endogenous retroviruses and the same pseudogenes broken because of the same mutation so that the majority of our differences are found in the non-coding regions where we are only 96% identical comparing all of the differences to the genome like 610 deletions in the Alu regions, duplicated genes, broken genes in us that still work in them, and a chromosome fusion. By comparing the genes functional in both lineages we have something like 3 billion base pairs and only 400 million differences among them which is still a lot but this amounts to a 1.2% difference. Where it matters most we are 98.8% identical to chimpanzees where both of our lineages are 98.2-98.4% identical to gorillas showing that chimpanzees are more like us than either of us are like gorillas. And once you can overcome the idea of us being separately created from the other apes it isn’t much of a problem for how all of this can be traced all the way back to the findings in both of the links I provided. And if that wasn’t enough, we also have extinct transitional forms from Sahelanthropus dated to the point of our divergence from the line leading to chimpanzees and bonobos to Orrorin to Ardipithecus showing a trend towards more dedicated bipedalism which continues in Australopithecus until the boundary between them and our genus is fuzzy because of Australopithecus sediba, Homo naledi, Homo habilis, and Kenyanthropus platyops as well as a recently discovered transitional form that may actually be the actual transition leading to our genus despite all of these others being on the edge of what it takes to be classified as either of these two genera. And once firmly within the genus Homo the trend towards becoming humans is followed up by erectus, heidelbergensis, and rhodesiensis as well as a few others in between like antecessor. 

Dependency trees don’t really hold up or explain why we have these clear evolutionary transitions or all of this genetic evidence for common ancestry even among genes that apparently no longer serve the same function because of a shared mutation.

Humans can’t live long enough to see the full life-cycle of a star, but we can still piece together how that happens from looking at a multitude of examples. There are plenty of things we can never know without a time machine but that doesn’t make our answers unjustified.

&gt; But whether or not our understanding is true is apparently a question not worth answering to you people 🤔

So is your purpose here to complain about how epistemology? Then go to a philosophy sub. Science is the best tentative model we got, all that matters is the amount of evidence and justification for a model. Raising complaints based on some rather poor understandings of the technical minutia, is not the sort of thing that would bring us to “whoa Dude” moments. 

I do care about how “True” our truth is, but what your doing is closer to crying about how evolution is going to be in the same spot as when Newtonian mechanics was replaced by Einstein’s model and therefore everything modern evolution/Newton know was completely wrong and useless. 

But here’s the good news, Newton’s math is still useful for anything not in orbit or going near light speed, and from *everything* we can *currently* tell, evolution at worse will be the same.",1580156269

That is not the contention here.",1580156259
t1_ffjrdoe,t3_etx720,"\&gt; So their argument is essentially that genes we have are dependent on other genes that no longer do a whole lot but take up space? Or are they arguing that multiple lineages had to be fully formed in order to survive or, even better, that cell biology necessarily proves an all at once creation?   


You've missed the point entirely.   Whats the point of writing a rebuttal to something you  don't even now anything about?  disagree or agree you should first make sure you understand what you are debating against.  A quick intro is here  


[https://evolutionnews.org/2018/07/bio-complexity-presents-a-better-model-than-common-ancestry-for-explaining-the-pattern-of-nature/](https://evolutionnews.org/2018/07/bio-complexity-presents-a-better-model-than-common-ancestry-for-explaining-the-pattern-of-nature/)  


\&gt; Even if any of these flawed cases against evolution and common ancestry were accurate it still wouldn’t refute the observable genetic similarities that logically shouldn’t exist at all if the designer was intelligent or had the ability to create what evolution couldn’t explain like crocoducks and feathered horses. 

Actually if correct  it would show that they should logically exist.  I don't think it would  destroy all forms of evolution but it would devastate the unguided versions of it and would fit nicely into Intelligent design.

The dependency graph draws from Computer science and has little to do with ""an all at once creation"" (whatever that is supposed to mean).  Its based on the principles of libraries and dependency injection where  two programs  can share code without ""descent"".    


&gt; If there was really something that demanded a creator that would be something but all they ever have happens to be consistent with evolutionary theory 

Intelligent Design advocates already have that in the laws and constants of the Universe which evolutionary theory doesn't even remotely address (or any other scientific theory  for that matter). Atheist disagree but without much to proffer (which is  why  theism still rules  the world's population).  


&gt; Of course, genetic entropy would only show the limitations of the designer unable to make organisms that are able to evolve and persist without going extinct in less than ten thousand years because of molecular decay. 

Not much of a genetic entropy fan but generally that rebuttal is  weak.  I can create robots to last for a given time  and then decay in function without any limitations.  I don't have to create everlasting robots when doing so does not suit my purposes. Its even a worse  rebuttal to theistic viewpoints where there are natural consequences for  violations of moral law.  


\&gt; Edit: I was looking over there for this dependency graph but while there I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Creation/comments/esd0em/the_moons_origin_is_a_mystery_to_those_who_dont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). The problem is worse than I thought when planetary formation and collision events is where they turn to when they fail at cosmology, biology, chemistry and physics in general.   


whose the ""they""? As far as I know no one at r/creation has anything to do with  the ""dependency graph"".

t1_ffrbz4j,t3_entwuz,"Well, this is kind of what I was thinking at first as well, but alas, it is not true. It is actually quite obviously false if you think about it.

To clarify, I'm not saying that populations of stuff do not change, just that there isnt a single theory that can account for all it's mechanisms.

The definition you're giving me here is false for two obvious reasons:

1) it's a truth of language and doesn't require evidence for it to be true.

2) it most certainly does not fit all the facts.

""Bears with teeth get all the fish""

""Bigger tigers get all the ladies""

However, as it permeates the main theme of my original post, this is not always the case.

t1_ffr11a7,t3_etledc,"From /u/pauldouglasprice :

&gt;Update: DarwinZDF42 doubles down on his bad math concerning back mutations, failing basic probability theory (of the kind I learned in high school):

&gt;&gt;Then Paul objects to bit on back mutations - when A--&gt;B happens, then later B--&gt;A happens. He says that's too rare to consider. On net, such mutations will have approximately equal probability as the original mutations. It's not strictly equal, but close enough for a model as rough as this, considering just the number of possible mutations on each side of the ledger.

&gt;When you want to calculate the probability of the same thing randomly happening twice, you have to **multiply the probabilities**. They are not the *same probability*, or even similar. It is vastly less probable to see the same mutation happen in the same place twice, randomly, than to have it happen there only once. Stay far away from Vegas!

&amp;nbsp;

Dude. Say you have a site that's A. The probability that it mutates to G is approximately equal to the probability that that G mutates back to an A *after that first mutation happens*. In the second instance, *the first mutation has already happened*. It's probability is 1. 

Like I said, this is not strictly true universally. (ssDNA viruses, for example, have a C--&gt;T bias, where C deaminates to T much more rapidly than T changes back to C. But that's a special case.) In general, the forward and reverse substitution rates are close enough that they can be considered equal. Google ""general time reversible model"". 

BTW, are you gonna dispute my math or just take wild potshots like this? If you want to show that I'm wrong, just answer these questions:

Does the relative frequency of *possible* deleterious mutations change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

Does the relative frequency of *possible* beneficial mutations change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

Does the selection coefficient change as deleterious mutations accumulate?

These mutations can be functionally neutral, deleterious, or beneficial and still be termed ""effectively neutral"" depending on the population size.  


A small selection coefficient near zero does not impact fitness--if it did, natural selection could act on it. This is a functionally neutral mutation as it depends on how NS ""perceives"" the mutation and not the size of the population. Functional definitions of neutral, beneficial, and deleterious describe what natural selection does to the mutation i.e.--fitness conferred contingent upon the environment.

t1_ffr2md0,t3_etjksh,"&gt; No, absolutely not. No one can tell. 

Which seems to puncture the entire ""mutations destroy information"" argument completely.

Basically, if you cannot say (without context) which sequence has more information, or even determine which is mutated, then you cannot say mutations always reduce information.

Secondly, since back mutations can occur, you also cannot say mutations always reduce information (because the back mutation will increase 'information' by whatever arbitrary unit you chose).

I absolutely appreciate your honesty here, and you are tackling this with a suitably open mind: you have all the pieces, you just need to put them together.

Note: Redundancy is *not* an important feature in any complex machine we build: if the hard disk on my computer dies, my computer is fucked. We really don't build things to be massively redundant, *especially* complex things. We want them to work at maximum efficiency, not maximum robustness.

Generally if we need something to be robust, we just make it simpler, so broken bits are easier to replace.

Biology works to different constraints: robustness is all, and efficiency is an entirely secondary concern. Mutations occur, and they can be bad. A codon alphabet that reduces the impact of those mutations is more robust than one that doesn't, and of course, it also had to evolve (interestingly, the codon alphabet all life uses is actually only mediocre on the 'optimality' scale: there are better codon charts, but ours is trapped in a local minimum).

There are many theories to explain evolution.

They are fine explanations, but none of them are true.

So I have asked around and landed here, is there a single theory that could reasonably be called ""THE theory of evolution"" and not be utterly vacuous.

So far, many have tried to assert many a theory to be THE theory, and all have failed to encapsulate the raw power of evolution.

My contention is shared by many a respected philosopher, including respected biologists.

I was asked this many times and I have obliged when a link has been provided. One bloke didn't care that I actually read it and asked him what he thought about Ernst Mayr's contentions.

Its always the same with you people; you assume, attack, and nothing is ever moderated because you enjoy life under the veneer of scientific respectability.

Im not asking for under-determined assets of evolution, I'm asking if there exists one asset that can reasonably be called THE theory.  It's a bit of a nuanced plea, and during every step I have acknowledged how I could be wrong.

Although the evolutionistssss here, always hammering on about looking at the evidence, don't wish to accept that the theory (what ever it is today) is likely going to be rejected and reformed again and again because it contains nothing scientific.  What you have is some post hoc categorical knowledge that, indeed, change has occurred, and happens now.  What you, gould, lawrence, dawkins, google, and everyone else here DO NOT have, is a perfect, true theory.

Essentially every single typical creation apologetics point is totally wrong when they say ""Random chance can't do that type of thing"". From the perspective of someone who is thinking deeply about evolution and trying to understand it, it looks as if **evolution is far too** ***orderly***. 

To expound on that more metaphorically than I did in the original post: sometimes to get a higher level of order you simply have to ""add on"" to your current theory (normal science, if you're into Kuhn).

&gt; One of these nucleotide sequences has a mutation. Devoid of any additional context, can you tell me which sequence is mutated, and whether that mutation has ""reduced"" the amount of information or not?

No, absolutely not. No one can tell. So it's not just the coding for amino acids that determines mutations, it's then end result as the protein. Which then makes it harder, because the protein functions in the context of the cell. A folded polypeptide in outer space -- well, no one can tell if it's been mutated to be worse or better than the original polypeptide.

&gt; Does a mutation 'destroy' information when it replaces one codon with another identical codon? 

Actually, aside from redundancy, which is an important design feature in any complex machine that we build, different codons change the speed in which the mRNA is transcribed, and this causes minor subsequent changes in the protein folding later.

Notice that Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. correctly refer to these mutations as *operational rather than functional*. This is specifically because this definition operates on precept of population size--which PDP either doesn't understand or doesn't acknowledge. They are also specifically referring to mutations in protein-coding regions of the genome--which is only 1% of all nucleotide in humans. If PDP or anyone else wants to continue reading the paper, Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. correctly contrast non-coding regions and then summarize the total effects of mutations across both coding and non-coding regions:  


“Unfortunately, accurate measurement of the **effects of single mutations is possible only when they have fairly large effects on fitness** (say &gt;1%; that is, a mutation that increases or decreases viability or fertility by more than 1%)” (ibid.)

“In hominids, which seem to have effective population sizes in the range of 10,000 to 30,000 (Ref. [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29)), the ratio *dn/ds* is less than 0.3 (refs [29](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR29),[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR42)), and **this suggests that fewer than 30% of amino-acid-changing mutations are effectively neutral.**” (ibid.)

“The **proportion of mutations that behave as effectively neutral occurring outside protein-coding sequences** is much less clear.” (ibid.)

“In mammals, the proportion of the **genome that is subject to natural selection is much lower, around 5%** (Refs [55](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR55)–[57](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2146#ref-CR57)). It therefore seems likely that as much as **95%  and as little as 50% of mutations in non-coding DNA are effectively  neutral; therefore, correspondingly, as little as 5% and as much as 50%  of mutations are deleterious.**” (ibid.)

  
It's extremely clear Eyre-Walker, A., and Keightley P.D. (2007) correctly state that the vast majority of mutations across the entire genome are neutral. Additionally, it's a trivial exercise to characterize mutations from the vast sequencing data that we have today and all data (even in highly contrived accumulation experiments) demonstrate that the majority of mutations do not impact fitness whatsoever. PDP wants to quote mine these publications and suggest that mutations which do not impact fitness of the organism *do indeed* impact fitness in a deleterious manner. He does this by continuously quote mining papers and then fails/refuses to show any evidence for this conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

In his post, PDP refers to the Dillon, M. and Cooper, V. (2016) paper: ""The Fitness Effects of Spontaneous Mutations  Nearly Unseen by Selection in a Bacterium with Multiple Chromosomes."" He tries to quote mine this paper again (which I have provided several responses which are ignored), but hilariously this paper actually demonstrates exactly what /u/DarwinZDF42 was talking about. They show an example of a deleterious mutation in two environments that is neutral is another environment:   


""The most consistently deleterious mutational event involved loss of the 0.164-Mb plasmid, which reduced fitness in TSOY and M9MM but not M9MM+CAA."" (ibid.)

""Although all distributions have a mode of near s = 0 and contain mostly lineages with deleterious or neutral fitness, we show that the distribution of effects across lineages is distinct for each environment (see Figure 2). One important difference is that M9MM contains four lineages that are significantly more fit than the ancestor, and unlike in TSOY and M9MM+CAA, lineages whose selection coefficients are not significantly different from 0 in M9MM are no more likely to be negative than they are to be positive (Chi-square test; x2 =0,d.f. =1, P =1) (see Figure 2). This suggests that fewer spontaneous mutations are deleterious for fitness in M9MM, possibly because a greater proportion of genes are unused when metabolizing only a single carbon substrate.""

There are a lot of issues with the use of 'information', and the lack of a concrete definition from the scientific community largely stems from the fact that it is, with respect to nucleotide sequence, very, very difficult to define. Moreover, the effect of *changes* in nucleotide sequence are similarly hard to define or quantify, and in many cases the result of a change is context specific.

It is thus...frustrating when creationists claim that ""all mutations destroy information"" or words to that effect: making that claim presupposes that you can quantify information sufficiently to be able to determine that. I shall illustrate the problems with this position thusly:

AAGCAGCCTGGCCCAGCTCCTGGACTGACCACTGTCAGAGCCCGTAACTATACTGAAT

AAGCAGCCTGGCCCAGCTCCTGGACTGACCACTGTCAGAGCCCGTAAGTATACTGAAT

One of these nucleotide sequences has a mutation. Devoid of any additional context, can you tell me which sequence is mutated, and whether that mutation has ""reduced"" the amount of information or not? 

Now, thus far every creationist that I have posed similar questions to has prevaricated or wandered down some idle thoughtstream about 'specified information' and how you can't say without more specified detail, all of which has led me to conclude, as we all basically suspect, that there is no clear creationist definition of *information* with respect to nucleotide sequence, and that ""all mutations destroy information"" is simply a PRATT that accords nicely with the claim that evolution can't happen, and that also doesn't require too much nuanced thought. 

In summary, yes: nucleotide sequence can absolutely hold information. With a given prearranged schema, we can even use it to store digital data.

With respect to actual genomic information, this becomes far, far less clear. 

1) most nucleotide sequence is non-coding, and most non-coding DNA is also repeat sequence, retroviruses or Alus. Sixteen kilobases of ATGG is, admittedly, a very highly ordered stretch of sequence, but it's also non-coding garbage sequence, and its length can easily be explained by slippage expansion during replication. Is it information? Maybe. Does it do anything? No. Does the fact that it doesn't do anything affect whether it counts as information or not? Well, that's the question, isn't it?

2) Coding sequence probably is the closest you could argue to being 'information' without needing to provide extra clarification, but even here it isn't straightforward: most coding sequence is highly redundant: there are 61 non-stop codons, and only 20 canonical aminos. Some aminos are rare codons, but for others there are as many as 6 different ways to encode them. In many cases the last nucleotide is completely irrelevant. Does a mutation 'destroy' information when it replaces one codon with another identical codon? Furthermore, since TAA, TAG and TGA are the stop codons, any stretch of non-coding nucleotide sequence with a low TA content is likely to contain a significant number of open reading frames. Simple addition of a transcription start site (by mutation) would allow those to be expressed, and some might be useful (antifreeze genes have arisen this way). Does this represent a loss of information?

3) Even coding sequence is not the whole story: most enzymes are ""three or four essential amino acids, and three hundred filler aminos"": outside of the active site, most enzymes can be monkeyed about substantially without affecting activity. Does a mutation that alters a non-important hydrophobic amino acid to another non-important hydrophobic amino acid represent a loss of information? If you like, proteins are closer to the old ""you can read words if the first and last letters are right and the rest are present in the wrong order"" trick: seteencns etssieallny anlooguas to tihs. 

With the added facet that as the only criterion is ""does it work"" (here, can you understand it), there is in fact no 'correct' spelling, only various functional spellings. How do you measure gains or losses in information in such a scenario?

4) Finally, every mutation that occurs can revert. If the argument is that all mutations result in information loss, this implies that A to C is a loss, while C back to A is ALSO a loss, somehow returning to the original state but losing info both times (I have had creationists genuinely try to argue this, so it's worth noting).

In summary, ""DNA CONTAINS INFORMATION"" is not terribly controversial. We all accept this, and evolutionarily it is pretty easy to see how it would arise.

""DNA CONTAINS INFORMATION, AND THUS WAS WRITTEN BY A CREATOR AND IS DESTROYED BY MUTATIONS"" is much more controversial, and requires a much more specific definition of information such that it can be empirically discerned from the more mutation-tolerant evolutionarily generated stuff above.",1580148436

t3_eurawo,t3_eurawo,"The weird thing I found is that his paper does support part of the idea, but not all of the concept of genetic entropy for several reasons:

1. Even if most mutations missed by natural selection were spontaneous and damaging to the original genes, many benefits arose from gene deletions. Our large brain is possible because of them.

2. If ever these genes actually became deleterious for survival they are removed from the gene pool allowing other less damaging mutations to persist

3. Beneficial mutations occur

So basically we have genes stop functioning more often than they gain additional functions where the rates are bad enough to notice 2-12 deletions that don’t immediately result in death and only around 0.5% of the time do they add functionality. When it comes to natural selection it only matters when the threshold is crossed, which the author said rarely happens in this case so that in the evolutionary sense most mutations are neutral when it comes to survival.

The summary of this is that spontaneous mutations tend to damage genes than to add functionality to them, though new functionality can arise at a really low rate but even then there are rarely ever any mutations that result in death or infertility so that all survivable mutations spread through the population and evolution progresses via the same mindless process it always has. Without death caused by these mutations, the relatively low chance of acquiring a beneficial mutation becomes inevitable given enough time and whenever additional mutations make these mutations actually deleterious for survival they result in an evolutionary dead end. The result of this down the line is evolution by natural selection where rare chance mutations eventually outcompete the slightly more common damaging ones. 

This was explained better by PhD holding scientists, but this is my take on it.",1580148344

&gt;Neutral: Does not affect fitness.

He says:

&gt; Effectively neutral mutations DO affect fitness

But he ignores the definition of ""fitness"" three lines down:

&gt;Fitness: Reproductive success.

So all his huffing and puffing about effectively neutral comes back to not liking the actual definition of neutral, because, [he admits](https://creation.com/fitness), doesn't work for creationists:

&gt;Only when we insist that the terms of the debate be fair and accurate will we have any chance to clearly communicate the truth of creation and the bankruptcy of Darwinism to the world at large.

So this opening bit is a pointless rehashing of *that* old argument. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next he takes issue with the argument that the fitness effects of mutations can change. 

I mean, I don't know what to say here. It's not up for debate. You can go on all day about how *most* mutations are deleterious. Fine. Those effects change based on the genetic and ecological context. They are not absolute.

&amp;nbsp;

Then Paul objects to bit on back mutations - when A--&gt;B happens, then later B--&gt;A happens. He says that's too rare to consider. On net, such mutations will have approximately equal probability as the original mutations. It's not strictly equal, but close enough for a model as rough as this, considering just the number of possible mutations on each side of the ledger.  

Same for epistasis. Paul says it's too rare to consider. Fine. The models in the OP don't incorporate it. The assumptions I used are extremely favorable to creationists. Paul, did you even look at the math?

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, he objects to this statement...

&gt;Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated.

...on the grounds that this misrepresents how ""genetic entropy"" works. He says the selection differential stays zero, indefinitely. 

This is *literally impossible* if there is a fitness cost to mutations accumulating, at some point. Unless everyone in the population has *exactly* the same mutations, genotypes, and epigenotypes (not *number* of mutations, but *exact same mutations*) OR they all start off equal (nope) and nobody suffers any fitness cost (required for ""genetic entropy""), there will be differences in fitness, which means some subset of genotypes will have a fitness cost, i.e. a non-zero selection differential. 

&amp;nbsp;

So those are Paul's objections. 

&amp;nbsp;

You know what I'm not seeing here? Paul disputing my numbers. My little models are *extremely* favorable to creationists. 99% deleterious, yet completely unselectable, and only 0.1% beneficial, with deleterious mutations accumulating linearly. Every one of those parameters is unrealistically favorable to creationists. I mean come on. Paul objects *conceptually* to my argument, but he is not doing so *mathematically*. If I'm wrong, I want someone to *show their work*. My mutation rate coefficients in that last model are -0.002 and 0.001. If that's wrong, *what are the correct numbers*? Show *mathematically*, given *your* ratio of b/n/d mutations, that there *isn't* an equilibrium point. That deleterious mutations *do* accumulate infinitely.

Effectively neutral mutations DO affect fitness, but that effect is too small (individually!) to overcome the random effects of drift or 'noise'. It's too weak a signal.

Besides this, however, I want to home in on a few of the most important and salient points he made.

&gt;There are relatively few mutations that are *always* beneficial or deleterious, and the number of possible beneficial or deleterious mutations changes as mutations occur.

This statement plainly runs contrary to science. In reality, the vast majority of all possible mutations are deleterious. The only real variable is *how* deleterious.

**""Although a few select studies have claimed that a substantial fraction of spontaneous mutations are beneficial under certain conditions (Shaw et al. 2002; Silander et al. 2007;Dickinson 2008), evidence from diverse sources strongly suggests that the effect of most spontaneous mutations is to reduce fitness (Kibota and Lynch 1996; Keightley and Caballero 1997; Fry et al. 1999; Vassilieva et al. 2000; Wloch et al. 2001; Zeyl and de Visser 2001; Keightley and Lynch 2003; Trindade et al. 2010; Heilbron et al. 2014).""**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Once a mutation occurs, that specific mutation is removed from the set of possible mutations, and the *back mutation*, the reverse mutation, enters the set of possible mutations.

This possibility is so rare and unlikely as to be completely negligible when considering our fitness distribution. Back mutations are like having lighting strike at the same spot twice, since mutations are random and the genome is very, very large.

Think about this: the human genome contains [3 billion base pairs](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project/Completion-FAQ). What he is saying is that once you change one of these for the worse (most mutations are very small), then it's technically possible that another mutation could come along and hit the same spot and put it back to where it was before.

Well, yeah, that *could* happen, but it's so vastly unlikely as to be negligible. That explains why this is such a rare phenomenon. In some cases, it may even represent evidence of genomic repair mechanisms that are not yet well understood ([in other words, it may not be random at all](https://creation.com/at-last-a-good-mutation))!

&gt;The second reason for this equilibrium is called *epistasis*. This just means that mutations interact.

DarwinZDF42 isn't clear on why epistasis is supposed to help his case. The fact that mutations interact actually makes the whole problem worse for various reasons. For one thing, synergistic epistasis means they work together. This means that the damage caused by multiple deleterious mutations becomes not just additive, but exponential, as the mutations are worse in combination than they would be apart!

And then you have antagonistic epistasis, where they work against each other. This makes beneficial mutations *less helpful*, since sometimes a beneficial mutation ceases being beneficial when combined with another beneficial mutation! This is particularly bad considering how rare these types of mutations are to begin with.

Dr. John Sanford has dealt at length with the problem of epistasis, both in his book and this [exhaustive numerical simulation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814508728_0013). Epistasis is simply no way out of the entropy problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now here I’m going to introduce a major creationist assumption: The vast majority of deleterious mutations that occur are unselectable (i.e. the selection differential is zero), until some threshold amount of mutations has accumulated.

Here he shows that he still does not really understand the problem of genetic entropy. The idea is not that most mutations are unselectable until they reach a certain threshold. Where he got this from I don't know. The idea is that most mutations are unselectable, period. And it isn't technically because they have a selection differential of 0, but because that differential is so small that it is drowned out by other factors. They just keep on damaging things and natural selection keeps on failing to notice them because they are too small.

**""... particularly for multicellular organisms ... most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have such small effects that one cannot measure their fitness consequences.""**

**""In terms of evolutionary dynamics, however, mutations whose effects are very small ... are expected to be dominated by drift rather than selection.""**

The threshold is not at the level of the individual, as even Kimura himself understood. The threshold is at the level of the **population as a whole**. These mutations are happening constantly in every member of the population! Each human being has about 100 new mutations compared to their parents. Selection only works relative to other members of the population, but if everybody is degenerating at roughly the same gradual rate, then selection is powerless to stop this. Do you see DarwinZDF42's attempt at a sleight of hand here?

I anticipated this a while back when I wrote the following article, published in Creation magazine:

**Genetic Entropy: The Silent Killer,** ***Creation*** **41(4):48–50, 2019**

It's not yet published to the website, but I'll quote a short excerpt here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Forced to acknowledge that NS is blind to nearly-neutral mutations, a common evolutionist response is, ‘Once the accumulating damage from the mutations becomes significant, NS will start to remove them.’ But this fails to understand the problem. Natural selection can only weed out individual mutations as they happen. Once mutations have accumulated enough to be a real, noticeable problem, they are then a problem in the entire population, not just in an individual here or there. The whole population cannot be ‘selected away’—except by going extinct!",1580146165

Principle X is a corollary of the idea that the reason life is so diverse is because it changes.

Okay, and you've told me about principle Y, and a generalization under principle Y is just a reasonably concluded to fit under the idea.

My point is that, while these are all fine explanations, they do not capture the everything, they are not stand-alone hypotheses, and in many ways, they contradict eachother.

t1_ffqroot,t3_etjksh,"Of course I understand the intuitive notion of information with which creationists come to this kind of debate, but intuitions aren't a substitute for scientific definitions. I suspect that that intuition, like our every-day use of ""information"", is far too teleological to be of objective use in this context.

Specifically, the problem arises when creationists come to debates like this, confidently wielding the I-word, with nothing more in mind than the famous [Stewart definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it). You illustrate this perfectly by referring to the use of the word in casual speech. Now I don't think *you* are trolling. But I think you might make more of an effort to understand why this is not acceptable to us. It means that a creationist can say ""information is a problem for evolution"" and then, *whatever* empirical evidence we offer in return, can just retort ""nah that's not what I *meant* by information"".

Under such circumstances debate is impossible. So,

- If you want to say, in the colloquial sense, that DNA contains information, or that that's a useful metaphor to understand what DNA does, that's fine and I'll agree with you.

- If you want to say ""DNA contains information"" and then somehow operationalise that fact to define empirical predictions in the creation/evolution debate, I want to know *exactly* what you mean. It doesn't matter what it is - Shannon information, Kolmogorov complexity, whatever - as long as it's objective.

The two situations are not comparable. Reacting to them differently is *not* inconsistency on my part.

Similarly, in response to your second question, those are both metaphors for what DNA does that make sense on many levels, yes. Some of the (wrongly named) [Hockettsian design features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockett%27s_design_features) of natural human language, like duality of patterning and arbitrariness, have an analogue in the genetic code. Which is why, normally, I'd have no problem with expression like *genetic code*, unless - *unless* - you're going to start using this metaphor to transfer *other* properties of one system, like intelligence, to the other (leaving aside for the moment the second problem, viz. that Hockett's design features aren't designed in the first place). That's when you're mistaking a convenient metaphor for a system with the same fundamental properties, and consequently that's when I'll start asking for a higher degree of rigour in your use of terms.

Again, no inconsistency there, and certainly no wilful attempt to misunderstand you.",1580144805
t1_ffjqe7a,t3_etx720,"The Ewert paper? It's worse than that.

They're mostly tracking 'gene families' as defined by poorly-annotated genomes (so a 'gene family' of arbitrarily picked genes that are shared between an ocelot and a lancelet might exclude a very ocelot-like relative because the genome for that is poorly annotated. I went over this with nomenmeum via PM a while back (original text I wrote mostly quoted below):

 

&gt;It is...not a great paper. It is not written terribly, which is a plus, but the methodology has several major flaws which should perhaps be addressed (and which would likely have been spotted during peer review).  
&gt;  
&gt;1) Conceptually, trying to suggest genomes are arranged like javascript dependencies is...just weird. There are a ton of different ways to 'design' software architectures, so focusing on javascript is oddly specific (given the supplementary data files are all .json files, I suspect Ewert just likes working within a java environment). A lot of object-oriented programming architectures actually use very nested-tree-like arrangements: an 'object' with a ton of universally-applicable code, various classes descended from that object, each of which inherits that code but adds modifications, and ongoing nested trees of subclasses extending from those respective lineages, overwriting ancestral inheritances if necessary. It's a remarkably powerful and very parsimonious approach. If I were to posit a designer, that would be the design approach that seemed to best fit the data (but then that would also imply descent).  
&gt;  
&gt;2) The choice of datasets is odd: HOGENOM, for instance, is a dataset specifically aimed at comparative genomics between prokaryote lineages. It contains 1233 prokaryote organisms, but only 37 mammals. The metazoa included in that dataset are for outlier comparative analysis (i.e. ""here is a gene family that seems quite divergent between prokaryote lines, but HEEEEY: here's how different it is to metazoa""). Using that database exclusively for the metazoan component seems baffling, given that either of the other two produced by that group [https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-S6-S3](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-S6-S3) (hovergen or homolens) would have been far, far more apposite.  
&gt;  
&gt;The same criticisms could be levelled at the other dataset choices. If you use datasets with mixed-bag organisms from a variety of widely-spaced clades, you will get odd results. Garbage in, garbage out. This tells you not much about biology, but a lot about the integrity or understanding of the author.  
&gt;  
&gt;3) EvolSim: it's nice he used this, but it also has to be taken in context with the above observation. Evolsim generates nested gene trees of descent, and generates COMPLETE nested trees of descent (i.e. all the descendants are related to an ancestral species, and all that ancestral species' descendants are present). This is nothing like the biological datasets used. A more appropriate methodology would be to run evolsim until it generated a hundred thousand or so descendant species, and then to pick 50 or so at random, thus sampling from widely divergent clades. A converse test (which would have been really nice too) would have been to apply his biological analysis to a dataset of closely-related animals (ideally, ones that even creationists accept are related, like cats or horses).  
&gt;  
&gt;3) Gene families: I have never read such a nebulous and ill-defined variable as 'gene families' are in this paper. He seems to switch between genes and gene families as if they are interchangable (they're not), and it is entirely unclear what the author has defined as a family or whether that definition has been applied to all datasets equivalently. The implication is that he has made a case-by-case assignation approach for each dataset, without attempting to place this assignation within a rational biological framework. He also *specifically* states that he is disregarding sequence information, which is astonishingly bold and also utterly unforgivable. Humans, gorillas and E.coli all have cytochrome C, but comparison of sequence would show that human and gorilla CytC genes are near-identical, while E.coli is massively different. Without a consistent application of 'gene family', grounded in biological reality, the comparisons he makes are largely meaningless.  
&gt;  
&gt;4) Modules, dataset annotation and supplementary data: this is a biggie, so bear with me. The concept of 'modules' is an interesting one, but again presented devoid of biological context: the figure suggesting ""echolocation"" could be a module is very, very simplistic, and the suggestion that echolocation involves a family of genes unique to both bats and dolphins is actively wrong. Some background reading [https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02057-0](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02057-0) [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12511](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12511)  
&gt;  
&gt;The convergent evolution in this instance is the finding that a few genes, specifically concerned with hearing, that have a few specific sites that confer greatly enhanced sensitivity to high frequencies, and that those sites have been independently found by multiple lineages of echolocating mammals. Firstly this shows that mutations can absolutely add functionality to genes (hearing higher frequencies should count as a gain, right?), secondly it shows that these mutations can be empirically identified and distinguished from other, non-function altering mutations (which accumulate in *all* lineages, both echo- and non-echo locating, in a pattern consistent with inheritance), and thirdly, *all of these genes are present in both echolocating and non-echolocating lineages*, which means the sequence-independent family system employed by Ewert *wouldn't even spot this*. Humans have prestin. Dogs have prestin. Bats have prestin. Whales have prestin. *Zebrafish* have prestin. In layman's terms, most biological innovations are modifications of stuff that is already there, NOT addition of unique functional modules.  
&gt;  
&gt;What, then, ARE these modules he proposes? Well, we don't know, because all he lists are things like ""10 gene families are unique to dogs and cows"". He doesn't tell us what those gene families are, not whether the members of that 10-family 'module' suggest any functional interaction. What that 'module' is, basically, is '10 random genes that couldn't be located in the other (limited) metazoan datasets studied'. Probably (again, he doesn't provide any detail). This is bad, bad bad bad, and also suspicious. I don't know whether it's because he doesn't know enough biology to consider this, or because he doesn't want to show it (because 'mixed bag of random genes').  
&gt;  
&gt;And here's the rub: most of these datasets are incomplete. We can sequence genomes, and we can do it well. We usually do so by fragmenting the DNA into millions of short pieces, sequencing them all, and then stitching them back together by alignment. This works really well, but not perfectly, and it also tells you nothing about the functional context of the sequence. Genes within that sequence can be identified computationally (with reasonable success), manually (usually by groups interested in that specific gene, looking for homologues), or by comparison with already identified genes in other organisms. There will almost ALWAYS be some genes in each genome that simply haven't been found (yet). If I were to compare the chicken genome, the mouse genome and the zebrafish genome, I would expect at least a hundred genes to be present in two but not three of the genomes, purely through incomplete annotation. When you consider that these species have some 20000 genes (by implication, 19900 of which are found in all three genomes), this spurious significance vanishes into sampling noise. If I compared mus musculus, mus macedonicus and mus famulus, I would ALSO expect to find around a hundred genes shared by two but not three of the genomes, and I hope we both agree that all three of those are unarguably related (they are all mice). Because he doesn't provide any information as to the 'gene families' that are not shared, it is impossible to query his claims. He even claims (thanks to Hogenom, the dataset that, again, is aimed at prokaryotes) that Zebrafish and Zebrafinches have nineteen unique shared gene families. Aside from being impossible to check (and thus most probably incorrect), this is demonstrably nonsense biologically. What on earth would such a module DO? Is he proposing those 19 gene families are responsible for 'zebra-ness'? Why are those 19 gene families not also shared with ACTUAL zebras?

t1_ffqm6r3,t3_es00mw,"No humans and chimpanzees have the same number of chromosomes (technically) but in humans two of them are fused end to end.

Repeating yourself when you’re wrong about the 84% is dishonest. I’ve shown you with multiple links and in my own response to you that comparing gene sequences that give a phenotypical difference the difference barely over 1%. By comparing everything like pseudogenes, endogenous retroviruses, gene duplication and the fusion of two  chromosomes into one there is a 96% similarity. I’m not even sure where you got the 84% figure from because you didn’t provide any sources. 

When looking for myself I found sources showing that mice are between 85 and 90% the same as us comparing just the coding genes that provide the phenotypical differences but when comparing the entire genome like pseudogenes, gene regulation, genes shifting from one chromosome to another, and events altering the number of total chromosomes the differences climb all the way to 50% between both lineages.

Now comparing the part that matters when discussing expressed phenotypical traits, we are 98.8% the same as chimpanzees, around 98.4% the same as gorillas, 96.7% the same as orangutans, 93% the same as Rhesus monkey, 90% the same as a mouse, 84% the same as a dog, 80% the same as a cow, 60 the same as a chicken, 30% the same several species of fungi. It also does provide a unexpected levels of similarity when we look to organisms that diverged from our lineage earlier like flies who show 61% gene similarity and banana plants that are still 60% the same. 

However, it’s more than just the whole genome similarity or the coding gene similarity that matters because it is the patterns of similarity that really paint a picture that can only be explained by common ancestry. All mammals have a gene, the same gene for making vitamin C. In dry nosed primates and in humans this gene is nonfunctional, meaning we can’t make our own vitamin C, because of the same mutation at the same location. Once this mutation occurred some twenty five million years ago, these genes have accumulated more mutations, which isn’t a problem when the genes no longer serve a function. In another animal that can’t make vitamin C either, it is a different mutation that prevents them from doing it.

We also have endogenous retroviruses consistent with our evolutionary history that follow the same pattern as I mentioned above where the most closely related groups have more of them in the same locations than more distantly related groups. If they don’t serve any useful function they accumulate mutations and these mutations that they contain follow the same pattern where only closely related organisms have the same mutations at the same location. 

The mutations match up this way with coding genes as well, but by the time we compare humans and chimpanzees we have the same genes located in the same location on the same chromosome but still about 400 million differences across the 3 billion base pairs making the difference around 1.2%. That’s still a lot of differences, but considering there are even more than that comparing chimpanzees to gorillas, there’s clear evidence that chimpanzees and humans are more related to each other than either is related to the other apes.

We can do this for every clade with at least two living organisms whose lineages diverged at that point in history providing much of the same as what I was doing here with us and chimpanzees. Comparing us to gorillas, orangutans, gibbons, colobus monkeys, new world monkeys, lemurs, rodents, Laurasiatherians (dogs, cats, cattle, whales), Atlantogenata (elephants, aardvarks, elephant shrews), Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and so forth paints the same picture. We are most related in a literal sense to organisms at the beginning of that list than those near the end (though I may have Atlantogenata and Xenarthra swapped or they may have diverged from Boreoeutheria before diverging into those two groups from there). Something like this - how those two clades arose and the order in which the divergence occurred, is mostly where evolutionary biology has turned to.

Presumably the viruses themselves have to be made *de novo*, because they'd otherwise entropy even if they were just ticking over in some accommodating conventional host reservoir, so...surely this should totally be a thing creationists make a bigger deal out of?

Here you have a falsifiable, testable hypothesis that would strongly support the claims of 'genetic entropy in viruses', and falsifiable, testable hypotheses are pretty slim on the ground in creationist circles, so I would imagine you should be promoting it strongly.

Wrong.

A) DNA is proposed as a later addition to the replicating, mutating, selecting repertoire (this whole thread concerns the RNA world hypothesis, remember)

B) configurations that permit replicative advantage will be MASSIVELY favoured over those that do not, and this is absolutely a natural law

So: poorly-replicating RNA oligomers will be overwhelmingly favoured over non-replicating RNA oligomers. Natural law. Some will mutate (natural law), and some mutated progeny will be better at self-replicating. They will be favoured over poorly-replicating ones (natural law) and so on, so forth.

t3_etledc,t3_etledc,"Excellent write up. *Really* nicely pitched. 

This bit in particular I feel needs more emphasis for any creationists reading:

&gt; Sanford’s argument *assumes* special creation because it *requires* an optimal “starting point” from which everything inevitably decays. That’s not what we see. Every genome has existed right on this knife’s edge, forever. 

Not just because Sanford does it, but because a lot of mathematical models by actual evolutionary scientists tacitly make this assumption, too.

The starting point for any given simulation of evolution is *not* an optimal genome, or even a reasonably good one. The nucleotides at any given locus should not be be assumed to be initially 'correct', and on the face of it, the very concept of a 'correct' nucleotide is itself a category error. 

The starting point for ongoing evolution should be the ""just good enough"" dumpster fire that all extant genomes are (and all ancestral genomes always have been).

The starting point for stuff closer to origins territory can be *even worse than that*, because as you note, the competition is always what else is around, and if what else is around is wholly non-functional, any function, no matter how bad, will be selected. And from there you swiftly evolve upward to the equilibrium point.",1580123391
t1_ff6z0bm,t3_es00mw,"Because that would be a violation of the fundamental basis of evolution. It’s more like distant cousins of the same kind of organism also being different enough to classify them into more exclusive categories. 

It’s like comparing long haired German Shepard dogs to short haired ones or living humans with light skin to those with dark skin. The differences at first will be very minor in the overall scheme of things but without taking into account genetic similarities and how sometimes they can both come from the same parents we might group them into different categories. 

More significant differences might be in the different breeds of cats, dogs, horses, and cattle where living humans don’t have many examples of this for this level of classification to have much of a meaning for us.

More significant differences build up on top of what is already there so that we have domestic dogs and wolves being members of the same species but categorized as different subspecies. The same thing occurs with other populations like the Darwin finches or by comparing us to Homo sapiens idaltu or time a more extreme example by comparing us to neanderthalensis where we could both be either classified as subpopulations of Homo heidelbergensis or as different species. Either way we’re talking about more isolated groups. By some criteria they’d be the same species but for other criteria they have some justification for classification as different species. 

More of the same eventually makes it so any offspring between the groups would be infertile with a transition between this and full fertility being observed where it might depend on which sex comes from which species for the offspring to also be fertile because of the species are swapped between the parents the hybrid can’t make any babies of its own. In other populations of organisms this doesn’t help much for these first few levels of classification because many groups produce asexually, only produce via hybrids, or they survive through parthenogenesis or hermaphroditism. For these groups genetic and morphological similarities are used more often than some criteria that doesn’t apply to them. 

For any level above genus in sexually reproducing organisms, there usually isn’t any interbreeding anymore at all. All of the higher classifications are based more on the time since their shared ancestors were still inter-fertile or possibly even the very same organism in some extreme cases and this is worked out through genetics mostly but can also be observed in how their embryos start out developing almost the same but differ in some key areas to tell us a bit more about the order in which the mutations occurred that are found in differences in the DNA, and when we are lucky enough to find them, transitional fossils paint the same picture. Genetics alone provides more evidence for common ancestry than can be attributed to separate ancestry, unless they were also identical enough we couldn’t tell them apart and they coincidentally had the same mutations occurring in precisely the same locations at the same time until they finally took their more recent forms. The evidence refutes the idea that dogs, cats, and humans were created fully formed on the same day. However the branching tree of life based on all of the evidence ever obtained and depicted within the phylogeny is the strongest evidence there ever was for common ancestry which is backed by genetics, embryo development and the fossil record. 

Nothing every transforms in a way that it is no longer the same kind of organism as its parents, but distant relatives (like 124^th cousins nine times removed) will start to show defining characteristics of belonging to different more exclusive categories and one of the categories has a label called “species” so that the origin of species is nothing like a fish giving birth to an amphibious that gave birth to a lizard that gave birth to dimetrodon that gave birth to gorgonopsid that gave birth to a shrew that gave birth to a colobus monkey that gave birth to a chimpanzee that gave birth to humans. Most of these lineages are sister groups to our own even if we could take a picture of ever mother of a mother of a a mother for the last six hundred million years and then to a page at random and find some noticeable similarities with their cousins living at that time.",1580122287

Euarchontaglires and Laurasiatheria split before the death of the non-avian dinosaurs with scrotatheria leading to fareungulata to farae to carnivores and eventually to dogs on that side of the split. The shared clade containing all of us is called boreoeutheria. Within Euarchontaglires, glires leads to rodents and rabbits with mice being on the rodent side of that split. More genetic similarity between us and mice than between us and dogs. A more recent split occurring around the time of the KT extinction event that killed the dinosaurs. Within euarchonta we have primates and plesiadapiformes, within primates we have wet nosed primates like lemurs, within dry nosed primates we have monkeys. We are monkeys. Within that we have old world and new world monkeys, all apes like us are old world monkeys and then among the apes, gibbons are lesser apes while gorillas, chimpanzees and humans are great apes. Hominidae is the great apes containing gorillas, humans, chimps, and orangutans while a subset of that called homininae contains gorillas, chimps, and humans but not orangutans which fall into the genus Pongo. The genus Gorilla splits from that leaving us chimps and humans in hominini and when panina split from hominina about six million years ago we are the only ones still around on our side of the split. What to we find? Almost 99% identical with members of hominini, about 98% across homininae, 96% across hominidae, 93% across all monkeys, 90% across euarkontaglires and 84% across boreoeutheria justifying the clades traditionally based on morphology.

Again, these percentages are based on the part that deals with morphological differences. If you compare the entire genome, the entire differences are a bit more like I shared for chimpanzees being only about 96% similar by whole genome comparison and mice only 50% but most of these differences don’t have a whole lot to do with morphological differences, and we expect and find an increased number of differences when they don’t result in major morphological changes than we find when they do. Genes that have no effect on survival are not exposed to natural selection and mutations pile up and persist more often in non coding regions than in the regions responsible for making proteins.

Here’s another link: http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics

Again, much of the same.

t1_ffpjrna,t3_es00mw,"If you look at the entire human and chimpanzee genomes the similarity is 96%

The 98.8% is the part that matters for phenotypical traits, but by comparing the entire genome we are still quite similar. The main differences are how we have defective genes still functional in chimps like those for the large chewing muscles and a tumor suppressor gene still present in us but not functional and the NOTCH 2L genes responsible for brain neuron development are the result of a copy paste error so that we have something like three copies of a gene chimps only have one of. On top of this we have a couple myostatin genes that also have some effect on our muscles. Then we have less thick and long body hair, and arched feet in place of their grasping feet, and we have an Achilles’ tendon not present in chimps. And then with the differences leading to more dedicated bipedalism and our smashed together chromosome 2A and 2B creating a single chromosome out of two complete with extra telomeres in the middle and an inactivated centromere still present, but otherwise the gene sequences across chromosome two are nearly identical as if you stuck both of their chromosomes end to end. 

All of these differences are what makes us human. These differences are also traceable to genetics and the fossil record as the lice that effects our heads and the lice that might inhabit our genitals are different species of lice - head lice is related to chimpanzee body lice and pubic lice is related to gorilla lice showing that by three million years ago, when Australopithecus afarensis was alive, our lineage was already a mostly naked ape. The whole sequence from Sahelanthropus to Homo were dedicated bipedal animals but all the way up to Ardipithecus they still spent at least some of the time in trees, though the mobility in our grasping feet was already being lost in favor of a straight foot as in other mammals but ours also became arched. Australopithecus afarensis had feet, pelvis, and other features almost exactly halfway, and they are also dated to have lived almost exactly halfway between Sahelanthropus and modern humans. From there most of the differences were the increasing size of the Achilles’ tendon already present in Australopithecus and the the further reduction in muscle mass in favor of a larger brain, though microcephaly and mutations resulting in twice the muscle mass and half the fat have happened since. 

The entire genome is 96% the same. Your 84% might apply to more distantly related apes, but you should correct your understanding if you think this applies to the similarity between us and chimpanzees. I used the gene sequence similarity, because those are responsible for the phenotypical traits and are a better measure of relatedness though the 96% similarity is even more evidence for common ancestry when you consider how most of that is junk DNA like broken genes in us that still work in them. 

If you extend this out to mice, there’s still a 90% similarity in the gene sequences and only a 50% similarity if you compare the entire genome of each. Some major differences with this is how all primates use the same gene regulation called Alu while mice use B/ID as they are both based on SINE gene regulation based on A to I gene regulation found in almost all eukaryotes but this one difference between us and mice is dated to about 65 million years ago, around the time the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct. We share a lot of homologies with mice, but obviously not nearly as many as we share with all primates, especially the old world monkeys, and especially the apes, and all of the evidence in genetics shows more and more relatedness the closer we get to our more recently originated clades - and as alluded to in the previous comment, we were so similar to neanderthalensis that we evidently interbred with them. Even with this ability, sapiens and neanderthalensis were distinct populations emerging out of Homo heidelbergensis where the lineage leading to neanderthalensis also led to denisova following that split where our side of that split was rhodesiensis getting so similar to what we find in the modern humans living now in the same location that we are clearly part of the same group. I don’t know the genetic similarity percentages between us and the most closely related groups within our own genus but all living humans are 99.5% genetically identical despite the noticeable phenotypical differences. In this case, I think this is whole genome similarity and not just gene sequence similarity. 

Without “cherry picking” out the part of the genome effected by natural selection and phenotypical differences, the same pattern is seen as what I alluded to last time. But, obviously, there is going to be very little selection to preserve useless junk so the mutations in them pile up and get passed on more often as there is at least the possibility of death or infertility if the coding genes change too drastically too fast. So as expected a 10% difference in 65 million years in coding genes equates to a 50% difference across the entire genome but when the coding genes are still barely more than 1% different, the entire genome differences are only about 4% showing that these differences between our lineages occurred more recently because of a more recent split between us and chimpanzees than there is between us and mice. Based on molecular clock dating in this case, the split between us and chimpanzees is correlated to the lifetime of Sahelanthropus and the rest of the sequence from that to us are where all of the human traits chimpanzees don’t have are found in us - the entire 4% difference occurring in about 6 million years.  The half of a percent difference in living humans occurred within 350,000-500,000 years with the oldest anatomically modern human fossil specimens dated within that range. 

We’ve also dated the the point that many of these differences occurred in our only lineage and not in the chimpanzee lineage such as the one leaving us a mostly naked ape being dated to around 3 million years ago, and the one effecting our increased brain mass coinciding with our loss of massive chewing muscles correlating time the time of Homo erectus which were already starting to look strikingly human in comparison to all other apes up to that time. And still they weren’t quite there yet as further changes occurred since with several other known lineage splitting away from our own since such as a dozen subspecies of Homo erectus and a handful of subspecies of Homo heidelbergensis even though our classification system currently classifies the descendants of that as different species like sapiens, neanderthalensis, and denisova. And then within sapiens there are a couple more subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens idaltu. 

And with the extinction of all of the side branches on our side of the split from the human-chimp ancestor and all but two on their side of the same split, there’s a more more noticeable difference between us and them than what we find within the extinct transitional forms and distant cousins on our side of that split. Even with all of these noticeable differences, the entire genome is still 96% identical where the part of that which provided the phenotypical differences being contained in a subset of the entire genome which is found to be about 98.8% identical across both lineages. Even with this, chimpanzees are even more genetically distinct from gorillas than they are from us because this 98.8% similarity with us is only 98.2% similarity comparing chimpanzees to gorillas.

&gt;Yes angular momentum is real and conserved, I chose my words poorly, but would be interfered with by flows moving up and down as well as north and south. These certainly confound the extremely simplistic views put forth in the article expecting a system with no other influences.

No it doesn't. Angular momentum is a vector quantity. North-south flows merely makes the angular momentum different from what you would expect using a solid spinning sphere approximation. It is still conserved, since torque on the Sun is negligible. Again, Physics 101 material.

&gt;It gets even worse when you consider the complex magnetic situation and the amount of energy I haven't run the numbers but general kinetic energy of even large system is puny compared to nuclear systems. So the convection of material up (heated material from near fusion) and down (cooled from radiation) should totally dwarf rotational energy particularly when you consider that new energy is created from mass constantly and there was a one time injection of rotation from the initial collapse of the pre-solar gas cloud collapsing from gravity.

Once again irrelevant. Energy is not what is under discussion. Angular momentum is.

&gt;The spin of the sun could be sped up or slowed down and that didn't seem taken into account. This is just like the creationist models of moon dust accretion to estimate and age of the moon that better suits creationist narrative.

t1_ffozmly,t3_eti3z7," After Satan failed to find majority support in heaven, he was expelled and denied significant interaction with heavenly beings (Revelation 12:7–9; Job 1:6–7, 2:1–2). This indicates that limits were placed on his activities just as limits were placed on his annoyance of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:1–3). The forces of evil are permitted to work within the bounds set by God and His plan to bring the reign of wickedness to a just end (Psalm 34:7; Revelation 13:5, 7, 15). Satan’s power over nature is beyond human capabilities (Job 1:12–19; Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7). He has the ability to manipulate diverse organisms as suggested in the account recorded in Job. At that time, Satan was able to induce experimental infection at will (Job 2:7). In understanding the latter phenomenon refer to my first article on the origin of pathogenic bacteria (e.g. staphylococci). It is also fruitful to refer to relatively recent community outbreaks where special environmental and contact conditions were shown to permit mass infection by Staphylococcus to occur.47 These observations may be taken to indicate that Satan possessed advanced knowledge on microbial behaviour and ecology at the time of Job. The Bible also speaks of thorns and thistles arising as a consequence of sin (Genesis 3:18). One possibility is that thorn-like structures arose through directed crossing and mutations, as has been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratory.48 Alternatively, they could have arisen through genetic manipulation. Such unusual  84 JOURNAL OF CREATION 30(2) 2016 || PAPERS outcomes have been achieved through using both classical breeding methods and genetic engineering.49 Genetic engineering involves horizontal transfer of genes. It seems untenable to acknowledge Satan’s great power over nature and his ability to perform the spectacular (Job 1:18–19; Matthew 4:8), which is well in excess of human capabilities, and then argue he cannot match human endeavours in the field of genetic engineering. Satan can alter existing information within limits, and he is at times able to use his human agents to do the unthinkable, as in biological warfare.50 After Satan’s expulsion from heaven, it might be expected that he would disrupt God’s creation and blame Him for the suffering caused, as creative ability is God’s hallmark (Isaiah 42:5, 65:17; Colossians 1:16). One of my basic premises is that pre-existing structures and mechanisms have functioned as prototypes to devise malignant forms. Ingenious combinations and innovations among genetic resources, particularly involving opportunistic organisms, could have facilitated pathogenic organism generation. The emergence of some viruses might represent an engineered result. However, a strategy to detect such occurrences would be difficult if not impossible to devise. Genesis and expression of pathogenic capabilities Virulence, the capacity to cause disease, is not strictly an intrinsic microbial characteristic but includes both microbial and host factors.51 With viruses, which are technically non-living entities, features other than intrinsic characteristics are emphasized.

t1_ffnup7p,t3_es00mw,"I agree that our naming conventions could use a bit of updating and consistency but I think I already explained it. It’s a matter of Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens idaltu being different groups of the same species but without calling them breeds. So we already have subspecies and neanderthalensis and denisova were even more different from us than Homo sapiens idaltu was. It is just easier to classify them as a different species than to write out something like Homo erectus ergaster antecessor heidelbergensis rhodesiensis sapiens sapiens for our group and Homo erectus ergaster antecessor heidelbergensis neanderthalensis for theirs. There are quite a few more subdivisions than were known way back when we were classified as Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and cladists shifted to a more simple Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis to indicate that we’re talking about genetically distinct populations and then with the discovery of Homo sapiens idaltu they brought back Homo sapiens sapiens though now some are starting to question even that naming convention. Of course, if you trace it back further when Homo erectus emerged out of Homo habilis before it also spawned several subspecies outside our own. We could have classified them as a subspecies of Homo habilis and the currently recognized subspecies of erectus as subpopulations of that. 

It’s a constantly branching tree where what we declare to be the species level shifts around for different reasons and where different groups living at the same time might be called subspecies of the same group, it just isn’t practical to keep tacking on another subgroup name to the end of it just because we discover that fertility is maintained in a much larger group than we originally expected. Maybe we could ditch the idea of species entirely unless we can agree on a consistent naming convention that works for all domains. Maybe groups that are more than 99% genetically identical could be where we could declare a group members of the same species and when they achieve 99.5% similarity classify them as subspecies and for even more similarities like 99.9997% that could be our “breeds.” Going in the other direction from this we see than we are something like 98.8% the same as chimpanzees just comparing our gene coding regions and they are 98.2% identical to gorillas comparing the same regions of their DNA. With genetics we can tell more about how closely different groups are related but we don’t necessarily have the tools available to establish genetic similarity when considering the fossilized remains of organisms dead longer than 50,000 years though, in extremely rare circumstances we can establish a greater amount of similarity that can be found comparing just teeth and bones. 

There are some hurdles to overcome here when the clade level naming conventions are based on limited information when it comes to fossils, and are a bit inconsistent already when trying to set a standard for how to declare organisms members of different species only to disagree where to set the boundaries.

Part of the problem that arises from this is our insistence on giving every organism a two or three part scientific name and when it just wouldn’t provide the same level of distinction between different groups if we started higher up in the family tree for the second part of the name given to the group and it wouldn’t provide the detail of “all of these things produce fertile hybrids with each other” if we shift species to a lower, more recent division among that group. You can’t have it both ways and maintain a short label for a distinct population as I showed earlier with shifting the species level all the way up to erectus with some suggestion that while erectus was still alive it too could create hybrids with sister populations living about the same time. It’s only really consistent among extant populations if we ignore all of the extinct intermediates  to where a short name can both identify a group as unique among the larger population while still making it clear about which populations can still produce fertile offspring like with Canis lupus lupus and Canis lupus familiarus for wolves and domestic dogs and then among those groups we can assign breeds to further distinguish one population from the next within the same subspecies without tacking on extra words to the scientific classification used for the whole group.

Of course, tracing our lineage back further yet, beyond the level of genus we don’t necessarily need to establish every single division along the way like I showed here from habilis to us and neanderthalensis. We may not even know what the common ancestor was if we either can’t find a fossil for the transition or if multiple different populations could be the species we are looking for. Usually when a clear ancestor descendant relationship isn’t known but they’re known to be part of the same group they’ll be classified as part of a sister clade instead. Even if we did establish that one particular population is ancestral to the entire clade isn’t isn’t practical to classify their direct descendants as subspecies and the descendants of those as subspecies of that and so on. It’s just easier to establish the point of divergence, identity the common ancestor of the whole group, and give that group a distinctive name like hominini, homininae, hominidae, “ape”, “old world monkey”, “monkeys,” “dry nosed primates”, primates, euarchonta, euarchontaglires, boreoeutheria, placentalia, eutheria, zatheria, holotheria, tribospenida, theria, mammal, therapsid, cynodont, synapsid, reptiliamorphs, tetrapods, stegalocephalians, sarcopterygii, osteichthyes, gnathostomes, vertebrates, chordates, etc. It is far easier to establish the ancestral group than every single species or every single organism along the way to becoming human in this case.

I regularly share the most recent video of the systematic classification of life as it comes out. I’ve shared more of them in r/evolution than in this debate sub. That series should explain everything you need to know for the evolution of molecules to man (if you count abiogenesis as part of this process) and for anything overlooked, scientific papers and the vertebrate paleontology series should provide you with whatever information is missing. It may not better justify our naming convention than I already attempted to here, but the names are less important than the evolutionary developments and the branching tree pattern of diversity providing us a reason to recognize each of the clades we still belong to. At the end of each video he builds upon the previous as for why we are still members of the clade in question, except in the first video where he mostly discusses what could reasonably be considered the root of the tree of life as the three domains of eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea with viruses being not quite alive and an example of DNA containing chemical systems that don’t fit the requirements to even be classified along with us in biota (or all life). The side branches that split from what eventually led to us are other examples of evolution being the mechanism by which diversity arises through speciation.",1580072464

t3_eu8zcr,t3_eu8zcr,"Well, the moon is moving away at a rate that would take 10 billion years to get to where it is now from the surface of our plant. 3.8 centimeters a year and a distance of 38.44 billion centimeters away. 

This rate, if consistent would be a problem for the proposed explanation for how our planet has a moon because of a collision 4.5 billion years ago, which is less than half that time but it would be an even bigger problem for their argument for a young Earth moon system as they tend to say something about there not being enough time to explain the moon existing even based on that theory as we could trace the speed of recession in reverse and the moon should have been sitting on the surface of the planet less than a billion years ago. I think they forgot to add a zero.

Also, there is other evidence for the length of time in a day and the rate at which the moon was moving away from us. It would seem to suggest that the rate it was moving away was even slower in the past, but this would only matter if it formed on the surface of the planet instead of out in space a fraction the distance away from us that it is now from the debris caused by that collision that was orbiting our planet before it coalesced into a moon. It’s a prime example of cherry picking the data and failing at simple division.

I’m not sure why the angular momentum of the sun matters but this could easily be explained by tidal forces from the planets. The same type of tidal forces that cause the same side of the moon to face our planet all the time. As the planets move slowly around the sun, gravity slows down the rotation of the sun. And with lighter mass abject than the sun causing this effect it would take a substantial amount of time, which is inconsistent with a young Earth just as much as their other argument about the recession of the moon.",1580070493

One example of this with the almost opposite problem is E. coli where none of them produce sexually but the genetics suggest they should be over a dozen different species based on the level genetic diversity. 

It is also about the offspring also being fertile when fertility is used as a marker for determining species because horses, zebras, and donkeys produce infertile hybrids. Something like this usually is enough to classify them as the same genus but the African cape dogs and domestic dogs can’t interbreed are all. 

Like I said before this naming convention is based on our human instinct to categorize and when talking about just one or a handful of generations between organisms the differences are not enough so that even if their descendants do eventually diverge into different populations we’d still classify everything on the edge of this point in time where the isolated groups lose this ability to breed as members of the parent species or group. When we don’t know exactly which individuals are ancestral we can still compare the genetic similarities of their descendants to find the point of divergence and classify them as members of the same clade as whatever happens to be ancestors and cousins to them.

Another way of putting this is that Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis are different genetically distinct populations and could just as easily be different subspecies of Homo heidelbergensis as they could be different species in the same genus though historically neanderthalensis has been classified as a subspecies of sapiens instead where another group, idaltu, is close enough to us to be more consistently accepted as subspecies of sapiens.

Intelligent design is creationism with new terms. This has been demonstrated with evidence. You can switch the terms and the arguments are the same. You don't have to keep lying to yourself about this anymore.

The evidence for evolution is overwhelming. But based on your rebuttal, I can see how you invent excuses to ignore that evidence.

By your argument, no one should ever be convicted of a crime because the judge, jury and lawyers involved didn't witness the crime. After all, how can they prove that it happened since they weren't there to see it?

""You didn't see it happen"" is a cop out from creationists.

Also, how is the fusion lending credibility to a designer or engineer doing this? No explanation given.

The fusion point is at telomeres on both ends. The chromosome has a vestigial centromere. Human chromosome 2 lines up with markers of two great ape chromosomes. All of that doesn't matter to you because someone didn't witness the fusion.

Do you understand how intellectually dishonest your rebuttal is?

&gt; The problem with your horses is that it lends the possibility it did happen with humans. But you again CAN'T Prove it. Since the ""common ancestors"" died out, we haven't seen it (or I am not aware of it. I will retract this point if it can be proven this did occur.) To prove this point, you would need to show either through simulation or experiment that this hybrid is able of interbreeding with itself or with either of the two different species.

Done: https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msn239

&gt; Furthermore, based on your first article, it contends that indeed the domestic and Przewalski's horses are closely related, but I don't see how you can claim when they branched off.

They have different number of chromosomes, and there are numerous genetic differences in the X chromosome between the two species (same paper). They are closely related but distinct populations.

&gt; And again. You would need to prove that this fusion did not change the functionality. If I take the wheel off the car, and fuse it to another wheel, it doesn't mean the car can go. I could have fused it perpendicularly to the wheel. That would be bad

We have the genes from our chromosome 2 and the two great ape chromosomes which fused into chromosome 2. Since the fusion point was in the telomeres, no genes were lost in the fusion. There you go.

It is several generations onward that distant cousins start to accumulate differences from each other, especially if the genes don’t blend back together on the population level across both groups. When this happens, us humans with a knack for categorizing organisms will see how group A had traits not found in group B. If they are sufficiently different enough by this time, especially if they can no longer produce fertile offspring they get classified as different species. If several of these “speciation” events occurred in the past based on morphological and gene comparison they are separated by that many clades since their common ancestor. The system isn’t perfect such that just within our own genus there may be five or six intermediates like Homo heidelbergensis before neanderthalensis and sapiens parted ways and this is another example of how categorization doesn’t alway reflect genetic isolation as accurately as you suggested where it would be always impossible for different species to produce fertile offspring because most humans alive today have the genetic evidence to establish that neanderthalensis and sapiens hybrids could, at least sometimes, be fertile.

All organisms are a member of a species. They arent a member of two or three species, just one. They can only interbreed within a single species.

Therefore, any particular organism either IS or ISNT homo sapiens. 

Therefore, at the moment that an organism is born, it either IS or ISNT homo sapiens

You believe that at one point in time no homo sapiens existed. And now they do, so logically you must believe that at SOME POINT the very first homo sapiens was born. Where is this homo sapien? 


here, let an evolutionist explain why you are wrong:
----------------------
""I had visited every state but Idaho. A few months ago, I finally got my opportunity to complete the roster of 50 by driving east from Spokane, Washington, into western Idaho. As I crossed the state line, I made the same feeble attempt at humor that so many of us try in similar situations: Gee, it doesn’t look a bit different from easternmost Washington. 

We make such comments because we feel the discomfort of discord between our mental needs and the world’s reality. Much of nature (including terrestrial real estate) is continuous, but both our mental and political structures require divisions and categories. We need to break large and continuous items into manageable units. 

Many people feel the same way about species as I do about Idaho-- but this feeling is wrong. Many people suppose that species must be arbitrary divisions of an evolutionary continuum in the same way that state boundaries are conventional divisions of unbroken land. Moreover, this is not merely an abstract issue of scientific theory but a pressing concern of political reality. The Endangered Species Act, for example, sets policy (with substantial teeth) for the preservation of species. But if species are only arbitrary divisions in nature’s continuity, then what are we trying to preserve and how shall we define it? I write this article to argue that such a reading of evolutionary theory is wrong and that species are almost always objective entities in nature."" --- Stephen Jay Gould.",1580053308

t1_ffl319v,t3_entwuz,"There isn’t nearly the crisis you make it out to be. Most of the extended evolutionary synthesis is already incorporated into the modern synthesis but it’s more of a testable hypotheses to see if certain aspects of biology play a larger role in evolution than we generally give them credit for like niche construction, for example. The fact that evolution happens is still a fact and it’s been observed happening no matter how far we zoom in on the genetics or how far back we observe the trends of a population. We’ve even seen new genes that cause a new function previously unseen or unnecessary until recent times. We’ve even seen the effects of artificial selection and even felt the effects of natural selection on top of observations of genetic drift, heredity, and speciation. 

The biggest deal with extended evolutionary synthesis is whether it in necessary as the current theory is already constantly updating the data or if it is actually a new revolutionary revision to how we look at evolution that we already know is happening. 

This is how science works - everyone always trying to one up everyone else by finding holes in our theories that they try to explain or by establishing whole new revolutionary fields of study.

&gt; https://answersingenesis.org/bible-history/is-josephus-reliable/


Lol, did you even read the link you cited? 

Here's the money quote:

&gt; &gt; Yet Josephus was not an eyewitness to most events in his works. His history is only as good as his sources. The early history in The Antiquities of the Jews is far removed from his own personal experience. We can only be sure of the details that coincide with Scripture, but the others are no more trustworthy than the traditions he relied upon.

First, it  points out that Josephus was not an eyewitness. We know this for one critical reason beyond his writings themselves:  *because Josephus wasn't even born until after Jesus death.*

You are just flat misinformed if you believe that there are *any* eyewitness reports of the key events of Jesus life or death, either in the bible or in any extra-biblical sources. Even the gospels themselves were not written by eyewitnesses. The earliest of the gospels was written in approximately 70AD, by an unknown author. 

In fact the only actual claim of anything even resembling eyewitness testimony are the writings of Paul, who does not claim to have met Jesus or witnessed any of the key events of his life. His only claim is to have had Jesus appear to him after his death. 

It is fucking amazing to me how many Christians lack even the most basic knowledge of the history of the book that they claim to believe. How on earth can you claim to believe this is true when you lack even the awareness that it was written decades after the events by people who did not witness them?",1580030635

t1_ffhgs4f,t3_eseb2k,"&gt;You don't want to know. 

This is not a sound argument. It's an ad-hom and an attempt to justify your lack of a convincing case, but it is not an actual case even if it were true. Also, it's false, and it's intrinsically about personal, internal motives that people are particularly bad at reading in others. Interestingly, one of the things that research has shown makes it difficult to see things from the perspective of others is ... fear. Huh!

As it stands right now,

\- I'm unconvinced of the ID conspiracy theory you're promoting, and

\- I'm unconvinced that it would call for a substantial change in mentality or in behavior even if it were true.

I'm unconvinced of the first because I think it's adequately explained by the motives they're claiming, which are not, when you look at them closely, an aim of Literally Killing Science or ushering in theocratic hegemony.

(Incidentally, the idea that religion and science are perpetually locked in an existential crisis that will kill one of them, is about 90% fabricated myth that was popular for a few decades before it was contradicted by scholarly research in the 1970's. Did you know that? I think a lot of anti-theists have not caught all the way up to yet.)

On the other hand, I am pretty sure well-convinced that fear makes it harder for a person to understand others, and easier to be controlled or deceived into less-than-rational decisions. This is an observation that has been made repeatedly, in various contexts, with fairly robust amounts of documentable rigor, for hundreds of years... is this something that you are skeptical of, or do we agree that's the case?

&gt; Seems to me that if anyone is scared, it's Creationists 

I have seen many creationists who are scared. It's clear from the Wedge Document that fear is present there. To be operating from a position of fear, would be a harmful thing for those ID proponents, don't you agree?

And yet ... it's not rational to look at fear as if it's something that only one side or the other has, or that the aim is to merely have less fear than the other side, right? If fear suppresses healthy reasoning, and if we want our reasoning to operate at its best, then fear is something we want to avoid as much as possible, isn't it? It's not a contest of which ""side"" can do so less than the ""other"", it's just a good way to be.

Understanding others--getting ""in their brain""--is crucial for learning and persuasion. Fear, anxiety, stress, and uncertainty makes it harder to do that. If you find yourself in a discussion with someone who you can tell is afraid, one of the best gifts you can offer is to model vulnerable courage and acknowledge shared values, because this can help those with whom you disagree to ease out of ""defensive"" mental mode and into one that is open to growth in understanding and learning. It's just a good way to be.",1580026166

t1_ffk6j9n,t3_etxl1s,"I’m not a Muslim, but newer scripture contains the understandings of people living more recently. They were already looking at embryos to see what they looked like without a microscope where as the Bible doesn’t discuss this at all. It’s still very wrong about how embryos develop and how it says that mountains stop Earthquakes somehow describing them as pegs or stakes nailing the planet in place. 

Alongside these crazy ideas found in scripture there were very early observations or at least assumptions of the diversity of life being a result of change. Even one guy suggested that a fish sprouted legs and eventually gave rise to people, though his explanation for how this would happen was absurd and didn’t account for DNA or subtle variations and selective pressures accounting for life basically evolving in all directions at once but with lineages that survive (because of various selective pressures) being the origin point for the next subtle change. They also didn’t know very much about deep time, plate tectonics, or stratification way back then either. 

Even though evolution had been suggested something like 2600 years ago, it lost favor at the time to emerging philosophies presented by Aristotle and Plato who themselves didn’t know anything about deep time, geology, or biology to make an accurate assessment. 

This slowly changed in the 1600-1700s as discoveries were made about these various fields of study and when they took note of various trends in biology and stratigraphy like how the rock layers seem to present a sequence of changing environments complete with their own flora and fauna with very simple life forms in the oldest rock layers and more advanced ones like mammals and humans in the most recent layers. To explain this apparent evolutionary trend and the observations, the branching hierarchy tree of life based on morphological similarity, and variability in nature several people people started presenting their hypotheses for *how* life evolves and not *if* it does. Lamarck suggested that giraffes have long necks due to many generations of stretching where Darwin suggested that natural selection and variability were the true driving forces of how life changes. He also suggested that we should find more in between forms in the fossil record describing what to expect and what we found fits his description being almost exactly halfway between two living groups in some cases and between old forms and new forms of the same group of animals for the rest. We should see birds with unfused wing fingers and apes with the gradual loss of the grasping feet in favor of more human shaped feet. We have several of each. That’s where the usual complaints from creationists are either that the changes aren’t drastic enough to count as evolution or they are so drastic that they count as different kinds. 
He didn’t publish his findings until Alfred Russel Wallace came up with essentially the same idea, but his contributions to science weren’t where we just declared the theory complete. It doesn’t stop with Darwin and like most scientific findings, the most recent papers usually have the most up to date information where the oldest make several errors or unsupported guesses. 

And, that’s just a bit of what we’ve learned since the Bible was written so it would truly be miraculous if the Bible got it right since the beginning but of course there’s a problem with accuracy riddled throughout.

People have interpreted “stretching out the heavens” various ways but in context it sounds most like literal stretching like a bedsheet over a mattress or some other material to span a gap like a trampoline surface is pulled right with springs. In this context and by interpreting the events of day two literally that say our planet is covered with a big solid dome the stretching out of the heavens would be like pulling a canvas tight over the dome so that at night we can see the stars as if they are a pattern in the background and not actuality the same thing that our planet orbits around. Another, slightly less liters interpretation would be a stretching of the sky over the planet so that there is an atmosphere allowing us to breath. In either case this god is said to live in heaven, a word that they regularly use to refer to the sky. This changes with astronomy and cosmology so that he doesn’t inhabit any location that we can travel to without being invisible and everywhere at the same time.

Somewhat related to the topic of creation vs evolution is both how Richard Owen suggested multiple creation events in place of evolution and the denial of young Earth creationists that they was ever a time longer than a single day that other life existed without humans being a part of the picture.",1580019587

t1_ffk5wns,t3_etxl1s,"Josephus himself demonstrates how fallible the gospels are. The Pharisees were not hypocrites, as the gospels depict them.

E.P. Sanders, an evangelical Christian one of the most prominent Professors of Judaism, wrote of the Pharisees thus, citing Josephus as one piece of evidence -

&gt; ""Similarly with regard to the Pharisees: others could see their scrupulous definition and fulfilment of the laws as being merely external activity that masked inner hypocrisy and self-righteousness, but they did not themselves see it that way. They thought that God had given them his law and bestowed on them his grace, and that it was their obligation within the loving relationship with God to obey the law precisely.

&gt; How do we know that they saw it this way? Partly by common-sense inferences based on observation of other religious polemic and defences. There are, however, passages that show that Pharisees themselves (and their rabbinic successors) regarded love and devotion to God as standing at the centre of their attempt to obey the law in every detail. According to Josephus many people followed the Pharisees’ rules of worship because they admired their high ideals, expressed ‘both in their way of living and in their discourse’ (Antiq. 18.15). Josephus saw them as being ‘affectionate to each other’, and he said that they cultivated ‘harmonious relations with the community’—unlike the Sadducees (War 2.166). That is, the Pharisees paid attention to the part of the law that says to love God and the neighbour. These passages in Josephus do not precisely describe inner motive, but their general thrust is relevant. Josephus is claiming that the Pharisees were good and kind and that their devotion to God was admired. We should also recall the depth of that devotion, which we summarized above: the willingness to die rather than be false to what they believed.

&gt; Explicit statements about motive come in rabbinic literature. I know of no body of literature that so emphasizes the importance of right intention and pure motive, of acting in a spirit of love and humility. Thus Hillel, in a saying retained in Aramaic: ‘A name made great is a name destroyed’ (Avot 1.13). To Hillel is also attributed this statement: ‘Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving mankind and bringing them nigh to the Law’ (Avot 1.12). According to Hillel’s predecessor Shemaiah, one should ‘love labour and hate mastery’ (Avot 1.10). The Pharisees did not regard themselves as observing the law for the sake of self-glorification.

&gt; The topic of motive, ‘intention’, is even more directly discussed by the post-70 rabbis, making use of the phrase ‘directing the heart’ (to God). The scholar who studies much is not superior to his fellow, the common person, provided that the latter ‘directs the heart to Heaven’ (Berakhot 17a). Similarly the size of an offering does not matter, and all are called ‘an odour of sweet savour’. This is ‘to teach that it is all one whether a man offers much or little, if only he directs his mind towards heaven’ (Menahot 13.11). I do not know of any sayings of this sort that are attributed to pre-70 Pharisees, but rabbinic literature attributes relatively few sayings (as distinct from legal discussions) to pre-70 Pharisees. I propose, however, that here as elsewhere the rabbis were the spiritual heirs of the Pharisees.

&gt; We may conclude that the Pharisees did not see their meticulous definition and observance of the law as being hypocritical and that they were not consciously seeking self-glorification; they were motivated by true religious devotion and the desire to serve God.""

You can introduce more mutations, and two things will happen faster (in the context of ""genetic entropy""). 1) you will hit the ""selection tipping point"" , and 2) you will reach the equilibrium point at which the frequency of good and bad mutations are approximately equal. 

Changing the *rate* at which mutations occurs does affect those two things happening, just how long it takes to reach equilibrium. 

&amp;nbsp;

And separately from the question of ""genetic entropy"", which is, being frank, not a serious idea, I will go further still, though admittedly I haven't done the theoretical nor empirical work to robustly support this position, but I have been convinced that it is the case.

I believe that the underlying theory of causing extinction via mutation *accumulation, over generations* is fundamentally flawed. And let me be clear: A significant portion of my work in graduate school was on that very thing, operating under the opposite paradigm. But I could not make it work, in a system where it should have worked.  [And I'm not convinced anyone else has, either](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/bu4h6t/no_error_catastrophe_has_never_been_demonstrated/). Lethal mutagenesis undoubtedly works, as long as you hit the target with enough mutagen to kill of severely damage everyone outright in a single generation. But if you give selection a chance to intervene, it will, and I don't think there's a middle ground where if you have mutations accumulate but the target remains viable, it eventually dies out rather than just resetting to a different equilibrium.

They are based on SINEs and this goes a bit into how this evolved from something they call A to I gene regulation (or something like that) and further development to this basic gene regulation shared by all mammals is what sets us apart from mice but places us firmly within primates. They are the only group that we know of with this specific form of gene regulation, though the counter argument would be that all primates plus this unrelated group containing humans were given the same gene regulation.

Considering that a flipped base pair would have a similar structure, and that a significant number of bases aren't going to be the ones interacting with the reagents in solution (there are only so many interactions on a ribonucleic base a ribozyme can use), the number of permutations increases pretty quick. There's also nothing precluding an entirely different 90 bases.

&gt; I am still assuming 1 sample per second.

90 rxn/sec is really slow. While enzymes are used, DNA replication is as fast as 1000 bases per second with the slow down of error checking mechanisms.

&gt; Are you still assuming only one simultaneous RNA?

Under what scenario would it make sense for RNA polymerization in a pool of reagents that encourages polymerization to only sample one polymer at a time?

&gt; The only observable source of information today, such as that in DNA, is an intelligent mind.

t1_ffjbqwk,t3_etxl1s,"And related even more to mammals is how monotremes still lay eggs that hatch almost immediately and what comes out of them is so underdeveloped and helpless that like marsupial embryos they must latch on and remain with their mothers more directly than any placental mammals ever did. Many marsupials also have a placenta just like us but it is smaller and less developed and kangaroos lack both the yolk sac and the placenta so that their offspring come out just as underdeveloped as monotremes produce with an egg. 

However, since monotremes still lay eggs as well as multituberculates and other evolutionary dead ends just within mammals we can find even more developmental and morphological similarity among all amniotes. Yes, there are skinks that lay eggs and give love birth in the same liter but they do it for a different reason and without the placenta to make up for it. 

Tracing this backwards in our evolutionary history takes us to a time when all amniote tetrapods still laid eggs as do most amphibians and fish but in our lineage amniotic fluid and a shell provided a benefit over the thin permeable membranes of those that can only survive embryonic development of the eggs are released in water or some other sufficiently damp environment. Dinosaurs, like birds and especially birds went the other way as the shells of their eggs became more calcified especially in the larger varieties where most reptiles and including most dinosaurs can lay a whole clutch of eggs but birds lay just one at a time because it lightens the load providing an additional benefit when it comes to flight even if they can can lay one a day and still wind up with a whole clutch of eggs.

The point here is that fossils, genetics, vestigial traits, and even living individuals paint the same picture. Mammals used to lay eggs where the embryos were nourished by yolk just like in reptiles before living mammals gradually shifted away from this towards live birth almost entirely. Even monotreme eggs don’t persist long so that if it wasn’t for them hatching almost right away it shows a trend towards live birth as most therian mammals have a placenta instead, even the marsupials, but in placental mammals gestation lasts longer and the placenta has to accommodate for that, while another lineage split from ours even sometimes losing the placenta as well but in their case having a pouch to store their offspring was better than relying on them to hold onto the hair of the abdomen of their mother. Holding onto hair as a means for survival isn’t nearly as sufficient as being tucked away in a pouch or coming out fully developed so it’s no wonder we only have three species of egg laying mammals left. 

Further mutations to this basic body plan at the point of divergence from their sister clades in each case comes into effect beyond this to explain how shrew shaped animals could give rise to four different lineages of placental mammals that dominate our planet over other varieties mostly seen in Australia. Part of this is found in the way mice and human genes perform nearly the same function and even have 96% amino acid coding similarity in some cases. This is beyond the topic of this post, but for more information I provided a recent post on some of our more recent evolutionary developments and our retention of mammal, primate, and monkey genes and gene regulation styles but with even more mutations accounting for why we don’t look or act exactly like modern chimpanzees or any of the other apes. 

We are reptilomorph amniotes, but we are also mammals, primates, dry nosed primates, monkeys, old world monkeys, apes, hominids, and members of hominidae, homininae, and hominini. More specific than this, and we’re the only ones left but we have Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Homo habilis, erectus, antecessor, heidelbergensis, and rhodesiensis to fill this “gap” between us and chimpanzees. It’s a continuous branching hierarchy where even continuously breeding populations evolve but if they ever become genetically isolated into two or more groups they give rise to ethnic groups, breeds, subspecies, and species slowly growing apart with a potential for hybridization providing us with several “in between” forms as well until the evolutionary divergence makes it nearly impossible to create fertile hybrids at which point continue divergence is inevitably as they eventually can’t interbreed at all and they even start looking like different groups entirely. This is where creationists tend to accept them as the same group if they still look the same as long as humans are in their own group but they won’t or don’t accept the higher levels of classification as evidence of common ancestry. Until they’ll admit we are apes, monkeys, and primates even still it’s going to be hard for them to admit that mammals are amniote reptiliamorphs or walking fish or if they do accept it they won’t include us as part of the group. It won’t allow us to be extra special - and that’s what it boils down to - even if being made in the image of God implies that their god looks like a human, which is a problem for another time.",1580001354

I know defenders of Sanford/Carter, and they themselves like to say that there was a gradual decline of ""fitness"" aka mortality, but that simply isn't the case. They argue that if the decline in deaths from H1N1 were due to advances in medical tech, or similar then we should see a drastic reduction in deaths when said ""tech"" was introduced. As an example of what they think we should see, we can look at data for Chickenpox, for which we have really good year to year data, and can see clear trends which result from advances in medicine. [Graphs here](https://vaccines.procon.org/vaccine-histories-and-impact/varicella-chickenpox/)

However, H1N1 isn't persistent in humans, and Sanford/Carter are really only working with 4 data points during the last century. They want to say the the invention of antibiotics didn't have an effect, because they can't see a direct correlation in their data. However, they have zero, zip, nadda, nothing, no data that covers the period in which the widespread use of antibiotics occurred. 

Penicillin was invented in 1928, and adopted for widespread use soon after. Sanford/Carter would like to convince you that since they don't see a precipitous drop in flu mortality during the 1930's any decline in mortality was due to genetic entropy. The thing is, they don't have any data from the 1930's, or the 40's, or the 20'. They have data from 1918, and from 1955, and **nothing in between** 

Grabbing the first results from Google, I see the the 1918 pandemic killed 150 per 1000 infected. In 1955 that number was 6 per 1000. That's a 25 fold decrease in mortality. Sanford and co would like you to believe that because they have no data the corresponds to the invention of antibiotics, those could absolutely not be the cause.  They would also like you the believe that because they can draw a straight line between 2 points that somehow make their model correct. 

I could make the same argument for chickenpox. Pick a year... 1980-something, and then compare the mortality to today. You'll see the same 30... 50... 100... fold decrease in in mortality. Does that mean chickenpox genetically entropy'd itself into near extinction? No of course not, the drop in mortality is because anyone older then 25 has almost certainly been vaccinated.",1579998601

I have a question. Something I've wondered about for some time:

You're making this argument in general theoretical terms, implying that it would apply regardless of the relevant biological parametres. As in, genetic entropy is inherently a contradiction in terms and therefore cannot ever happen.

Well, suppose you imagine a hypothetical human population, where we artificially raise the mutation rate by increments and observe the consequences. Such that it gradually increases from 100 per person per generation to 200, to 300, to 400 etc.

Are you arguing this population would, every time we ramped up the mutation rate, just settle on a new mutation-selection equilibrium? Ad infinitum? Or would the elevated mutation rate eventually cause a problem, and what would the nature of that problem be?",1579989862
t1_ffikxeq,t3_etjksh,"Are you assuming that that is the only possible sequence?

At this time we don't know the exact function of &gt; 98% of nucleotides in the genome.  Even if we did, the function is [highly redundant](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/17/6131.long), ""such that double or triple disruptions are required for a phenotypic consequence.""

My [Junk DNA article](https://bereanarchive.org/articles/biology/functional-dna) makes the case that enough of our DNA is functional that we likely receive dozens of deleterious mutations per generation, based on several overlapping evidences of function, even though we usually don't know what specific functions a nucleotide contributes to.

&gt; Do you think there's significant empirical evidence that genomes are generally deteriorating?

I think the process is so slow in large complex animals like us that it's hard to measure.  I have this blurb saved in my notes, but I haven't yet had time to dig through the research behind it:

1.  ""the results suggest that humans are carrying around larger numbers of deleterious mutations than they did a few thousand years ago. But this doesn’t mean that humans now are more susceptible to disease, says Akey.

If we were to group HIV differently, we would have seen some go “extinct”. If the criteria which sorted various genomes  into a “strain” were narrow  enough, at some point due to mutations that met those criteria. I know that might not be self-evident, so I’ll make an absurdist example to demonstrate it. Imagine that a “strain” was defined having a singular and exact genome as the criteria for set inclusion. Only in the case that  mutation from that genome was deleterious would one anticipate that exact genome lasting more than few generations. Any possibility of positive or neutral mutations would mean that the original genome would very quickly becoming increasingly less represented among an ever-increasing number of other (presumably similarly defined) virus genomes. 

Now of course, HIV strains aren’t defined that way. There is considerable genetic variation within a strain. The particular boundaries of what genomes are included in a strain have been rationally developed, but are in some sense still arbitrary. They have been defined as having particular attributes in genotype or etiology, and are defined broadly enough to be useful (having a strain per genome is pointless) for categorization, but narrow enough to allow useful description.

&gt; Let’s say one deleterious mutation occurs. So that removes 1 out of 20 possible deleterious mutations. But we also remove the second deleterious mutation from the mutated site, because it’s now neutral, relative to the first mutation. So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. And the overall ratio for the ten sites, instead of 10/0/20 (b/n/d), is now 11/1/18.

&gt; So how many deleterious mutations must occur before we reach an equilibrium? Let’s see.   
after 2: 12/2/16.   
after 3: 13/3/14. (We’re already at a tipping point where most mutations are not deleterious.)   
One more and it’s 14/4/12, and a plurality are beneficial.

I want to figure out what you're saying here. 
Let's assume that at that mutated site, A is the original base. With 1 beneficial and two deleterious, lets say that beneficial is A-&gt;T and deleterious is A--&gt;G and A-&gt;C. 

So with one deleterious mutation, A-&gt;C happens. We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (beneficial relative to C),     
C-&gt;T (very beneficial relative to C), and     
C-&gt;G (from one bad thing to a different bad thing)

&gt; So instead of 1 beneficial and 2 deleterious mutations possible at that site, it’s 2 beneficial and 1 neutral. 

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 2/1/0

Initially we postulated 1 b and 2d at this site. Now we have 2b and one n. **BUT** the problem is how you are defining things. You're saying that it's beneficial relative to where it is now.  If we look at the original genome and see what it is, we get a different situation:

A bad mutation has happened (A-&gt;C).  We now have the possibilities of    
C-&gt;A (neutral relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;T (beneficial relative to the original genome)
C-&gt;G (deleterious relative to the original genome)

So we start with 1/0/2 and then get 1/1/1

I have trouble with you defining C-&gt;A as beneficial and C-&gt;G as neutral.  I suspect that if you follow it through using this way of looking at it, you'll end up with quite different results (maybe you or someone could crank this out. I had to actually use 4 specific bases in order to follow what's going on).

This is a problem for two reasons: 

First, if, as they claim, the pre-'09 strains went extinct in '09, then it's completely inappropriate the just add all the mutations together - the '09 pandemic should represent a completely new lineage. 

Second, we know that the '09 pandemic was a reassorted (i.e. recombinant) strain, so most of those differences weren't due to single-base point mutations - they were due to recombination between different strains. Surely Carter and Sanford know this, so it's dishonest of them to treat those changes as though they are due to single-base substitutions accumulating over time.

There was no non-sequitur because when you start with one gene and a mutated form arises now you have two forms and if two new one arise from those now you have for such that a single population having a single version of a gene now has at least for so that diversity is the result. The alternative would be identical clones because of mutation so that every organism was identical so that no diversity existed. This variety is the necessary diversity for natural selection because without it a single environment would kill all of them at once or it wouldn’t have any purifying effect at all. To select you need variety to choose from. These work hand in hand.",1579952241

And going back to the paper myself, the answer is YES, that's exactly what they do. *That's* what figure 2 shows. They're counting cumulative mutations in H1N1 from 1917 *to 2012* across this supposed extinction.

There is no compelling evidence that even the adaptability of e.coli is from 'mutation'.  That is hypothesized. The more likely explanation is the INHERENT ability of bacteria to adapt, by the unique ability of making slight changes to it's enzyme secretion.  Mutations, as a force on EVERY organism,  are deleterious.  They do NOT increase complexity or add functions.  To ascribe to 'mutation!' this ability of ecoli is spurious, at best.  It is an interesting theory, but it is not clearly established that mutation was the mechanism for adaptation, in this specific case.  That is assumed.

Then, to seize upon this study as 'proof of common ancestry!', is a greater leap of faith (and logic).  There is no transitional form being 'created', even after 66,000 generations.  A fruit fly study went to millions of generations, with still no transitional forms being created, under forced laboratory conditions.

Varying enzyme secretion is an inherent trait..  it is not, scientifically,  an example of mutation.   That is a theory, and not a compelling one, imo.

But even if it could be shown that deleterious mutations of genes can occasionally 'help' a bacteria to adapt, which this study does not, it is a leap of faith to conclude 'common ancestry!', via mutation.

t1_ff85yt0,t3_emxcfo,"&gt;The thread title was about genetics as evidence for evolution so thats why your invoking fossils is out of order and you should be making your case on genetics anyways.

You said that the conclusion of Africa being the place of humanity's 
origin was ""wild"". While genetic evidence alone is more than sufficient, such accusations still warrant mentioning some of the evidence.

&gt;As i said variation is relative to need, at least as a option

That would first need to be demonstrated, and yet it never has. And the thing is, many populations of animals with low diversity would greatly benefit from such a mechanism if it existed, and yet they don't. Tests have shown again and again that diversity in a species do not happen you the way you wish it did.

And then fact that most of the diversity in question is non-coding parts and that, as repeatedly stated, the pattern is for what the original human population would look like is ridiculously specific and Africa fits it to a T.

&gt;its a old time guess that diversity equals origin of the being's bodyplan. variation on varition is just more needed variation and is not proof of the beginning of a trail. or even suggestive.

Take a small portion of a larger population of deer and put them in a new environment were they now have limited gene flow with the original population. These deer will only have a portion of the original population's diversity. Now, after the new population has grown did it again. This new population will have even less. Do it again and again and this is exactly what the pattern of human diversity is like. And seeing as how extensive study no other process does the same, calling it suggestive would be an understatement even ignoring the vast amount of fossil evidence..

&gt;Well your suggesting traits were gained in africa, and not lost upon moving to India etc. Well thats a guess. I say instead they gained the same traits without ever being in Africa and the genetics along with it. The facts are they have close traits and this , I say as a option, from the area they live and likewise people who moved to africa got like traits and a ee bit more. thus the origin of more genetic diversity to others.

That was nothing to do with diversity. Traits like skin pigment are under selective pressure, and so are of little use Put fair skinned people under conditions and keep them isolated and slowly those with mutations for darker skin will become more common. And that is why such traits are not considered when who is descended from who. It is the parts of the genome that do not code for anything that are.

All you have shown is that you seem lack understanding of what genetic diversity, which is what is being debated about, even is in the first place.

&gt;Finally nothing has shown genetic change comes only, or at all, by mutations. they just presume that because they have no other idea of a mechanism to change dna.

Not ideas, observations. Seeing as how mutation is defined as ""the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, that is the definition. Mutations being a result of only random process or deliberate modification by humans using advanced technology has been repeatably tested, not just assumed and asserted as truth like you do.

&gt; peoples bodyplan differences since the flood is the great obvious evidence. its impossible where we needed some change that only a few offspring got it from mutations and only they created new populations. God would not allow that.

This is a good example of confusing the claim for evidence, which is ultimately all you have done here. You assume a YEC timeline because of what you perceive the Bible to say, and take that as evidence. But the Bible would only be a claim, not evidence. And all you have done is ignore all actual evidence and make things up and claim them as fact.

And Bible isn't even the claim, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, which you quiet tellingly have ignored, in [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/emxcfo/whats_the_creationist_explanation_for_these_human/ff2cblf/).

Lol, your boi Sanford is actually looking at swine flu fam.   
Sanford uses A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) as one of two reference genomes for his paper. These sequences were taken from the Christman et al. 2011 paper (erroneously referred to as Kedwaii et al. in Sanford's paper).  H1N1pdm reference strain A/California/04/2009 was classified as genotype  \[C, D, E, 1A, A, 1F, F, 1A\], with a lineage assigned sequentially to each of the eight genomic segments. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm) virus arose from a reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, namely, a North American H1N2 and a Eurasian H1N1, each of which themselves arose from reassortments (Fig. 2) ([Garten et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0100), [Gibbs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0110), [Smith et al., 2009a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0275), [Smith et al., 2009b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0280), [Trifonov et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811000633?via%3Dihub#bib0315)). The North American swine virus was itself formed by at least two  previous reassortments in swine, contributing six segments: PB2, PB1,  PA, HA, NP, and NS. 

  
The quote from Sanford:

"" We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1  outbreak of 2009–2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. ""

------------------------------------------------------

Like all other molecules the molecules required for early life are self-powered by the behavior of [matter/energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qHS5IrO0I&amp;list=PLPCENRDc3DcTAW6uMMi3HNjF8Fvpn6vWx). Before cells that would quickly consume plasma of another were around living plasma could come to life every time a large water body had enough food filled rain, to produce more components of TNA, RNA, DNA, etc.. The whole giant thing would add up to one giant cell, where self-replicating molecules are free to eat/assimilate molecules that help keep their developing self-powered bodies alive.

To modern bacteria a water body filled with plasma is a [yummy bowl of jello](https://originoflifeaquarium.blogspot.com/), any that may still form would be eaten. But before plasma started consuming itself there was only consumption of building block molecules that fall or flow into it, using molecular attraction to draw them in and toothy molecular bonds to lock in place in its developing living (water) body.

At the end of the summary is a review paper with this illustration showing what the (as of 2017) known molecular pathways towards more complex living things (modern cells) look like. It's not an easy read but that's what is now needed to have some understanding of what is now known, in some cases [easily demonstrated](https://sites.google.com/site/garysgaulin/home/NSTA2007.pdf) like [vesicle formation](https://discourse.numenta.org/t/python-program-using-lennard-jones-force-to-approximate-cortical-stem-cell-close-packing-symmetry/6456/5).

1 carbon methane and other abundant starting molecules form increasingly complex molecules as a molten planet cools enough for liquid water to cover it, increasingly complex organic molecules are able to form.

We can start with simple sugars, cyanide derivatives, phosphate and RNA nucleotides, illustrated in ""How Did Life Begin? Untangling the origins of organisms will require experiments at the tiniest scales and observations at the vastest."" with for clarity complementary hydrogen atoms not shown:

The illustration shows (with hydrogen removed for clarity) the origin of life related 2 and 3 carbon sugars, of the 2,3,4,5 progression as they gain additional carbon atoms to become (pent) 5 carbon sugars (that can adopt several structures depending on conditions) now used in our cell chemistry.

&gt;More recently, polymerase engineering efforts have identified TNA polymerases that can copy genetic information back and forth between DNA and TNA.[5][6] TNA replication occurs through a process that mimics RNA replication. In these systems, TNA is reverse transcribed into DNA, the DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and then forward transcribed back into TNA.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threose_nucleic_acid

Mixtures of 4 carbon sugars take on a life of their own, by reacting to form compatible RNA and DNA strands to set the stage for metabolism of 5 carbon sugar backbones that add the ability to be used to store long term (genetic) memories by ordering its base pairs.

There is only one product species from a given reaction, not random mixtures as is often claimed from experiments where many reactions were at the same happening in the vessel and some isomers were only useful as a food source by the tiniest of living things.

True to the reduced capacity for honesty in creationist circles, /u/PaulDouglasPrice flagrantly disregards 30 instances of the word ""extinct"" in relationship to H1N1 and unabashedly lies about it:   


  

""We document multiple **extinction** events, including the previously known **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second **extinction** of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009.""

""These **extinctions** appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations.""

""Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957, when the human strain went **extinct**.""

""Apart from the 1917 pandemic, H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic, and human H1N1 essentially went **extinct** from 1957–1977.""

""Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual **extinction** of the viral strain.""

""Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (“lethal mutagenesis”) may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain **extinction** \[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B25)\-[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B30)\].""

""Others have noted the temporal **extinction** of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""This discontinuity reflects the **extinction** of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s, followed by the re-introduction of the strain in 1976, presumably from a researcher’s freezer.""

""Notice that after re-introduction in 1976, the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the **extinction** occurred in the 1950s.""

""These fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 **extinction**.""

""However, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic (the porcine lineage had no **extinction** event, and hence no pause in mutation accumulation).""

""Human H1N1, the remnant of the 1918 lineage, appears to have gone **extinct** a second time.""

""Before its apparent **extinction** in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations (mostly point mutations), including 320 non-synonymous mutations, compared to the 1918 genotype.""

""This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time, perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as **extinction** approaches.""

""This is only possible if almost **all human influenza** lineages rapidly go **extinct**.""

""We show compelling new evidence supporting the **extinction** of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second **extinction** event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. Strain **extinction** has often occurred when new strains appeared, including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3-like strains in 1917, H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957, and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507676/#B5)\].""

""Our other evidences include: a) the **extinction** of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent **extinction** of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.""

""Finally, the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline, attenuation, **extinction** of most circulating strains, and even more frequent sub-lineage **extinction** events.""

""These facts, combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain **extinction**, all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.""

""Thus, the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual **extinction**.""

""Based on our mutation count analysis, there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone **extinct**, apparently twice.""

""The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago, and there has been universal **extinction** of all earlier human influenza strains.""

""Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went **extinct** in 1957, but was reintroduced in 1976, apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s.""

t1_ffgw1do,t3_eti3z7,"I'll explain this to you very clearly. They are referring to the specific strain they call the ""human version"" of H1N1, which is frequently called Spanish Flu. It came about in 1917 and went extinct first in the 1950s. It was re-released from containment in the 1970s and then went extinct a second time in 2009. However, in the 1950s the human strain jumped into swine before it went extinct. That swine version made a jump back to humans in 2009, and the mutational load shows a linear progression going all the way back to 1917. So even though the Spanish Flu jumped to pigs and reassorted, it kept accumulating mutations nonetheless. And this is why the 2009 swine flu was very weak compared to many fears. It was already highly attenuated when it jumped back to humans.

t1_ffgtyi8,t3_etjksh,"The word ""information"" is difficult to define without context, and you're playing with that ambiguity to try to make this argument.

In the general sense, information is just what we call it when a something could conceivably exist in multiple states, but that uncertainty has been resolved and it exists in only one of those states. Imagine three rocks in a line on the beach (A, B, and C). Picking a starting point and moving down the line, the order could be any of six sequences: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, or CBA. But even though there are six possible arrangements, the rocks exist in only one of the six. Let's say its BCA. That is information. The existence of information is in no way contingent on an intelligent agent.

You're blurring that with the idea of idea of encoding and decoding information. Systems can take information and encode it into a storage medium. You have already provided two examples: synaptic connections in the brain and cave paintings. Another obvious example is written language. Later on we decode that storage medium to get the information back. You see a tiger, you write ""I saw a tiger"" in a letter and mail it to  me, I read the letter and I know that you saw a tiger. We encoded and decoded information. Even here, there is no basis to assert that says a system needs to be intelligent to encode or decode information. Most life lacks any cognitive ability whatsoever, and they still manage to receive, store, transmit, and respond to information.

You're giving examples of ""encoding information"" but passing them off as if they were ""producing information"". It really doesn't matter which one we look at, except for clarity sake.

Wrong. The only *observable* source of information today is a ***human*** mind. Not some sort of unspecific ""intelligent"" mind, but a ***human*** mind. If you disagree, please clue me in on any ***abservations*** that have been made of information whose source is a *non-human* intelligent mind.

This would be a more accurate analogy. This isn't painting on a cave wall, its nature doing natural things according to the physical world, and humans looking into this natural occurances to deduce information.

H1N1pdm2009, the 2009 pandemic strain, is still very much alive and well. Sanford and Carter said H1N1 went extinct in 2009. Were they referring to the pdm2009 strain, or some other strain unrelated to that pandemic?",1579916504

t1_ffgsw4b,t3_eti3z7,"No - lower virulence can facilitate a wider spread, and is particularly useful when hosts are in short supply, e.g. after the initial peak of a pandemic, when most potential hosts are already resistant after having been infected.

t1_fdpm1o8,t3_ed34gu,"Sorry was a bit busy last week.

Last call by me: so if you insist, you may attribute biodiversity to anything you like: you want it to be geology? Fine then. You even may want to call them cosmological feats. whatever.

Simply this: biodiversity has changed over time, as the fossil evidence greatly and massively shows. And a change in biodiversity is just putting ""evolution"" in other words.

&gt; I understand you see biodiversity changing by way of fossils.

No i do not see biodiversity changing by way of fossils, I OBSERVE that biodiversity changes ove rgeological formations and layers. Because fossil types (""species"") come and go and when they go, they are gone for ever.

There is really NO GETTING AROUND this simple and plain observation. Biodiversity changed. And this is called evolution.",1579915629

t1_ff9gmqg,t3_es11qk,"&gt; If most small, deleterious mutations cannot be selected against, and build up in the genome, what real-world, tested mechanism can evolution call upon to stop mutational meltdown?

Indeed very small *individual* mutations may escape selective pressure. But sooner or later, *many* of them will inevitably surpass the threshold of selective pressure. And then they will be weeded out by selection.

And the funny thing here is that creationists, unknowingly and naively, actually bring in arguments that endorse this: they say that genetic entropy will occur, degrading the genome. But degrading the genome implies that fitness will inevitably decrease. So, to bolster that, Price came up a week ago with many examples of what he thinks happens in humans (all kinds of genetic conditions and the like). But as soon these happen and while such conditions ARE affecting fitness, as extensively explaned by Price himself, selection WILL kick in. *Unless* we prevent natural selection to act by medical intervention. IF deteriration of the human genome happens it's most likely due to unabling natural selection by humans themselves. 

I already explained that before but Price is a typical creationist: dodging argument she can't address and blocking others who insist on answers.",1579914703
